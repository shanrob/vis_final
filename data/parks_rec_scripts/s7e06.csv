Tom Haverford,In front of you are six different wedding cakes from the top restaurants in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Sample each one, and rank your two top favorites in the ballots provided."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy."
Jerry Gergich,"They're all so good, I can't pick just two."
Tom Haverford,"Well, then you leave, Terry."
Tom Haverford,And pay for the cake you already ate.
Joe,I like the vanilla one with the lemon cream.
Craig Middlebrooks,"That was a joke cake I got from the grocery store, to weed out low quality palates."
Donna Meagle,"Maybe it's because he's my fiance and I love him, but I kind of like the grocery store one, too."
Tom Haverford,There's actually one more cake you haven't tried yet.
Tom Haverford,Donna has chosen me to be the Butler of Honor at her wedding.
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, ""Butler of Honor"" is a term I made up, but it's not a job I take lightly."
Tom Haverford,That's why I'm about to give her a surprise bigger than when LeBron went back to Miami.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,DJ Bluntz?
Donna Meagle,What is happening right now?
Tom Haverford,I think you know what's happening.
Joe,"But but for real, though."
Joe,What what's happening?
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self 2017!
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self 2017!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,Is this for real?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, it's for real."
Tom Haverford,And it's the biggest one yet.
Joe,I still don't know what's happening.
Joe,"So, what's happening?"
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self!
Joe,Not an answer to my question.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, read the cake."
Joe,Still unclear.
Joe,"Terry, what's happening?"
Jerry Gergich,Treat Yo' Self.
Tom Haverford,It's the best day of the year!
Donna Meagle,It's the best day of the year!
Trodd,"Roscoe, people in this town are very angry about Gryzzl's data mining program."
Trodd,"In your opinion, have you done anything wrong?"
Roscoe,"We did not believe that we did anything to invade people's privacy, Trodd."
Roscoe,"But then, we checked thousands of emails and texts between our customers and their loved ones, and it seemed like people thought we were wrong."
Trodd,Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.
Trodd,How will you win back our trust?
Roscoe,We are gonna be throwing a free concert with U2 and Beyonce.
Roscoe,"Tickets are already on your phones, seating is gonna be organized by income and sexual history."
Roscoe,"And that, I swear, is the last time that we will be peeking inside your computers."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting."
Andy Dwyer,I've got something big and exciting.
Andy Dwyer,All we need is a blimp and a decoy blimp.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps."
Leslie Knope,We already have an idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Our new proposal will ask them to split the land.
April Ludgate,Gryzzl will take half for their campus and then donate the rest to National Parks.
April Ludgate,"It's not ideal, but they may go for it because of how bad they screwed up."
Ron Swanson,"I am not a spy, and I would never reveal classified information."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have to say that every time?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,But I know Gryzzl is dead set on owning the entire parcel.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure this plan will work.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it doesn't, something will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when you and I team up, great things happen."
Leslie Knope,"Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby."
Leslie Knope,"And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a... We're in sync emotionally.
Leslie Knope,Stop patting my head.
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like Newport Trust is making an announcement.
Jessica Wicks,"Last week, the Newport Trust told Gryzzl, in no uncertain terms, that we would not do business with a company that invades our privacy."
Jessica Wicks,"Then, Gryzzl upped their offer to $125 million, and I swear to God, y'all, I nearly fainted."
Jessica Wicks,So we are officially jumping the gun and selling to Gryzzl for $125 million.
Leslie Knope,What?
Jessica Wicks,Let me repeat that because it makes me very horny.
Ron Swanson,"C'mon, Knope."
Jessica Wicks,$125 million.
Ron Swanson,How about we go drown our sorrows in some waffles?
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self
Lucy,"Hey, boss."
Lucy,"Before you go, can you sign some checks?"
Lucy,Do mine first.
Lucy,"In case something happens to you, I wanna make sure I get paid."
Tom Haverford,Looking out for number one.
Tom Haverford,Always smart.
Tom Haverford,"So, how is post-breakup life?"
Lucy,"Well, breakups are famously super fun and make everyone feel awesome."
Lucy,"So, it's no different."
Donna Meagle,You should come to my wedding.
Donna Meagle,It's gonna be hella fun.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you should come with me."
Tom Haverford,"As, like, a plus-one type thing."
Tom Haverford,Maybe we just go as work friends.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe it's just even, you know, boss, employee type thing."
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,That's what you should do.
Tom Haverford,You should come to the wedding... And do paperwork.
Lucy,"Stop, you're making this sound almost too fun."
Tom Haverford,"Whatever, just text me when you decide."
Tom Haverford,I literally couldn't care less.
Tom Haverford,"So, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Let's hit it, Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Um, can we talk about that disastrous interaction you just had with Lucy?"
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,All we're talking about is treating yo' self.
Tom Haverford,Today is about one thing.
Tom Haverford,Things.
Tom Haverford,"Things, Donna!"
Tom Haverford,Our favorite.
Donna Meagle,"Well, where is Bluntz taking us?"
Donna Meagle,This is not the way to the mall.
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause we're not going to the mall.
Tom Haverford,We're finally gonna do something we've always talked about.
Donna Meagle,No way.
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.
Tom Haverford,In Beverly Hills!
Leslie Knope,All I wanted was valued at 100 million dollars given to me for free.
Leslie Knope,Is that too much to ask?
April Ludgate,I'll say it again.
April Ludgate,Voodoo is still an option.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,They won.
Leslie Knope,Everything is changing.
Leslie Knope,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.
Leslie Knope,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.
JJ,What can I get you guys?
Leslie Knope,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.
Leslie Knope,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel."
Leslie Knope,But I think the town is losing some of its charm.
Leslie Knope,And there's too much kale now.
Leslie Knope,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.
Leslie Knope,"My milkshake, you guys."
Ron Swanson,"Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing."
JJ,"Well, I agree with you."
JJ,But the guy who bought the property didn't even give me a chance to re-up the lease.
JJ,Can't win 'em all.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Enough is enough.
Leslie Knope,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles."
Leslie Knope,JJ.
JJ,What?
JJ,Is something wrong?
Leslie Knope,"No, nothing is ever wrong here."
Leslie Knope,That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter."
Ben Wyatt,Who is it?
JJ,It was a company with a weird sounding name.
JJ,Hang on.
Andy Dwyer,Was it Putin?
Andy Dwyer,"Voldemort Putin, of Russia?"
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to take that bastard down.
JJ,Here it is.
JJ,"""Thigh Gap, LLC Owner, Dennis Feinstein."""
Leslie Knope,The cologne guy?
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, figures."
Leslie Knope,That guy is the worst.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take him down with an old fashioned public rally.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days."
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,Tiny rolled up scrolls delivered by trained foxes.
April Ludgate,I'm on it.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hell, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Blimp time.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I think this is a job for Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Even better.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what do you say?"
Leslie Knope,Dynamic duo get together one more time to try to save JJ's Diner?
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more noble to go to war over than bacon and eggs.
Leslie Knope,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll keep practicing."
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.
Leslie Knope,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands."
JJ,That's not true.
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ."
Leslie Knope,"You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics."
Leslie Knope,"So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I do not like rallies.
Ron Swanson,"And based on what I see from this vantage point, I do not like most of you."
Ron Swanson,What I do like is breakfast food.
Ron Swanson,"JJ's has very good breakfast food, so it should remain open."
Ron Swanson,Please do not approach me on the street after this event and attempt to talk to me.
Ron Swanson,Our similarities begin and end with this single issue.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Extra,Can I help you?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,We are here to see Dennis Feinstein.
Andy Dwyer,The appointment should be under Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate.
Extra,"Um, I don't see a ""Jonathan Karate"" anywhere."
Andy Dwyer,Exactly.
Andy Dwyer,"Occasionally on my show, we deal with real issues like bullying, peer pressure, or holding in farts."
Andy Dwyer,"In those very special episodes, I become Jonathan Karate, the very serious older brother of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate tells it like it is.
Andy Dwyer,He makes people do the right thing.
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, baby."
Dennis Feinstein,That feels amazing.
Dennis Feinstein,"But I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go."
Dennis Feinstein,I have to meet Rick and TC at the King Kamehameha Club.
Dennis Feinstein,Higgins is missing.
Andy Dwyer,Dennis Feinstein.
Dennis Feinstein,What?
Dennis Feinstein,Who's that?
Andy Dwyer,My name is Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,We need to talk.
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, make it quick."
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go pull the plug on my dad in 10 minutes.
Andy Dwyer,I heard you were buying JJ's Diner and kicking everybody out.
Dennis Feinstein,That's true.
Dennis Feinstein,Real estate prices in this turd town are through the roof.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna turn that place into an elbow art salon and make a killing.
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?"
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now?
Dennis Feinstein,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,What do we want?
All,Breakfast!
Leslie Knope,When do we want it?
All,Forever!
Dennis Feinstein,I had no idea this place was so loved.
Dennis Feinstein,This could be bad for business.
Andy Dwyer,Then come with me.
Andy Dwyer,Tell the people that JJ's can stay.
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, you should get these kids out of here."
Dennis Feinstein,"Not to brag, but my colognes have been known to stunt human growth, soâ¦"
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas!
Andy Dwyer,Scatter.
Dennis Feinstein,You got 'em well trained.
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills
Extra,Donna.
Extra,Donna.
Extra,Donna.
Extra,"Can we get one right here, please?"
Extra,Right here.
Extra,Right here.
Extra,"Ladies and gentleman, off to our right, you can see the house that belongs to Bruce Willis and Christina Aguilera."
Extra,And to our left is Usher's Los Angeles residence.
Donna Meagle,Usher's house!
Tom Haverford,Usher's house!
Donna Meagle,Usher's star!
Tom Haverford,Usher's star!
Extra,"So, for the basic elbow bedazzling, it's 140."
Extra,Custom art starts at 250.
Donna Meagle,I would like three big-ass diamonds surrounded by their own set of tiny-ass diamonds.
Extra,"That would fall into our supreme collection, 600."
Donna Meagle,"Thomas, what do you suggest?"
Tom Haverford,Uh Treat yo' self.
Donna Meagle,"Trish, the gentleman is right."
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna go ahead and treat myself.
Tom Haverford,LASIK for fingernails?
Tom Haverford,I came up with that.
Extra,You want it?
Extra,It's 275.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Laser my nails off, please."
Leslie Knope,We can't bulldoze our entire history.
Leslie Knope,We need to preserve the things that make Pawnee great.
Leslie Knope,Like JJ's Diner.
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,Stop the clock.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, speak of the devil."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the devil, Dennis Feinstein."
Dennis Feinstein,Hey now.
Dennis Feinstein,Hang on.
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, Leslie, I think everybody's gonna wanna hear what I have to say."
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you.
Dennis Feinstein,"People of Pawnee, I just came down here to tell you how much I appreciate your passion."
Dennis Feinstein,You've been heard loud and clear.
Dennis Feinstein,You convinced me.
Dennis Feinstein,JJ's can stay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Dennis Feinstein,"I just have one more thing to say, Pawnee."
Dennis Feinstein,Psych!
Dennis Feinstein,Do you think I care about how much you love this stupid diner?
Dennis Feinstein,I bought it for a song and I'm gonna sell it for a mint and you can all just sit there pulling on your puds.
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, yeah."
Dennis Feinstein,Give me your boos!
Dennis Feinstein,I am nourished by your hatred!
Dennis Feinstein,"I should also let you know, you are all trespassing on private property."
Dennis Feinstein,Release the Hounds!
Ron Swanson,What hounds?
Dennis Feinstein,The Hounds is an FDA rejected cologne I've been working on that makes everything smell like wet dog.
Dennis Feinstein,Make it rain!
Dennis Feinstein,Ooh!
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go kill my dad.
Dennis Feinstein,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"I am sorry, JJ, that I gave you false hope."
Leslie Knope,"This is a lost cause, just like my stupid park."
Andy Dwyer,Screw that.
Andy Dwyer,There's gotta be another way.
Andy Dwyer,"What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office, film the whole thing."
Andy Dwyer,We'd definitely get on a prank show.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is."
April Ludgate,Does it have to stay where it is?
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting."
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,I'm in.
Leslie Knope,Anything to get away from this cologne smell.
Ben Wyatt,Ooh.
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Tom Haverford,This is the hottest restaurant in LA.
Tom Haverford,All the sushi is made from fish previously owned by celebrities.
Extra,"Okay, this is Charlize Theron's yellowtail, here we have Paul Reiser's salmon, and Peter Bogdanovich's saltwater eel."
Extra,Enjoy.
Donna Meagle,Mmm!
Donna Meagle,Bogdano delish.
Donna Meagle,"Man, you got it bad."
Donna Meagle,I know you're checking your phone every five minutes to see if Lucy will come with you to my wedding.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I understand."
Donna Meagle,Which is why I got you something.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're not supposed to get me anything."
Tom Haverford,This is your special day.
Donna Meagle,I didn't buy you anything.
Donna Meagle,What I have for you is a piece of advice.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, damn."
Tom Haverford,"I was secretly hoping you got me the shoes Jaden Smith wears in Hitch 2, Son of a Hitch."
Donna Meagle,"My advice to you is, if you want to be with Lucy, you have to be upfront with her about it."
Donna Meagle,Be a man and ask her out.
Tom Haverford,She works for me.
Tom Haverford,She uprooted her whole life to move to Pawnee for this job.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to make it weird.
Tom Haverford,And what if she says no?
Tom Haverford,What if I'm the only one that caught feelings?
Donna Meagle,You won't know until you ask.
Donna Meagle,"Basically, Tommy, when it comes to matters of the heart, I say, ""Treat yo' self."""
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna, it's a great gift."
Donna Meagle,I almost forgot.
Donna Meagle,I did get you them shoes from Hitch 2!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, snap!"
Tom Haverford,That's an even better gift!
Donna Meagle,That's not all.
Donna Meagle,"Look behind you, but don't be obvious."
Josh Groban,"Can I get the ""me"" soft shell crab?"
Tom Haverford,Josh Groban!
Tom Haverford,He's eating his own sushi!
Tom Haverford,That's the most baller thing I've ever seen!
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, broken down armpit of Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.
Ben Wyatt,Nothing's worked.
Ben Wyatt,"We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago, raccoons ate the wheels right off it."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace."
Leslie Knope,A more accurate name for this place?
Leslie Knope,Medical Waste Butt Sweat Grove.
Extra,"Hi, sorry I'm late."
Extra,We've had this listing for seven years and no one's ever asked to see it.
Extra,I thought this was a prank call.
April Ludgate,This place has everything.
April Ludgate,"Vermin, bullet holes, a hornet's nest."
JJ,"Look, I appreciate everything that you guys have done for me, but even if I put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap, it's not gonna change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore."
Andy Dwyer,Damn straight.
JJ,Everything would have to magically change.
JJ,"The whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean, and have businesses and people who dine out."
April Ludgate,"No, then we'd have to move again."
Leslie Knope,Are you thinkingâ¦
Ron Swanson,It's possible.
Leslie Knope,But how would we... PR.
Ron Swanson,PR.
Ron Swanson,Which you could thenâ¦
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Herman,I am.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Where'd you come from?
Herman,The floor hole.
Lucy,Hey!
Lucy,How was your trip?
Tom Haverford,"Great, obviously."
Tom Haverford,Bedazzled that elbow.
Lucy,How was everything here?
Lucy,Uneventful.
Lucy,"So, I was thinking about the idea of going to Donna's wedding."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, before you say anything."
Tom Haverford,I don't think you should go to Donna's wedding to supervise catering.
Lucy,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"I want you to come with me, as my date."
Lucy,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"The thing is, you work for me, so it's probably kind of uncool for me to even ask."
Tom Haverford,Which is why I signed these documents transferring day-to-day operations of Tom's Bistro over to Craig.
Tom Haverford,He'll be your boss now.
Tom Haverford,Not me.
Craig Middlebrooks,It's about time.
Craig Middlebrooks,"We're losing the cranberry salad, effective immediately!"
Lucy,You don't have to do this.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I do."
Tom Haverford,"You're great at your job, and I want you working here forever, and if you don't have feelings for me, I need you to know that everything is gonna be fine."
Tom Haverford,"In fact, forget it."
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even serious.
Tom Haverford,You've been hoaxed! You've been Tommy-ed!
Lucy,Just hold on.
Lucy,I was gonna say that I wouldn't wanna go with you as friends.
Lucy,I wanna go with you as your date.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,"Craig, never mind."
Tom Haverford,You can rip these papers up.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, I wish my reign had lasted longer, but I'm happy with the decisions I made and the people I fired."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,I'd better get back there.
Roscoe,"You guys, I don't know what this is about, but it's 4:13, so you got seven minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus."
Roscoe,Are you tripping? We just spent $125 million to build our new campus in the Southern Indiana Foothills.
Ron Swanson,"And you'll be spending another $100 million, at least, to construct the building, roads, plumbing, electrical."
Leslie Knope,"Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Here's a complete proposal for Gryzzl's new regional corporate headquarters.
Roscoe,Is this paper? Super throwback.
Ron Swanson,My company inspected all the buildings.
Ron Swanson,"They are disgusting, I grant you, but the guts are solid."
Ben Wyatt,"We've laid out construction costs, retail space options."
Ben Wyatt,"You could build a much bigger campus in this neighborhood, and basically break even."
April Ludgate,"Plus, the best part, all the buildings come pre-graffitied."
Roscoe,That's true.
Roscoe,We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.
Roscoe,"Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest."
Roscoe,So what are we supposed to do with that?
Leslie Knope,Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service?
Leslie Knope,That would be pretty dope.
Leslie Knope,And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't say these wordsâ¦
Ben Wyatt,You don't have toâ¦
Roscoe,"Okay, but why couldn't we just build the campus here, and then keep the land or sell it?"
Ron Swanson,You could.
Ron Swanson,But donating it will give you some good PR.
Ron Swanson,Which you desperately need.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city."
Leslie Knope,Show people that you're invested in this town.
Leslie Knope,"Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other."
Roscoe,"Okay, well, I gotta talk to my board, as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team."
Roscoe,"And truthfully, they're all shrooming super hard at Coachella right now."
Roscoe,"But as soon as they get back, I'll get into it."
Roscoe,"We gotta go, I'm sorry."
Roscoe,We got a meeting.
Andy Dwyer,I'll catch you guys later.
Andy Dwyer,I've got a meeting as well.
Andy Dwyer,See you back at the house.
Ben Wyatt,Andy has a meeting?
Dennis Feinstein,Upload it to my GryzzlGlass.
Dennis Feinstein,Left eye.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm watching porn with my right eye.
Dennis Feinstein,Who did this?
Andy Dwyer,We did.
Andy Dwyer,"One way or another, Jonathan Karate always gets his man."
Andy Dwyer,"And like that, they were gone."
Andy Dwyer,"Go! Wait, where's-- Hey, guys, where's Gavin? Gav? Wait, stop."
Andy Dwyer,There were supposed to be six ninjas.
Andy Dwyer,"Where's Gavin? Gavin? Who was Gavin's buddy? Caleb, come on, dude."
Andy Dwyer,Why do we even have a buddy system? Is he in the bathroom? You need to tell me if Gavin is pooping.
Andy Dwyer,"No, do not laugh, okay? You're not even Caleb."
Andy Dwyer,You're Gavin.
Andy Dwyer,You're Caleb.
Andy Dwyer,"If you're Caleb, where's Hunter? Hunter! Hunter! Okay, who was Hunter's buddy? Hmm? Oh, I was."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Dennis, what a mess."
Dennis Feinstein,You have 30 seconds to get out of this facility.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's been a week."
Leslie Knope,It might not work.
Ron Swanson,It'll work.
Leslie Knope,"But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no?"
Ron Swanson,Then you'll be secure in the knowledge that you gave it your best shot.
Ron Swanson,But I do really think they will go for it.
Leslie Knope,What makes you so confident?
Ron Swanson,"A wise woman once told me that whenever you and I team up, good things happen."
Ron Swanson,"Also, they called three hours ago, said they approved the plan, and asked me to begin drawings for the renovation."
Leslie Knope,You jerk.
Leslie Knope,You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Leslie Knope,You jerk! We did it! You jerk.
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Congratulations.
Ron Swanson,I do not approve of this.
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
