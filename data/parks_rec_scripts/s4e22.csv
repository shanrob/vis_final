Character,Line
Extra,I will certify the results after all the precints have reported.
Extra,A final tally within 1% would trigger an automatic recount.
Extra,"In the event of an exact tie, the seat is awarded to the male candidate, and the female candidate is put in jail."
Leslie Knope,"Once again, I have to object."
Extra,"I don't think it would hold up in court, but it is city law."
Extra,Any questions?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, actually."
Ben Wyatt,At the 11th hour the Newports are trying to install these voting machines at several precincts around town.
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when I vote for Bobby Newport.
Extra,Good choice.
Extra,Enjoy a voucher for a complimentary Sweetums candy bar.
Jennifer Barkley,Shouldn't we be rewarding our citizens for voting?
Leslie Knope,"I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me."
Extra,Are you sure?
Extra,Take a second and think it over.
Leslie Knope,Then you have to press it again.
Extra,"To cancel your vote and select someone better, press the Sweetums logo."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,I just don't see the problem.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor thin margin.
Leslie Knope,Could go either way.
Leslie Knope,"I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,This isn't a bagel.
Tom Haverford,Party starts at 7:00 in the historic Jermaine Jackson Ballroom at the Pawnee Supersuites.
Tom Haverford,"It is no longer ""A Pimps n' Hoes"" pajama party."
Tom Haverford,That idea was nixed by a certain uptight nerd who shall remain nameless.
Tom Haverford,"By 10:00, we should know if Leslie won the election, but more importantly, tonight, Ann and I are getting back together."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, right, because of the dream you had?"
Tom Haverford,Last night at approximately 2:30 A.M.
Tom Haverford,I woke up from a dream that felt so real that it had to be a premonition.
Tom Haverford,"Me, Drake, and the Tmobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet."
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins walks up to me, and she says, ""Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back."
Tom Haverford,""" Then Blue Ivy Carter highfived me and gave me $40 million."
Tom Haverford,It was all so real.
Leslie Knope,The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
Bobby Newport,That's right.
Bobby Newport,Another awesome point by Leslie.
Bobby Newport,That's why I'm voting for you.
Bobby Newport,What's so funny?
Leslie Knope,They're laughing at your joke.
Bobby Newport,What joke?
Bobby Newport,I am voting for you.
Leslie Knope,You're not voting for yourself?
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, you can't vote for yourself, I don't think."
Bobby Newport,I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Anything else?
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, you did an unbelievable job on this campaign, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,My partners back in Washington think so too.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie gets the credit."
Ben Wyatt,Not me.
Jennifer Barkley,Look.
Jennifer Barkley,"Your opponent is legendarily stupid and I phoned it in pretty hard, but you have a knack for this."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm running congressman Murray's reelection bid.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ohio, 19."
Jennifer Barkley,I need someone to coordinate out of D.C.
Jennifer Barkley,You want to do it?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that sounds great, but the Pacers called, and they're asking me to be their starting point guard."
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm being serious, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"What, you trust me with a congressional campaign?"
Ben Wyatt,Is this a trick?
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,This is a job offer.
Jennifer Barkley,Give me your answer soon.
Jennifer Barkley,I need you in Washington in two days.
Bobby Newport,Look at that thing.
Bobby Newport,What is that?
Leslie Knope,Don't touch it.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Can I ask your advice on something?
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Chris Traeger,"Recently in a moment of weakness, I had sex with Bobby Newport's campaign manager Jennifer Barkley."
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Several times.
Chris Traeger,And then several more times.
Chris Traeger,And then a couple more times.
Chris Traeger,And then one more time.
Ann Perkins,How long has this been going on?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, it was just last night."
Chris Traeger,"Now, I know it's a one night stand and that she's leaving town, but our ferocious sexual decathlon did radically improve my mood."
Chris Traeger,And I kind of like to see her again before she leaves.
Chris Traeger,Good idea?
Chris Traeger,Bad idea?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"I guess the campaign's over, so I suppose it couldn't hurt."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Got your message.
Andy Dwyer,Where are you?
April Ludgate,Under the table.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you hiding?
Andy Dwyer,Should I hide too?
Andy Dwyer,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"I was supposed to copy all the department files onto a thumb drive, and it kept freezing, and I got annoyed, and I don't know what happened, but all the files are gone on every computer."
April Ludgate,They're all gone.
April Ludgate,"Babe, they're all gone."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Andy Dwyer,Calm down.
Andy Dwyer,"First of all, you did the right thing by hiding under this table."
Andy Dwyer,"Secondly, your man is here."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take care of this for us.
Andy Dwyer,I've been playing Xbox for years.
Andy Dwyer,I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
Andy Dwyer,I know exactly what to do.
Andy Dwyer,Try it now.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Leslie Knope,What about my speeches?
Ben Wyatt,Finished both of them last night.
Ben Wyatt,"One if you win, one if you lose."
Leslie Knope,What if I tie?
Leslie Knope,"You need to write a tie speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, relax."
Ben Wyatt,We're done.
Ben Wyatt,All that's left is the waiting.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,What were you talking to Jen about?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I just yeah, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,She she's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,Nothing.
Ben Wyatt,It's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's a good place to buy jeans?"
Leslie Knope,You have plenty of jeans.
Leslie Knope,What were you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,Jen offered me a job working on a congressional campaign
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,In Washington.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you happy or angry?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""yes?"
Ben Wyatt,""" I haven't had a chance to think about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it sounds amazing, but you know, six months in Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Away from you, but you know, we should talk about it."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll just talk about it.
Leslie Knope,"You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side."
Leslie Knope,"Et cetera, et cetera."
Leslie Knope,"Just I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, I can't figure this thing out."
Bobby Newport,Can you help me?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby."
Bobby Newport,"Ink all over my hands, and the pen thingy came off the chain."
Bobby Newport,I don't get it!
Perd Hapley,"The polls have just closed, and now we're getting results in the race for city council."
Perd Hapley,"With just 1% of the precincts reporting, adult film star Brandi Maxxxx has a commanding lead."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's it.
Leslie Knope,"It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star."
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Italy?
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you're stressed out, and I figured you would be, so I took the liberty of arranging a fun little activity for us."
Leslie Knope,You did?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Another, Dana, please and thank you."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I handed out 1000 leaflets today."
Jerry Gergich,That is a personal best.
Jerry Gergich,Now I'm off to vote.
Ron Swanson,The polls are closed.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,I thought that they close at 8:00.
Ron Swanson,6
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I didn't get to vote for Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, what do I do?"
Ron Swanson,Nothing you can do.
Ron Swanson,Except hope Leslie doesn't lose by one vote.
Perd Hapley,and it's razor thin and getting razor thinner.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy."
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Chris Traeger,Jen Barkley.
Jennifer Barkley,Hey.
Jennifer Barkley,What are you doing here?
Jennifer Barkley,"That was fun last night, you old screamer."
Chris Traeger,There were moments that I didn't fully understand some of the physical shapes that we were making Mm.
Chris Traeger,But the sensations were amazing.
Chris Traeger,So I just went with it.
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I thought that we could just talk before you left town if that's okay."
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but there's a supply room over there with a futon."
Chris Traeger,Great.
Jennifer Barkley,Not yet.
Jennifer Barkley,Just wait we're just getting supplies.
Jennifer Barkley,Anybody need anything?
Jennifer Barkley,"Pushpins okay, good."
Andy Dwyer,Please hurry.
Andy Dwyer,I told her it's a matter of life and death.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, Donna's been here forever."
Andy Dwyer,She's going to know what to do.
April Ludgate,What if she doesn't?
April Ludgate,I could get fired.
April Ludgate,"Or even worse, Leslie might give me a lecture on responsibility again, I can't do it."
Andy Dwyer,"I'll tell you what, honey."
Andy Dwyer,Here's the deal.
Andy Dwyer,"You get fired, I'll quit."
Andy Dwyer,We'll leave together.
Andy Dwyer,I'm serious.
Andy Dwyer,Move to a new city.
Andy Dwyer,"Change our names, burn our fingertips off with acid, swap faces."
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,If we have to.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Nice.
Ann Perkins,Keep punching.
Leslie Knope,Did I hit your boob?
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Great form.
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Ann Perkins,I have no idea actually.
Ann Perkins,I don't know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,That was good.
Leslie Knope,I'm exhausted.
Leslie Knope,How long was that?
Ann Perkins,22 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, that's disappointing."
Ann Perkins,What are you going to do about Ben?
Leslie Knope,I just I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
Leslie Knope,We're just about to get our lives back.
Leslie Knope,It would kill me if he left.
Ann Perkins,Then tell him that.
Ann Perkins,Go find him and tell him how you feel.
Ann Perkins,And then the two of you could work it out together.
Leslie Knope,"Election results, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann, I can't read it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, my hands."
Leslie Knope,"My hands, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Here.
Leslie Knope,They're in these round gloves.
Ann Perkins,Here.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,20% of the precincts reporting.
Ann Perkins,Bobby Newport is up by 140 votes.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's get your hands back up.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go another eight seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm so tired."
Ben Wyatt,"Gin and tonic, please."
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Dana."
Ron Swanson,"Lagavulin, neat."
Ron Swanson,Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
Ron Swanson,"What's on your mind, son?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jen Barkley offered me a job in Washington."
Ben Wyatt,"A great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay."
Ben Wyatt,What would you do?
Ron Swanson,"Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana."
Ron Swanson,"I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991."
Ron Swanson,I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.
Ron Swanson,I have one bowl.
Ron Swanson,I still get my milk delivered by horse.
Ben Wyatt,You do?
Ron Swanson,But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.
Ron Swanson,You two have a good relationship.
Ron Swanson,"I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet."
Ben Wyatt,So you really want things to just stay exactly the same?
Ben Wyatt,"But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right?"
Ron Swanson,Seems that way.
Ben Wyatt,Then good luck to the both of us.
Ben Wyatt,Heyuh!
Ben Wyatt,Hmm!
Perd Hapley,I have an update that contains new information.
Perd Hapley,"With 74% of the precincts reporting, Leslie Knope is now winning by 192 votes."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank God."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, lord, please, please."
Jerry Gergich,Let her win.
Jerry Gergich,"Please, lord."
Jerry Gergich,"Please, lord, let her win."
Jerry Gergich,Please let her win.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to say this.
Leslie Knope,And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I know Ann."
Leslie Knope,I don't want you to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,"I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you."
Leslie Knope,Like normal people.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, then I won't go."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Easy.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I was on the fence about it anyway."
Ben Wyatt,"Washington's really far away, and I don't know if I want to work with Jen."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this just seals the deal."
Ben Wyatt,I'll stay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Ann Perkins,Guys.
Perd Hapley,"It's been neck in neck, too close to call all night, but now we're ready to make a call in the race for city council."
Perd Hapley,Bobby Newport
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Perd Hapley,Scion of the Sweetums candy empire and amateur gokart champion has won the race.
Ben Wyatt,Why are you laughing?
Leslie Knope,Because my dream is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, [Bleep]."
Ben Wyatt,Recount!
Ben Wyatt,There's a recount.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on."
Jennifer Barkley,It's over.
Jennifer Barkley,Just concede.
Ben Wyatt,Newport won by 21 votes.
Ben Wyatt,That's well within the margin for a recount.
Jennifer Barkley,Please don't do this.
Jennifer Barkley,I really want to get out of here.
Jennifer Barkley,How about this why don't I make you guys a deal?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly"
Jennifer Barkley,I'll give you Joe Biden's home phone number.
Leslie Knope,"Now, hang on."
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, you're not thinking clearly."
Ben Wyatt,Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Commissioner, the recount has to start immediately."
Ben Wyatt,It's the law.
Ben Wyatt,Now I'm not leaving until you make the call.
Extra,"He's right, Ms."
Extra,Barkley.
Extra,It'll start right away.
Extra,Keep your phones on.
Jennifer Barkley,Terrence!
Jennifer Barkley,I just want to go home.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, any news?"
Ben Wyatt,"They said the recount could take two hours, but who knows."
Tom Haverford,"Man, this is stressful."
Tom Haverford,I picked the wrong week to do a juice cleanse.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I think Leslie should say something to the troops just to get everyone's spirits up."
Ben Wyatt,Where is she?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,She's not answering her phone.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,No one knows where she is?
Ron Swanson,That's a nice chair.
Ron Swanson,"Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are handcut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak."
Leslie Knope,I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Leslie Knope,Figured this might be my last chance.
Ron Swanson,You don't know that.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard."
Leslie Knope,"Every five minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me."
Leslie Knope,"If I lose, I'll never forgive myself."
Leslie Knope,You deserve to win.
Ron Swanson,We didn't volunteer to help you because we wanted to wrap ourselves in personal glory.
Ron Swanson,We did it because we care about you.
Ron Swanson,"You had a dream, and we wanted to support your dream."
Ron Swanson,That's what you do when you care about someone.
Ron Swanson,"You support them, win, lose, or draw."
Ron Swanson,Let's go back to the party.
Ron Swanson,You drive.
Ron Swanson,I've had 11 whiskeys.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That's good on places to live.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go back to dream jobs.
Andy Dwyer,"If we had to start a new life, I have Detective, FBI agent, policeman, CIA agent."
Andy Dwyer,So we need more for you.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I"
Andy Dwyer,It's fun.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm trying to help you take your mind off of this horrible mistake you made deleting all these files, probably the worst thing to ever happen in Parks and Rec history."
Andy Dwyer,"You will certainly get fired, and I'm trying to help."
April Ludgate,God.
Andy Dwyer,"So dream jobs, go."
Andy Dwyer,"Dream big, kid!"
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"Uh, dental hygienist who's also a medium, so I can clean people's teeth and tell them when they're going to die."
Andy Dwyer,That's brilliant.
Donna Meagle,Let's make this fast.
Donna Meagle,I almost made it with Councilman Howser before you interrupted us.
Donna Meagle,Which files did you delete?
April Ludgate,All of them.
April Ludgate,"I just put the stupid flash drive in, and then I tried to drag everything over, and"
Donna Meagle,Fixed it.
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,How?
Donna Meagle,Jerry accidentally deletes things all the time.
Donna Meagle,"Ten years ago, I installed my own secret backup."
April Ludgate,"You saved us, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Oh.
April Ludgate,I love you.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,"Bring it in, boy."
Ben Wyatt,There you are.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to get the final results any minute.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Do you have both my speeches?
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,You seem calmer than I expected you'd be.
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,Let me open it for you.
Leslie Knope,You have to go to Washington.
Ben Wyatt,I told you I'm turning it down.
Leslie Knope,I was being selfish.
Leslie Knope,You put your whole life on hold for me.
Leslie Knope,The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure about this?
Leslie Knope,We can make it work.
Leslie Knope,"I will visit you, then you come visit me."
Leslie Knope,And then I go visit you again.
Leslie Knope,And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it all over Washington.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Where did you get a Washington Monument figurine at midnight on a Tuesday?
Leslie Knope,From my office.
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 50 of them."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ann Perkins,The recount's over.
Ann Perkins,They just called the race.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,It's still 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,But you won.
Ann Perkins,"You won, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You won by 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,It's confirmed.
Ann Perkins,It's over.
Ann Perkins,You won.
Leslie Knope,"That was really sneaky, Ann."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't resist.
Bobby Newport,"Honestly, I've never been more relieved in my entire life."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't ruin it.
Jerry Gergich,"I thought I ruined it, but I didn't ruin it."
Tom Haverford,You're kind of ruining it now.
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Jennifer Barkley,That is great news.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm going to see you in D.C.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I guess you will."
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, damn it."
Jennifer Barkley,Didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Chris.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, he's just right over there."
Jennifer Barkley,Eh.
Jennifer Barkley,He seems really busy.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, would you tell him I said good-bye? Great! Thank you."
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Jennifer Barkley,That doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm leaving.
Chris Traeger,"Congratulations, Mr."
Chris Traeger,Assistant City Manager.
Ron Swanson,"I'm very grateful, Chris, but I think I'm going to turn down the job."
Chris Traeger,Really? Why?
Ron Swanson,I like where I am.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh-oh, uh-oh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Did someone just talk about a job opening? Because guess who's got two thumbs and was just cleared from insurance fraud?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"This guy, you know? Got off on a technicality What's the gig? I'm in."
Chris Traeger,There's no job for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Smart move.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Go with your gut.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,All right? I'll talk to you guys soon.
Ben Wyatt,"Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me."
Ben Wyatt,I never wrote it.
Ann Perkins,And I know all of you know how hard she worked to get here.
Ann Perkins,"She is the next city councilwoman from the great city of Pawnee, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend in the world, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you."
Leslie Knope,I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
Leslie Knope,I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
Leslie Knope,And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
Leslie Knope,"And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are."
Leslie Knope,"I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters."
Leslie Knope,No one achieves anything alone.
Leslie Knope,So let's embark on a new journey together.
Leslie Knope,Let's break out a map.
Leslie Knope,"Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go."
Leslie Knope,Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Ann Perkins,"Tommy! This party was amazing, you're amazing."
Ann Perkins,"You are ridiculous, but I like you, and I think that we should date, all of it."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,Let's date.
Tom Haverford,This is my dream.
Tom Haverford,Nostra-Thomas is happening.
Ann Perkins,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, let's move in together."
Ann Perkins,Phhhht! Totally.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"All right, no take-backs when we sober up, little partner."
Ann Perkins,"No take-backs, partner."
Ann Perkins,We're cowboys.
Andy Dwyer,"Great win, great night."
Andy Dwyer,Great year.
Andy Dwyer,Hot wife.
Andy Dwyer,Jackpot.
Andy Dwyer,"Good job, me."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Babe.
April Ludgate,You know what? Almost everything you wrote on that board as a dream job was some type of police officer.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You ready to go?
April Ludgate,"No, listen to me."
Andy Dwyer,Mm-hmm.
April Ludgate,"How does this sound? ""Officer Dwyer, Pawnee PD."""
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings."
Leslie Knope,Nonnegotiable.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go! City council, bitches!"
Ron Swanson,Jerry forgot to vote.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
