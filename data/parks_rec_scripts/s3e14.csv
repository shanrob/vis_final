Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for that year over year maintenance cost analysis.
Ben Wyatt,That was really helpful.
Leslie Knope,You're so welcome.
Leslie Knope,I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
Leslie Knope,"Cause I was, um"
Ben Wyatt,'Cause I told you I wanted to read it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That's a good reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office."
Leslie Knope,I guess we should head over there.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, cool."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,See you there.
Leslie Knope,"I'll see you there, Benjamin."
Leslie Knope,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, ""Lesliemin."""
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents.
Leslie Knope,It can't happen.
Leslie Knope,We could both get fired.
Ann Perkins,That's a dumb rule.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you have to follow it, I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one, tensiony situations with him."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Good plan.
Chris Traeger,I am sending you two on a trip.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"The Indiana Little League Baseball Tournament is upon us, and Pawnee hasn't hosted it in 20 years."
Chris Traeger,"So, I would like you two to go to Indianapolis and state our case, because you two are my dynamic duo."
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Chris Traeger,Ah Ah And go team!
Ben Wyatt,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, everything you have is too sexy."
Leslie Knope,This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I look really good in it.
Leslie Knope,"I need, like, a sweat suit or something."
Leslie Knope,I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, this is insane."
Ann Perkins,It's so obvious you're dying to be together.
Ann Perkins,And now you're going on a road trip?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you guys could literally ""get a room."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I could literally get ""afired."""
Ann Perkins,"All right, I will help you antiseduce him."
Ann Perkins,Just tell me what else you need.
Leslie Knope,"I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car."
Leslie Knope,I have a few ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We could discuss The New Yorker article ""The History of the Ladder."""
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I have a good idea!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,Why don't you ask him about his penis?
April Ludgate,"Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking."
Tom Haverford,Okay!
Tom Haverford,Everyone stop what you're doing and come with me.
Tom Haverford,All four of you.
Ron Swanson,Where are you going?
Tom Haverford,Leslie's not here today.
Tom Haverford,No boss.
Tom Haverford,We can do whatever we want.
Ron Swanson,I'm your boss.
Tom Haverford,"That's a good one, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Seriously.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Here's the sitch.
Tom Haverford,"I developed a dope new game show where I ask couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other one answered."
Tom Haverford,I call this Know Ya Boo.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that sounds like The Newlywed Game."
Tom Haverford,"Shut up, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,"It's not The Newlywed Game, okay?"
Tom Haverford,It is totally The Newlywed Game.
Tom Haverford,But big deal.
Tom Haverford,Everyone steals.
Tom Haverford,"My favorite movie is Love Don't Cost a Thing, with Nick Cannon, which is based on Can't Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs. Kramer or something, which I think was Shakespeare."
Tom Haverford,"Don't know, don't care."
April Ludgate,And what exactly do you plan on doing with this game show idea?
April Ludgate,Are you going to shove it up your butt?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna test it out on you four bingbongs and work out the kinks, then hire actual attractive people, and make a demo."
Donna Meagle,What network is gonna buy a game show from you?
Tom Haverford,"There's a million networks out there, and they all need programming."
Tom Haverford,"Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse, WOW, Boom, Zip, Kablam, Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD."
Andy Dwyer,I love Slurp HD.
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Ultimate Battle Smoothie?
Tom Haverford,That's a dope show.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy."
Ben Wyatt,Did you go to Johns Hopkins?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,Do you wanna play some music?
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Ann Perkins,"Jimmy Carter's ""Crisis of Confidence"" speech, Learning to Speak Mandarin, 16 minutes of Old Timey Car Horn, and something called Banjo Boogie Bonanza."
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing instrument, the banjo."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize it could be this loud.
Lauren,Hello?
Lauren,Hello?
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Lauren,Hi.
Lauren,"My class is here on a field trip, and I'm supposed to interview someone for a school project."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"You can wait at that table, and someone will be here sometime."
Lauren,But aren't you here now?
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"It's time to know your I don't have the instrumental backing track yet, but it's gonna say ""boo"" right there."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,Welcome to Know Ya Boo.
Tom Haverford,"I'm your host, Tom Haverford, and with me as always is my CGI puppy cohost, Bobby the Boo!"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's get to it."
Tom Haverford,First question.
Tom Haverford,"Fellas, which rock star would your lady bang if she could bang one rock star?"
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,"I believe I have heard Donna talk about Prince, a lot."
Tom Haverford,What'd your boo say?
Tom Haverford,Impressive!
Tom Haverford,"All right, Andy, which rock star would your lady get with?"
Andy Dwyer,"Um, this is almost too easy."
Andy Dwyer,Me!
Tom Haverford,Let's check in with your boo!
Andy Dwyer,Yay!
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Who is Jeff Mangum?
April Ludgate,The guy from Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
April Ludgate,That's my favorite band.
April Ludgate,"I've told you that, like, a thousand times."
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember.
Andy Dwyer,Why wouldn't you pick me?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,You're not technically a rock star.
Tom Haverford,Booyah!
Tom Haverford,Somebody don't know their boo!
Tom Haverford,That's the sound bite that's gonna play when a fight breaks out.
Ron Swanson,"Look, little girl, can we postpone this for another day?"
Ron Swanson,It's unsettling having you just sit there.
Lauren,But my report's due tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,What's it on?
Lauren,Why government matters.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,"It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore, chapped nipples."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.
Ron Swanson,"What's your name, ma'am?"
Lauren,Lauren Burkiss.
Ron Swanson,"Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson, and I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know about the miserable, screwedup world of local government."
Lauren,You have mustard in your mustache.
Ron Swanson,"Don't sass me, Burkiss."
Ron Swanson,Let's get started.
Ron Swanson,"""Life, liberty, and property."""
Ron Swanson,That's John Locke.
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Whale sounds.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You can change it if you want.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,This is such a great song.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I snuck an Al Green song in there."
Ann Perkins,I want them to get together.
Ann Perkins,Sue me.
Leslie Knope,Did you see this?
Leslie Knope,"According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,It's a silly rule.
Ben Wyatt,But maybe they'll be reasonable and not care.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits."
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa?
Ben Wyatt,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,They have the softest towels.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I gotta tell you."
Ben Wyatt,I love a nice towel in my life.
Leslie Knope,Me too.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's the simplest luxury, but it makes all the difference."
Leslie Knope,Their bath mats are amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's like stepping on a lamb.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, come here."
Ben Wyatt,You've got an eyelash on your face.
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,Make a wish.
Extra,Learning to speak Mandarin.
Extra,Unit three.
Leslie Knope,Get away from me.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm allergic to fingers.
Extra,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Extra,This is my little brother.
Extra,Next up.
Extra,"The delegation from Pawnee, please?"
Leslie Knope,"And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen."
Extra,I have to bring up what happened the last time Pawnee hosted this tournament.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Perd Hapley,Good evening.
Perd Hapley,We begin with our first story tonight.
Perd Hapley,"They're cute, they're cuddly, but now they're wreaking havoc at the State Little League Championship."
Perd Hapley,Pawnee's raccoon infestation.
Perd Hapley,Have these little bandits stolen our sense of safety?
Leslie Knope,The raccoon problem is under control.
Leslie Knope,"They have their part of the town, and we have ours."
Extra,Muncie is larger.
Extra,Bloomington is more central.
Extra,What's the advantage of doing it in Pawnee?
Ben Wyatt,The advantage is that it's a wonderful city.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, I've been to fourty some odd towns in Indiana and Pawnee is special."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the people are passionate and kind."
Ben Wyatt,They love their city.
Ben Wyatt,They take pride in their work.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a very, very special place."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, it's Tom Haverford back here with Know Ya Boo."
Tom Haverford,Let's move to the next question.
Tom Haverford,Where is your favorite place to smush your boo?
Tom Haverford,Donna!
Donna Meagle,Back of my Benz?
Tom Haverford,Let's check in with your boo!
Tom Haverford,"He said, ""Her Mercedes""!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry and Donna on fire.
Tom Haverford,April?
April Ludgate,This question is gross.
Tom Haverford,That's kind of the point.
Tom Haverford,What's your answer?
April Ludgate,"In our bed, I guess."
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Where's your boo's favorite place to smush?
Andy Dwyer,At the Neutral Milk Hotel.
April Ludgate,Get over it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you get over it."
Andy Dwyer,You like some other dude's band more than me.
Andy Dwyer,Do you even think Mouse Rat is the greatest band in the world?
Andy Dwyer,'Cause it's starting to not feel that way.
April Ludgate,That band is really important to me.
April Ludgate,"And, honestly, I've asked you to listen to them, like, a million times, and you never have, so"
Andy Dwyer,"'Cause their music is sad, and depressing, and weird."
Andy Dwyer,"And art is supposed to be happy and fun, and everyone knows that."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,Forget it.
April Ludgate,"Fine, forget it."
Tom Haverford,Damn!
Tom Haverford,This game's got juice.
Ron Swanson,This is your lunch.
Ron Swanson,"Now, you should be able to do whatever you want to with this, right?"
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna eat all of it, great."
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna throw it away in the garbage, that's your prerogative."
Ron Swanson,"But here I come, the government, and I get to take 40% of your lunch. And that, Lauren, is how taxes work."
Lauren,But that's not fair.
Ron Swanson,You're learning.
Ron Swanson,Uhoh.
Ron Swanson,Capital gains tax.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Chris says congratulations and that together we're unstoppable."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, cheers, sir!"
Ben Wyatt,Yup.
Leslie Knope,You did it.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you did it."
Leslie Knope,"No, normally I do it."
Leslie Knope,"This time, you did it."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Leslie Knope,You should take the praise.
Extra,Can I get a shot of you guys?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, when this thing's over, do you wanna grab some dinner?"
Ben Wyatt,Chris recommended a place.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer."
Leslie Knope,You want in?
Leslie Knope,You wanna grab some grub?
Extra,"Uh, no, thanks."
Leslie Knope,They have great burgers.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you don't even know where we're going yet."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure they have great burgers there, though."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, photographer."
Leslie Knope,Last chance.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then, it's just us then."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I tried.
Ron Swanson,"And that, Lauren, is how FDR ruined this country."
Extra,"Lauren, ready to head back?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess it's time for you to head home."
Ron Swanson,I've really enjoyed talking with you.
Ron Swanson,"You are, and this is not a joke, much smarter than most of the people who work in this building."
Lauren,"I liked talking with you, too, Mr. Swanson."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Hang on, hang on, I have something for you."
Ron Swanson,This is a Claymore land mine.
Ron Swanson,Use that to protect your property.
Lauren,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Tom Haverford,"Tommy Hilfiger iPhone app, finally."
April Ludgate,"Hey, your stupid Know Your Boo game made me and Andy get in a big fight."
April Ludgate,"He just sold his guitar, and he's, like, quitting music now."
Tom Haverford,What do you want me to do about it?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, welcome to the super awesome bonus lightning round."
Tom Haverford,First question.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, who did your boo say makes the best mac and cheese in the universe?"
Andy Dwyer,The universe?
Andy Dwyer,Kraft?
Tom Haverford,April said Andy.
Tom Haverford,Best couple ever.
Tom Haverford,You just won 50 points.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why?"
Andy Dwyer,We got it wrong.
Tom Haverford,Next lightning round thing.
Tom Haverford,Who is the number one Colts fan in the world?
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,You set this whole thing up so I would be unmad at you.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, guess what, ain't gonna work."
Tom Haverford,You figured out April's trying to trick you.
Tom Haverford,That's worth 100 points.
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Goodbye.
Leslie Knope,You were really great in that presentation today.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thanks."
Leslie Knope,I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,That was really nice to hear.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Pawnee is a really special town."
Ben Wyatt,I love living there.
Ben Wyatt,And... And I look forward to the moments in my day where I... Where I get to hang out with the town and talk to the town about stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"And the town has really nice blond hair, too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"And I know we can get into trouble, but I can't take this anymore, and I feel like we have to at least talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's not just me, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not just you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you Are you all right?
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,I'm not buying cocaine.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,"The whiz palace, as I like to call it."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's not really code if you say his name."
Leslie Knope,"He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now."
Leslie Knope,On his face.
Ann Perkins,That's awesome!
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Read me the script.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"""Leslie, it's Leslie Knope from the Parks Department speaking to you through Ann Perkins, friend and beautiful nurse."""
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"""Do not do anything with Ben."""
Ann Perkins,"""Be responsible, no matter how cute his mouth is."""
Ann Perkins,"""Your job is on the line!"""
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann!"
Ann Perkins,You wrote that.
Leslie Knope,"No, you-- Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome."
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"No, you're supposed to talk me out of this."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Don't.
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway."
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"When Ben told me that you had won the bid, I was wildly ecstatic, and I had to come up here and celebrate with you."
Chris Traeger,There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.
Chris Traeger,"So, what's the plan now?"
Chris Traeger,Should we take a long walk?
Chris Traeger,Minigolf.
Ben Wyatt,I'll probably Shouldn't we just go back to Pawnee?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,There's no reason to drive all the way back home.
Chris Traeger,I've got a perfectly good condo right here in the city.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we couldn't put you out like that."
Chris Traeger,Double nonsense.
Chris Traeger,I would love to have you stay with me.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you can take the guest room, and, Ben, you have to sleep on my couch."
Chris Traeger,It is literally the comfiest couch you've ever been on.
Ben Wyatt,This is weird.
Leslie Knope,We're on Chris' couch.
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, we are."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm wearing his clothes.
Leslie Knope,Well Well
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, I keep myself very well hydrated, and my bladder is the size of a thimble."
Chris Traeger,I urinate roughly 12 times a night.
Leslie Knope,"I think I might go to bed, too, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah? Okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look Good job, again, today."
Ben Wyatt,It was
Leslie Knope,"You, too."
Ben Wyatt,Really? Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that was quick and to the point."
Chris Traeger,Here's a tip.
Chris Traeger,"The key to a healthy urethra, radishes."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I'm gonna go to bed."
Chris Traeger,Good night.
Leslie Knope,Good night.
Chris Traeger,"Well, now I'm up."
Chris Traeger,You wanna Boggle?
Lauren's Mom,Are you Ron Swanson?
Ron Swanson,I am.
Lauren's Mom,"Okay, what exactly did you teach my daughter?"
Ron Swanson,You must be Mrs. Burkiss.
Lauren's Mom,Lauren was supposed to do a paper on why government matters.
Lauren's Mom,This is what she wrote.
Ron Swanson,"""It doesn't."""
Ron Swanson,Well said.
Lauren's Mom,Is this a joke?
Ron Swanson,"No, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,I legitimately believe that.
Ron Swanson,I'm a libertarian.
Lauren's Mom,"Oh, that's nice."
Lauren's Mom,"Well, she is a fourth grader."
Lauren's Mom,And fourth graders aren't supposed to have their heads crammed full of weird ideas.
Lauren's Mom,They're supposed to do cute reports and get gold stars.
Ron Swanson,I'm very sorry.
Ron Swanson,I was only
Lauren's Mom,And you ate her lunch?
Lauren's Mom,And you gave her a land mine? Really?
Ron Swanson,"Well, it seemed appropriate at the time."
Lauren's Mom,I How?
Ann Perkins,"You know this is my house, right?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, hi."
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna come in? You okay?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Andy is totally mad at me right now, and I don't know how to deal with him."
April Ludgate,So I thought I would ask you.
Ann Perkins,"You know, Andy and I broke up so long ago."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that I'd be the best source to Please.
Ann Perkins,What happened?
April Ludgate,He doesn't think I like Mouse Rat.
April Ludgate,"All I said to him was that this other band was better, but I don't know why he got all mad, because it's like an indisputable fact that they're better."
April Ludgate,They're a real band.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, Andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music."
Ann Perkins,"So, this isn't really about being right."
Ann Perkins,It's more about being supportive.
April Ludgate,"Oh, wow."
April Ludgate,"I didn't realize you were a marriage counselor, Ann."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,My instinct is to be mean to you.
Ann Perkins,I understand.
Chris Traeger,O-M-G.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I read that same article."
Chris Traeger,"""The History of the Ladder."""
Chris Traeger,It's utterly fascinating.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, you're gonna love this."
Chris Traeger,"Really? Do you know that the original image of a ladder is in a cave in Valencia, Spain, drawn over 10,000 years ago."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,How about some music?
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,What is this?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I love this song."
April Ludgate,The pit
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,You were in the pit We all were in the pit The pit I was in the pit You were in the pit We all were in the pit
Andy Dwyer,What is this?
April Ludgate,Living out my dream.
April Ludgate,Playing a show with the greatest band ever.
Andy Dwyer,That's my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,You bought it back from Sewage Joe?
April Ludgate,"I actually stole it from his office, but whatever."
April Ludgate,He's a weirdo.
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe April doesn't think that we're the greatest band in the world, but, man, she loves me."
Andy Dwyer,And I love her.
Andy Dwyer,"So, you know, who cares."
Andy Dwyer,I got the greatest wife in the world!
April Ludgate,Stop.
Andy Dwyer,We're married! We're totally gonna do it later!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly."
Leslie Knope,"I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, he's not here."
Ben Wyatt,He took off.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Uh-oh.
Ron Swanson,"All I'm saying is, keep an open mind for a while."
Ron Swanson,Listen to your teachers and read all the books you can.
Ron Swanson,"Then when you're 18, you can drink, gamble and become a libertarian."
Lauren,The drinking age is 21.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,Another stupid government rule.
Ron Swanson,So you'll write a new paper?
Lauren,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Can you autograph this one for me?
Lauren,Sure.
