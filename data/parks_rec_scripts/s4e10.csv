Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, is that a new jogging shirt?"
Chris Traeger,It is!
Chris Traeger,It's an experimental fabric called bumbleflex.
Chris Traeger,It's made out of synthetic bees' wings.
Leslie Knope,That's cool.
Chris Traeger,Anyway You're not supposed to be here.
Chris Traeger,You're suspended.
Leslie Knope,I totally understand that.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just going to, uh, take my flash drive and I'll do some work from home."
Chris Traeger,N O.
Chris Traeger,You are specifically prohibited from doing your job.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm not gonna do my job."

Chris Traeger,Leslie.
Chris Traeger,Go home and give me the flash drive.

Chris Traeger,I am much faster than you!
Chris Traeger,I have bumbleflex!
Leslie Knope,It's so nice to be able to sit here in public and have breakfast with you.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I feel the same way about resigning in disgrace."
Leslie Knope,"Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at me, look how busy I am."
Leslie Knope,"I'm inventing a new spice called ""salgar."""
Leslie Knope,"It's part salt, part sugar."
Ben Wyatt,What could that possibly be good on?
Leslie Knope,Butterscotch pudding.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers."
Leslie Knope,"You have a big day, right?"
Leslie Knope,Which interview is this?
Ben Wyatt,"It's a job doing inhouse accounting work for an accounting firm, so could be pretty interesting."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, sounds interesting."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if I hadn't resigned in disgrace, I might never have explored the private sector."
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, why didn't I resign in disgrace 12 years ago?"
Leslie Knope,"You might want to stop saying ""resigned in disgrace."""
Leslie Knope,Especially during job interviews.
Ben Wyatt,Good call.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie wishes she could be here herself to give you these presents, but she's suspended."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and also she said that they're not from her, they're from Santa Claus."
Andy Dwyer,Can I go first?
Andy Dwyer,"Mouse Rat, certified gold!"
Andy Dwyer,Over 100 copies sold in Pawnee!
Andy Dwyer,I need to get a picture of me holding this so I can frame it.
Donna Meagle,"Personalized, leopardprinted robe."
Donna Meagle,Pink feather cuffs.
Donna Meagle,"And on the back, in rhinestones ""You can get it""!"
Tom Haverford,"I know you're sad you couldn't get tickets to the ""Watch the Throne"" tour, so I got you a watch and a tiny throne instead."
Tom Haverford,"And check it out, she even took out the dumb clock part and put this in ""Baller Time."""
April Ludgate,These are the Blackeyed Peas.
April Ludgate,And I finally killed them.
April Ludgate,It's a Christmas miracle.
Ron Swanson,"Every year, I give Leslie the same present I give everyone: A crisp $20 bill."
Ron Swanson,"And every year, she gets me something thoughtful and personal."
Ron Swanson,It makes me furious.
Ron Swanson,"This year, she outdid herself."
Ron Swanson,She had it installed over the weekend.
Ron Swanson,It's so It's so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift giving imbalance.
Ron Swanson,Everyone start thinking of ideas.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,Socks.
Jerry Gergich,She gets me.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, hi, hi, hi."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,I was off getting holiday gifts for my team.
Leslie Knope,"William, here is a Knope 2012 tree ornament."
William Barnes,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 Menorah Maybe?"
Elizabeth Barnes,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I got you a tree ornament.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's talk about damage control."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but and I know this is a long shot Oprah has her own network now."
Elizabeth Barnes,"Whoa, Leslie, slow down."
William Barnes,"The first step is for us to figure out what we're up against, and we've already got polls out in the field, and we should have results back in a couple of days."
William Barnes,"Just stay out of the spotlight until we can figure out just how this, uh, incident has affected the voters."
Elizabeth Barnes,"Sit tight, take a beat, relax."
Leslie Knope,"""Sit tight""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Take a beat""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Relax""?"
Leslie Knope,I don't really do any of those things.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head."
Leslie Knope,Strawberry margaritas!
Leslie Knope,Another use for salgar!
Barney,"Financial analysis, automated general ledger accounting systems, audit management."
Barney,"Hmm, you've done everything."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they call me ""the Swiss Army Accountant."""
Ben Wyatt,They don't call me that.
Barney,They should.
Barney,"Well, look, I think you'd be a great addition."
Barney,Would you be willing to come back to meet the division head?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, absolutely."
Barney,We'll set that up.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh Calc you later."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you like that one, huh?"
Barney,"We do not get a lot of humor here, and when we do, it's wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Barney,Ted!
Barney,Come in here!
Barney,Say it to Ted when he comes in.
April Ludgate,We could get Leslie some marshmallow fluff.
April Ludgate,I have some right here.
Andy Dwyer,"Correction, darling."
Andy Dwyer,You had some right here.
April Ludgate,Did you just scoop it out of the jar with your hand like a bear?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,I can't get it off.
Andy Dwyer,Can you help me?
Tom Haverford,Behold!
Tom Haverford,My latest attempt to drag this department into the 20th century.
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, it's the 21st century."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.
Tom Haverford,"I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated A word cloud."
Tom Haverford,This is how we can get gift ideas.
Tom Haverford,"The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears."
Ron Swanson,"""Ben"" And much larger, ""Ann."""
Ron Swanson,She definitely loves Ann.
Ann Perkins,Aww.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I have an idea.
Ron Swanson,I will build a small wood model of the parks department.
Ron Swanson,We can decorate our offices as they are in real life.
Ron Swanson,It will be Cute.
Ann Perkins,Wait!
Ann Perkins,Better idea: We make a gingerbread version of the office.
Andy Dwyer,That's so good!
Ron Swanson,I think the wood model is best
Ann Perkins,and we can decorate our offices with candy canes and gumdrops!
Jerry Gergich,That would be so adorable!
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron!"
Ann Perkins,That's such a cute idea!
Ron Swanson,I have some great red birch with a nice spalting.
Ron Swanson,I already have some scale wainscoting.
Ben Wyatt,"Mmm, I love me a calzone."
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,I'm going crazy!
Leslie Knope,"First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either."
Leslie Knope,"All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that!"
Ben Wyatt,You're putting an awful lot of salgar on your pasta.
Leslie Knope,This is just sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need you to distract me."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about something.
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that accounting firm is gonna make me a job offer."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna take it?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it pays well."
Ben Wyatt,"The commute is a little long, but that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't love the carpeting, but eh."
Leslie Knope,You know what I think?
Leslie Knope,"If you don't love it, take a month."
Leslie Knope,See what else is out there.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"And, you know, you can still improve the city."
Ben Wyatt,"You can't work right now, or run a campaign."
Ben Wyatt,Do it as a private citizen.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for dinner, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"I can hear you breathing, and, yes, you can finish her pasta."
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so hungry.
Andy Dwyer,"Mmm, it tastes like froot loops."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Great turn out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP."
Extra,"Um, should we really be called ""PCP""?"
Leslie Knope,"See, because Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast acting and powerful, we should be illegal."
Leslie Knope,"Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks?"
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,I've noticed that the White Hills hiking path could really use some upkeep.
Extra,I was thinking we organize a letterwriting campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, II know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but she isn't currently there, because he was suspended."
Extra,How amazing can he be if he got suspended?
Leslie Knope,"Pretty damn amazing, Diane."
Leslie Knope,Now shush.
Leslie Knope,"If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose."
Ann Perkins,"Ron is making the model, and then we're going to put all of our candy decorations in our corners of the office."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what did everybody make?"
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Rock n' roll candy Andy.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"That's really good, son."
Ron Swanson,I didn't do anything for my office.
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I took care of it."
April Ludgate,I made a marshmallow Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,His arms are crossed because he's mad at all the other marshmallow workers for annoying him.
April Ludgate,You like it?
Ron Swanson,It's fine.
Tom Haverford,"When I was trying to decide how to decorate my office, I had to ask myself, ""what kind of candy should I choose?"""
Tom Haverford,"Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me."
Tom Haverford,"Now the question still remained, ""what kind of chocolate am I?"""
Tom Haverford,"Do I have a little gooey, caramel center?"
Tom Haverford,Am I filled with little rice krispies?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, just put your damn candy out."
Tom Haverford,"Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge."
Tom Haverford,"I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce."
Donna Meagle,So I made my desk out of silver m&ms.
Donna Meagle,"But they do not make silver m&ms, so I spraypainted them."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, those are poisonous, so no one eat them."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, duh."
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't eat any.
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
April Ludgate,Throw up.

Dennis Feinstein,This cologne company is my life's work.
Dennis Feinstein,Why should I trust you with my perfumery?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh, I've been in government accounting for more than a decade, and I just think it's time for a change."
Dennis Feinstein,"Listen, Ben, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay?"
Dennis Feinstein,I like you I've always liked you but I also like Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,Ed who who's Eddie?
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie's my current CFO, but I might fire him and hire you."
Dennis Feinstein,You got kids?

Dennis Feinstein,That's good.
Dennis Feinstein,Dumdum Eddie has two kids.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Don't fire Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you have him in here in this interview?
Ben Wyatt,"Eddie, I am sorry"
Dennis Feinstein,Don't talk to Eddie.
Dennis Feinstein,"Treat him like you would treat a person in another country that you paid $25,000 to hunt."
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Dennis Feinstein,What am I talking about?
Dennis Feinstein,I'm talking about the best vacation of my life.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sorry."

Ben Wyatt,Keep Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,I do not want this job.
Dennis Feinstein,"You're crazy, man."

Jerry Gergich,"Okay, are there any more recommendations for new games at the rec center?"
Extra,"My daughter, she loves chutes and ladders."
Chance Frenlm,"Oh, come on!"

Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP."
Leslie Knope,We have a list of six demands.
Leslie Knope,Here they are in alphabetical order.
Leslie Knope,Number one: Ants.
Leslie Knope,Too many ants in the teen center.
Leslie Knope,Number two: Tennis court improvements.
Leslie Knope,Number three
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Les-- um, ma'am, uh, this public forum, it is just about improvements that we can make to the rec center."
Leslie Knope,"Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking."
Leslie Knope,Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
Leslie Knope,We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Extras,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going."
Leslie Knope,"Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger."
Leslie Knope,I want to take this fight to him.
Extra,"Ooh, a letterwriting campaign!"
Leslie Knope,"God, Diane, will you stop it with the letterwriting campaign?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have his office number.
Leslie Knope,I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a fivemile radius of the city center."
Leslie Knope,But there are only 12 of us.
Extra,13
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,Our numbers are growing!
Leslie Knope,"There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives."
Leslie Knope,You with me?
Ron Swanson,"I can handcraft 17 foot canoes out of western red cedar, but I can't glue two damn Graham crackers together!"
Andy Dwyer,"Look, it's really easy."
Andy Dwyer,I know a lot about candy.
Andy Dwyer,"I play with it, I eat it."
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes I play with it and eat it.
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ron Swanson,"Okay, new plan."
Ron Swanson,"Everyone else makes this candy house, and I make myself useful elsewhere."
Extra,Your 11:00 is here.
Leslie Knope,Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,You're not supposed to be here.
Leslie Knope,"As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,Those are the people that have been harassing me.
Leslie Knope,We have many demands.
Leslie Knope,"Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately."
Chris Traeger,Well
Leslie Knope,Not good enough!
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, out of respect for you, I will meet with your group, but I hope that this puts an end to the madness."
Leslie Knope,Prepare for battle.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present."
Leslie Knope,It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Chris Traeger,Ahh!
Chris Traeger,That is so thoughtful!
Leslie Knope,Aww.
Leslie Knope,My pleasure.
Leslie Knope,See you in hell!
William Barnes,"Well, I see you've taken our advice about relaxing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together."
Leslie Knope,"But enough about me, what are my polling results?"
William Barnes,"Uh, well, before the scandal, you were at 26%."
William Barnes,"Now, we knew we'd take a hit, but we figured as long as we're at 15% or above, we're still in the fight."
Leslie Knope,And we're at 15%?
Leslie Knope,We went back to 26%?
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,50%?
Elizabeth Barnes,We're at one.
Leslie Knope,One hundred?
William Barnes,You're polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That can't be right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this."
Leslie Knope,How do we put a positive spin on this?
Elizabeth Barnes,There's no way to spin this.
Leslie Knope,Sure there is.
Leslie Knope,You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing?"
William Barnes,It's very hard to come back from this kind of thing.
William Barnes,"You know, a sex scandal with your boss."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like you're so pure and chaste."
Leslie Knope,"Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together."
Leslie Knope,"It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles."
Elizabeth Barnes,I'm gay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, never mind then."
William Barnes,It's a small town.
William Barnes,There's nowhere to hide.
William Barnes,We can't run your campaign anymore.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
William Barnes,"You were a great candidate, butit's over."
Ann Perkins,Could you maybe find new advisors?
Leslie Knope,I can't.
Leslie Knope,I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Nobody wants a candidate who's polling at ""last milkshake sip"" levels."
Ann Perkins,Can I say something?
Ann Perkins,"This sucks, I am not gonna convince you that it doesn't, and you can tell me every day for the next year about how much this sucks."
Leslie Knope,One year you said one year.
Leslie Knope,That's on the record.
Ann Perkins,And I meant it.
Ann Perkins,But eventually this'll pass.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get through this.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Don't touch my pickles, Ann!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,BbbbBenjammin'!

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"By the way, there's a woman over there that is unbelievable."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Her name is Kim.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When she rips it off, she smiles, and it makes you feel things."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Throw my name, I get a referral discount."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,If you don't mind.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I heard somebody resigned in disgrace.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"My question to you is, how you making that paper?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I've interviewed around, uh, but I'm actually about to take a job doing in-house accounting for an accounting firm."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I almost fell asleep during that sentence.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me get this straight.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You would be an accountant For accountants?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"So at this accounting firm, you would have the boring job? Are you nuts? This is probably the first time you've had off since you've been kid president."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,True or false?
Ben Wyatt,True.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Why don't you use that time and go after one of your passions, like model trains or, like, or toy Gandalfs or something?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know why you jumped straight to model trains.
Ben Wyatt,I mean it's accurate.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna tell you something that I once heard from a very, very smart woman named Kim."
Ben Wyatt,The lady who waxes you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"She told me, ""if you don't love what you do Then why do it?"" Then she ripped the hair from my b-hole."
Chris Traeger,"Ron filled me in on everything that happened, and I really wish that the ethics investigation hadn't interfered with your campaign in any way."
Leslie Knope,You don't have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,You were very fair.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize."
Leslie Knope,I got you involved in PCP.
Leslie Knope,"But I'm starting a new group now, LSD, Leslie's Sorry Division, and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, that's nice of you to say."
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, now, for your Christmas present."
Chris Traeger,Your suspension's been lifted.
Chris Traeger,"Please, come back to work."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing here?"

Ann Perkins,"Merry Christmas, Leslie!"

Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I love it! Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically."
Leslie Knope,And all of you! You did all of this together?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, except for me."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out, I cannot make a gingerbread house, which would bother me if I were an 8-year-old girl."
Ron Swanson,"In any case, these people stepped up and helped me out, and that gave me another idea."
Ron Swanson,"This is the city council chambers, and that's you, next may."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Ann Perkins,"Your campaign advisers quit, big deal."
Ann Perkins,"You're running for city council again, Leslie, with our help."
April Ludgate,"April Ludgate, youth outreach and director of new media."

Barney,"Um, the, uh, temp agency said that you are fluent with Quickbooks Pro, correct?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, right, yeah, we should cover that."
