Leslie Knope,"Well, the honeymoon was amazing."
Leslie Knope,We saw the bus stop where a young Barack Obama used to sit and wait for the bus.
Leslie Knope,Theoretically.
Ben Wyatt,It's possible.
Leslie Knope,Then we went and visited Honolulu City Hall.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,You know.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, what was it like?"
Leslie Knope,It was amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, bummer."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have presents!"
Leslie Knope,"Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood."
Chris Traeger,And a super gift.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, ""I like my coffee like I like my men."
Leslie Knope,"Dark, rich, and full bodied."""
Donna Meagle,"Yes, indeed."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby."
Ann Perkins,That's so nice.
Ann Perkins,Where'd you find that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna throw it away.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, this is the Hawaiian god of anger."
Ben Wyatt,It reminded us of you when you're at work.
Ron Swanson,A handsome gentleman.
Leslie Knope,We did not forget Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,"Right, right."
Leslie Knope,"We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog."
Jerry Gergich,Same thing you got me from your trip to Washington!
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, we got you an autographed portrait of your personal hero."
Tom Haverford,No way!
Tom Haverford,Scott Caan from Hawaii five0!
Ben Wyatt,"April, as requested, we threw that box you gave us into that volcano."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, as you requested, got you a three pack of white Tshirts from Target."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,All mine are dirty.
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Hawaii."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here."
Leslie Knope,Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,I love the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think it's useless.
Leslie Knope,I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.
Leslie Knope,My number one target the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,they rake me over the coals.
Leslie Knope,"Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!"
Leslie Knope,It's all in good fun.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need more jokes, people."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me."
Leslie Knope,So I need you guys to pick up the slack.
Ron Swanson,I have a joke for you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,The government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently.
Leslie Knope,"That's not really a joke, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I disagree.
Ron Swanson,I find it hilarious.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris!"
Ann Perkins,Got to run to a meeting.
Ann Perkins,With Ron.
Chris Traeger,Great idea!
Chris Traeger,I'll run to my next meeting.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, the door was open."
Ron Swanson,I wish this office had only walls.
Ann Perkins,"Chris broke up with his girlfriend a week ago, and I have decided to ask him to be the father of my baby."
Ann Perkins,Except I cannot work up the nerve to do it.
Ann Perkins,Turns out they don't make greeting cards for asking your exboyfriend if he will artificially inseminate you.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, Ron, I could use your advice on how to be blunt and honest."
Ann Perkins,"I want my friend to do something for me, and I don't know how to ask him."
Ron Swanson,What do you want him to do?
Ann Perkins,Plant ficuses.
Ann Perkins,In my front yard.
Ann Perkins,Grossest metaphor ever.
Ron Swanson,I've seen your house.
Ron Swanson,You'd have more success if he planted ficuses in your backyard.
Ann Perkins,"No, I don't think so."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?"
Ron Swanson,Then plant the damn ficuses yourself.
Ann Perkins,I wish that were possible.
Jessica Wicks,We are so excited to have you working with us here at the allnew Sweetums Foundation.
Jessica Wicks,This is your office.
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Ben Wyatt,And look at that art.
Jessica Wicks,"Ah, yes."
Jessica Wicks,My late husband.
Jessica Wicks,He was so decrepit.
Ben Wyatt,I really like helping people.
Ben Wyatt,Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.
Ben Wyatt,"So, win win."
Ben Wyatt,Except for the rain forest.
Jessica Wicks,I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums' public image is currently at an alltime low.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts."
Jessica Wicks,Well You know what they say about rumors.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,They're mostly true.
Ben Wyatt,Including the rat thing?
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,What are you gonna do?
Jessica Wicks,It's where all the flavor comes from.
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, would you look at that."
Jessica Wicks,There is a smudge on my tail.
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Jessica Wicks,All better.
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, where politicians and the media make fun of each other."
Extra,"But, if you ask me, we should be making fun of the food."
Extra,"""I am not the cook."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Do you happen to have a can opener?
Leslie Knope,'Cause I'm about to open this on you.
Kim Terlando,"Did you make that can of ""whoop ass"" for this exact moment?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I came prepared."
Kim Terlando,I'd expect nothing less.
Kim Terlando,Good luck with your speech.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck."
Leslie Knope,It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look, it has one."
Leslie Knope,That's how ready I am.
Kim Terlando,I'm glad you're so confident.
Kim Terlando,Nice to see you.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to see you too.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, can I talk to you for a second?"
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,I cannot wait.
Chris Traeger,One second.
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, sir."
Chris Traeger,I think I accidentally got the meat option.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, and I got the veggie option."
Chris Traeger,"Shauna MalwaeTweep, my exgirlfriend."
Chris Traeger,It seems like you and I have a classic mix 'em up.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, fancy meeting you here."
Chris Traeger,"This isn't awkward for you, is it?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Chris, it's okay."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You wanna switch?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm starving.
Chris Traeger,Definitely.
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Check out the new digs.
Tom Haverford,This place is insane.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks for coming, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm super swamped, and I need your help."
April Ludgate,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,You came down here to pass on helping me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I wanted to see what your face looked like when I said no."
April Ludgate,It was totally worth it.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, are you okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,It's just that life is pointless and nothing matters and I'm always tired.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, I can't sleep, I'm overeating, none of my old hobbies interest me."
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police academy exam, his selfesteem has hit rock bottom."
April Ludgate,He's always sad and sweaty.
April Ludgate,He's usually happy and sweaty.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pick our first charity by tomorrow, and there's a million applications."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guys help me sort 'em out?
April Ludgate,You know what?
April Ludgate,This sounds like fun.
April Ludgate,"Babe, come on."
April Ludgate,Let's help him.
April Ludgate,It'll be fun.
Tom Haverford,"Well, it sounds like you guys got it covered."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna head out.
Tom Haverford,Actually have my own charity to attend to.
Tom Haverford,Tommy's tummy foundation.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they bring me fancy lunches here."
Ben Wyatt,"If you stay, you can have some."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"Crab, caviar?"
Tom Haverford,"On behalf of Tommy's tummy foundation, I'm happy to accept this generous donation."
Extra,Please welcome Kim Terlando.
Kim Terlando,"Thank you, Martin."
Kim Terlando,It's nice to be here among all of these excellent journalists.
Kim Terlando,And also the people that work with me over at the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,That was my opener.
Kim Terlando,"Now I love working at the Sun, okay?"
Kim Terlando,"And I know you all think it's just a useless tabloid, but it's not."
Kim Terlando,It is great.
Kim Terlando,For housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,Those are my jokes.
Leslie Knope,She's stealing my jokes.
Kim Terlando,Some people say that the Sun has a problem with the truth.
Kim Terlando,"There's no problem, we just ignore it."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, stop laughing."
Leslie Knope,Those are stolen jokes!
Leslie Knope,Totally dead.
Leslie Knope,What am I gonna do?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"I just opened up a can of ""whoop ass"" on myself!"
Councilman Milton,I remember the very first Correspondents' Lunch.
Councilman Milton,I rode here in a horse and buggy.
Councilman Milton,"No, no, no, that wasn't a joke."
Councilman Milton,I actually did.
Councilman Milton,That also was not a joke.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them."
Leslie Knope,She must have gotten a copy of my speech.
Leslie Knope,Did anybody lose their copy?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Ron Swanson,Mine is right here.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, Geez."
Leslie Knope,Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.
Leslie Knope,And no dessert!
Leslie Knope,"I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy."
Leslie Knope,"Perkins, go."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow."
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay, so Councilman Milton is old, right?"
Ann Perkins,And he's wearing a green tie.
Ann Perkins,"So, like, maybe there's something there, where, like, he went to school with his high school buddies that were dinosaurs."
Ann Perkins,And his tie is green.
Ann Perkins,They're green.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny."
Leslie Knope,It's not your fault.
Leslie Knope,You've never had to compensate for anything.
Leslie Knope,The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I think I might have found something that's actually pretty cool.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, just put it aside, and I'll read it later."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Andy found it, and he's gonna tell you about it right now."
April Ludgate,"Go, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, it's the Redwood Music Program."
Andy Dwyer,It's an after school music class for at risk kids.
Andy Dwyer,It'll keep them off the street.
April Ludgate,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,"And the streets, as you know, are dangerous."
Andy Dwyer,Example I fell in a sewer grate once.
Andy Dwyer,I was there all day.
Andy Dwyer,"In conclusion, we cannot let our children live in the sewer any longer."
Andy Dwyer,"Redwood Music Program go, your honor, amen."
Ben Wyatt,That's a great idea.
Ben Wyatt,Anyone else come across anything good?
Ben Wyatt,Tom?
Tom Haverford,"Um, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I got a good one.
Tom Haverford,It's called the Clean Sheet Foundation.
Tom Haverford,That's my pick.
Ben Wyatt,They provide legal assistance to the KKK.
Ben Wyatt,This is your pick?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Can you pass the bonbons?
Joan Callamezzo,Perd Hapley is here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Or, as Perd would say, ""My name is Perd Hapley, and the person I see here today is me."""
Perd Hapley,Everyone seems to be laughing now.
Ann Perkins,Do you see what is happening with Chris and Shauna?
Ann Perkins,They are flirting like crazy.
Ann Perkins,It's disgusting.
Ann Perkins,They're in public.
Ron Swanson,That's called a conversation.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, there are no ficuses, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I wanted to ask Chris to be the father of my baby.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,And the metaphor you chose was planting ficuses in your front yard?
Ann Perkins,"I was gonna wait till he was single to ask him, but now he's flirting with Shauna again."
Ann Perkins,What do I do?
Ron Swanson,It's been nice talking to you.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just do impressions.
Leslie Knope,"""I'ma Borat."""
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?"
Leslie Knope,What does Neve Campbell sound like?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Someone, [bleep] tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like."
Donna Meagle,Just keep it short and get the hell out of there.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Joan Callamezzo,Our next guest has asked me to read this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I forgot I did this."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, no"
Joan Callamezzo,"Strap on your adult diapers, everyone."
Joan Callamezzo,"""Because you're about to wet yourself from laughter."
Joan Callamezzo,Give it up for Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"""Whassup,"" Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,Um Borat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's my time."
Leslie Knope,They're giving me the light.
Leslie Knope,"So, uh, I did great."
Extra,"Thank you, Leslie Knope."
Extra,You know what they say.
Extra,"Drama is hard, and sometimes comedy is not in our wheelhouse."
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, do you have to run that right now?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, Ben!"
Tom Haverford,These smoothies will just blend themselves!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Think I have our winner.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Rural Ambucare.
Ben Wyatt,They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.
April Ludgate,Ambulances are dumb.
April Ludgate,When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?
April Ludgate,What about Andy's music thing?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's totally fine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm happy for them.
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You know what I'm gonna do?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna head out to, uh, the car."
Andy Dwyer,"It's a little hot in here, a little sweaty."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm terribly disappointed."
Tom Haverford,But I'm sure the doctors or giraffes or whatever you decided to help will be thrilled with the whatever you decided to whatever.
Tom Haverford,I'm outtie.
Tom Haverford,"Great job, team."
Ben Wyatt,What?
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed."
April Ludgate,Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.
April Ludgate,You're so selfish.
Ben Wyatt,Selfish?
Ben Wyatt,I'm running a charity.
April Ludgate,"Oh, it's all about what you're doing, isn't it?"
April Ludgate,Classic Ben!
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, forgot the oysters."
Tom Haverford,Great work today.
Ann Perkins,Christopher.
Ann Perkins,"""Christoefur."""
Ann Perkins,It's like you have furry toes.
Chris Traeger,Hilarious.
Ann Perkins,I have a question for you.
Ann Perkins,It's something very important.
Ann Perkins,Which is What is your Spirit animal?
Chris Traeger,Jaguar.
Chris Traeger,Why do you ask?
Ann Perkins,Doing a survey.
Ann Perkins,"Well, survey completed."
Ann Perkins,So take her easy.
Perd Hapley,"Uh, you didn't ask me."
Perd Hapley,"But if you had, the answer I would have given is Doggie."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Ann wants to ask you something right now."
Ron Swanson,"Go, Ann."
Ann Perkins,In front of Perd?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,No more delays.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Ann Perkins,I want to have a baby.
Ann Perkins,Will you be the sperm donor?
Perd Hapley,The story of this situation is it's extremely personal.
Ann Perkins,Think it over.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, permission to leave the corner."
Leslie Knope,Denied.
Jerry Gergich,"But, look, I did not lose your speech after all."
Jerry Gergich,I forgot.
Jerry Gergich,I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.
Jerry Gergich,"It's a little moist, but it is still here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then how did Kim get the speech?"
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.
Leslie Knope,They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.
Leslie Knope,And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.
Leslie Knope,I've been hacked!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, smashing your phone won't stop hacking."
Jerry Gergich,That's also my phone.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, quiet!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked."
Leslie Knope,"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month."
Chris Traeger,There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.
Chris Traeger,And I should know.
Chris Traeger,I've had many women steal my undershirts.
Leslie Knope,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.
Leslie Knope,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever."
Leslie Knope,I need to know what they might use against me.
Ron Swanson,You can't hack into a typewriter.
Ron Swanson,That's all I have to say.
Leslie Knope,"Can it, Unabomber."
Leslie Knope,This is an emergency.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,You wanted to talk to me?
Andy Dwyer,Or probably not.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I don't even want to talk to me."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I wanted to talk to you."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after school music program.
Andy Dwyer,I totally get it.
Andy Dwyer,"The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's exactly right."
Extra,"Your morning tea, Mr. Wyatt."
Andy Dwyer,Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,"You could help, like, a zillion more charities."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's also exactly right."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I should have thought of that.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,I farted five minutes ago.
Andy Dwyer,Didn't even smell it till just now.
Andy Dwyer,That's how tight my pants are.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow Later days, dudes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nothing too bad so far."
Donna Meagle,"There's a ""Top Ten Ben's butt 2012 slide show."""
Donna Meagle,You emailed it to Ben and Ann And The Huffington Post?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that."
Ron Swanson,Who is Todo Toadfoot?
Ron Swanson,"You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it ""Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland."""
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters."
Leslie Knope,I am a little embarrassed by that.
Chris Traeger,"Here's one to me, and it just says ""Thanks."""
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,I keep getting emails all the time!
Leslie Knope,I have to do well at this press conference!
Leslie Knope,Donna!
Donna Meagle,"Listen, freaky."
Donna Meagle,Every single one of my boyfriends has tried to hack into my email.
Donna Meagle,I've got an idea Everybody out.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse."
Chris Traeger,You haven't returned any of my calls.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified."
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt.
Chris Traeger,I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.
Chris Traeger,And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty."
Ann Perkins,You're right.
Ann Perkins,And I'll start now.
Ann Perkins,You are a great specimen.
Ann Perkins,That's a terrible choice of words.
Ann Perkins,If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.
Chris Traeger,Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?
Ann Perkins,"Of course, yes."
Ann Perkins,Take as much time as you want.
Ann Perkins,"Or just maybe, like, a couple days."
Ann Perkins,'Cause I'm getting antsy.
Ann Perkins,And I'm ovulating on Thursday.
Ann Perkins,"So, chop-chop."
Ann Perkins,But take your time.
Ann Perkins,"Wear loose pants! I gotta tell you, Ron."
Ann Perkins,You were absolutely and totally right.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,Stop talking and get out.
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Jessica Wicks,The redneck ambulance is a great choice.
Jessica Wicks,We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.
Ben Wyatt,We can figure out the photo later.
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday."
Jessica Wicks,Yay!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes."
Ben Wyatt,I'm giving up this office.
Ben Wyatt,And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.
Ben Wyatt,It's way out of hand.
Jessica Wicks,"Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible."
Ben Wyatt,"I know, and it's a huge waste of money."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around."
Ben Wyatt,And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.
Jessica Wicks,Get yourself a matching nude portrait? I can call the painter.
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
Leslie Knope,"First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs."
Leslie Knope,I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is it chocolate?
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope,It's dirt.
Leslie Knope,"The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards."""
Leslie Knope,So not too shabby.
Kim Terlando,"Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer."
Leslie Knope,I would I would deny that report.
Kim Terlando,I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.
Kim Terlando,"How serious is that, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"It's very serious, Kim."
Leslie Knope,"It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks."
Leslie Knope,I really thought you guys would gasp there.
Kim Terlando,That is a baseless accusation.
Leslie Knope,Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Leslie Knope,"Which, side-note, was a terrible movie."
Leslie Knope,"It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband."
Leslie Knope,But that is neither here nor there.
Donna Meagle,"The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap."
Donna Meagle,Into which you have fallen.
Kim Terlando,"Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys."
Kim Terlando,Unlike you losers.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando? Get to steppin'."
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes."
Leslie Knope,So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Leslie Knope,"Lucky for you, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,I'm very excited to be here.
Leslie Knope,You know who else is excited to be here?
Leslie Knope,Neve Campbell.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,What a great party of five.
Donna Meagle,"All right, thank you, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man."
Andy Dwyer,Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.
Andy Dwyer,Also a man.
Ben Wyatt,"What No, Andy, I've already chosen the person."
Ben Wyatt,And it is not Tom
Andy Dwyer,Then who is it?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard."
Andy Dwyer,That guy? Do you even know him?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, it's you."
Ben Wyatt,I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.
Ben Wyatt,Will you come work for me? Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,What's happening? Oh.
