Tom Haverford,Is this not one of those?
Tom Haverford,I might have misread the vibe.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, dude, you have to be cooler about this."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend, but if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's gonna make it really hard to know if this is actually anything, so just keep it on the DL, okay?"
Tom Haverford,I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.

Andy Dwyer,I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
Andy Dwyer,"It's called Catch Your Dream, and it's amazing."
Andy Dwyer,"It's kind of like We Are The World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society."
Andy Dwyer,"Here's the thing we need backup singers, and I thought, ""who better to be backup singers than Leslie's campaign team?"""
Andy Dwyer,Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
Andy Dwyer,My job is the song.
Andy Dwyer,"She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fundraising barbecue, and I dropped them all all of them, like a thousand, so I really want to do a good job."
Andy Dwyer,"So we're gonna record this bitch tonight, 6 o'clock Doubletime Studio."

Dave Sanderson,"We had a romantic ""romantical"" involvement until I relocated to San Diego, which is that's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles."
Dave Sanderson,So we terminated our involvement at that time.
Leslie Knope,Are you here for a while?
Dave Sanderson,"No, just tonight, for the chief's retirement thing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant."
Dave Sanderson,Cool.
Dave Sanderson,I'm gonna go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, see you later."
Leslie Knope,You should come to dinner with us.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I shouldn't have invited him.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no No, that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you."
Ben Wyatt,"Honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it."
Leslie Knope,"No, look, he's here for one night."
Leslie Knope,"He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which bonus will make all the other cops love you."

Andy Dwyer,Jerry Ah.
April Ludgate,That's vandalism.
Ron Swanson,I have a problem.
Ron Swanson,This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
April Ludgate,I've heard of him.
April Ludgate,I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
Ron Swanson,"From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy."
Ron Swanson,He doesn't want his nosy coworkers discussing his music with him or knowing that he exists.
Ron Swanson,"So, if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it."
April Ludgate,"You got it, Duke."
Ron Swanson,Don't call me that.
April Ludgate,"I dig your groovy tunes, man."
April Ludgate,Did you hear me?
April Ludgate,"I said, ""I dig your groovy tunes, man."""
Andy Dwyer,"Yo, Chuck, we're going to go ahead and play and sing at the same time."
Andy Dwyer,I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.
Burly,So we have to play it perfectly every time?
Andy Dwyer,"No, Burly, play it ""unperfectly."""
Burly,You mean imperfectly?
Andy Dwyer,I mean perfectly.

Leslie Knope,He's really smart.
Dave Sanderson,"You know, a campaign manager is only as good as the campaign person that he is managing."
Dave Sanderson,So I'm trying to say you're a real smart lady.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, you can say that again."
Ben Wyatt,"If anything, I'm holding her back."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, Ben."
Dave Sanderson,I said my thing first.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that's why we were at the police station today."
Ben Wyatt,We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, yeah?"
Dave Sanderson,He was a buddy of mine.
Dave Sanderson,I could probably get him to endorse you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that would be amazing."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.

Dave Sanderson,"No, I don't think I said that."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, why would you tell me that here and now?"
Dave Sanderson,Because it's accurate.
Dave Sanderson,"And because he's not here right now, so I thought this would be a good time."
Dave Sanderson,Can I just please talk to you about this for five minutes?
Leslie Knope,"No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, we'll get rid of him."
Dave Sanderson,That's a good call.
Leslie Knope,"No, bad call."
Leslie Knope,That's not the call.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, if we leave now while he's in the whiz palace"
Leslie Knope,"No, listen to me."

April Ludgate,"He's a gorgeous genius, people."
April Ludgate,Don't question his methods.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins?"
Tom Haverford,Tsk.

Dave Sanderson,I would definitely endorse Leslie.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.

Dave Sanderson,I think I'm gonna take a little go outside.
Dave Sanderson,You look like I could use some company.
Ben Wyatt,What?

Andy Dwyer,"Mine's really just a cup of honey, cause tea is gross."
Andy Dwyer,"Now, here's the thing we're gonna start from scratch."
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna get rid of this whole sucky vibe.
Andy Dwyer,I'm thinking we could

April Ludgate,To the man!
April Ludgate,"I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe!"
Andy Dwyer,See where her head's at?
Andy Dwyer,Follow her lead.
Andy Dwyer,That was amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"Next thing, I want to hear how all of us sing on our own, so we can figure out where we're going wrong."
Andy Dwyer,"This is not an audition, so relax."
Andy Dwyer,"But if you don't sing good, you're out of here."
Tom Haverford,"I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons."
Ann Perkins,I think you shouldn't whisper.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Ann's mad at me now, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve."
Tom Haverford,"I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, you're first."

Leslie Knope,"Oh, dessert's overrated and gross."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, actually, Ben, would you mind if I talked to Leslie alone?"
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you."
Dave Sanderson,I don't want to talk to you.
Dave Sanderson,I want to talk to Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I want to talk to you, and if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then."

Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm calling this.
Ann Perkins,We're done.
Tom Haverford,What about our next date?
Tom Haverford,"If you want another date, keep walking away."
Tom Haverford,She's still walking.
Dave Sanderson,"I need you to know something, man to man."
Dave Sanderson,"I still have feelings for Leslie, in a womanly fashion, and I believe she feels the same towards me, in a manly way."
Ben Wyatt,"She doesn't feel the same way, because she has a boyfriend um, me, and and and and we love each other."
Dave Sanderson,"That's that information is it's not pertinent Well, I Frankly, at this juncture."
Dave Sanderson,"I just said to you one thing, and you're ""contraring"" me."
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a word.
Dave Sanderson,I think we'd all appreciate it if you would just let me have three minutes with her alone.
Dave Sanderson,"Consequently, I'd like you to clear the area."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me."
Ben Wyatt,I think that that's reasonable.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, and I want to thank you."
Dave Sanderson,I want to thank you for having this talk with me Man to man.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you."
Dave Sanderson,Thank you very much.

Dave Sanderson,You brought it on yourself.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Dave Sanderson,I've got something I gotta say to you.
Leslie Knope,Where's Ben?
Dave Sanderson,He left.
Leslie Knope,He left?
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, he said, ""I got somewhere I got to important to go, and I don't respect her as a woman."""
Leslie Knope,He said that?
Dave Sanderson,And he acted more effeminate than he does in front of you.
Dave Sanderson,"Just look, I got some something to say, and it's emotional, and it's important."
Dave Sanderson,I need 30 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what?"
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Romance
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pee really bad, ironically."
Leslie Knope,What were you thinking?
Dave Sanderson,"I was thinking that I would cuff him, andand then I could have time to speak to you, and then you would decide to be with me, and then I would come back here, and we would uncuff him together."
Leslie Knope,"Can you just uncuff him, please?"
Dave Sanderson,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Would you look at that?
Tom Haverford,Nature is throwing me a bone.
Tom Haverford,"Haverford playbook move number two ""ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain."
Ron Swanson,"I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be overthinking this."
Andy Dwyer,"This song has to be perfect, Ron, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Leslie trusted me with it.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I?"
Andy Dwyer,This is the only way I can help.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
Andy Dwyer,That's worked before.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie is going to love it, I promise."
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music?"
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Ron Swanson,Tsk.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, take a walk."
Ron Swanson,Clear your head.
Ron Swanson,I bet it does you some good.
Tom Haverford,Ann?
Tom Haverford,Booboo?
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to say, ""I told you so,"" but"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I was the one who didn't want to go.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly."
Leslie Knope,Let's just go home.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're going to Trumple's thing."
Leslie Knope,"No, let's not go there."
Leslie Knope,"I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more."
Ben Wyatt,"You don't care about the endorsement? Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision making get in the way of this election."
Ann Perkins,What happened to you?
Tom Haverford,"I was waiting outside in the rain for you, 'cause I thought you would come out and be like, ""aw, he's all wet."""
Tom Haverford,"""That's so romantic,"" but you didn't, and now I got the sniffies."
Ann Perkins,What on earth would make you think I would like that?
Tom Haverford,Movies.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, Tom! Why do you have to be so ""you"" all the time?"
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Will you help me get out of these wet clothes?
Extra,"Hey, you want a beer?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Extra,"If you're driving, I can't give you a beer."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, then, no, thank you."
Extra,"It's a celebration, man."
Extra,You have to have a drink.
Ben Wyatt,I'll definitely have one.
Extra,Don't make a mistake you'll always regret.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, just tell me what you want me to do."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben."
Leslie Knope,"He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, that's fair."
Dave Sanderson,I'm sorry.
Dave Sanderson,"That was dumb, all that stuff I did."
Dave Sanderson,"You just you make me crazy, and I guess I'm just surprised that you know, that's the guy you fell in love with."
Dave Sanderson,"He's very well, he's shrimpy, and he's small."
Leslie Knope,"Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's"
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I get it."
Dave Sanderson,I surrender.
Dave Sanderson,I just want to know that you're happy and you're protected.
Leslie Knope,I'm very happy.
Leslie Knope,And he's not shrimpy.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, good man."
Dave Sanderson,"I mean him, for doing that, not the guy who called you a bitch."
Dave Sanderson,You tell me where he is.
Dave Sanderson,"I'll punch him, too."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, guys, here's the deal, we got to completely start over."
Andy Dwyer,I wrote a new song it's called The Promise Of Tomorrow's Wings.
Andy Dwyer,"It's brilliant about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just delete everything, all right?"
Ron Swanson,"Hold on, Chuck."
Ron Swanson,"Just listen to the song one more time, and then make a decision."
Andy Dwyer,Where's that saxophone coming from?
Ron Swanson,I don't know.
Ron Swanson,I don't know the first thing about music.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, is that a new mix? It sounds way better."
Ron Swanson,See? You just needed to clear your head.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, you guys, who is this? This looks just like Ow, that was loud."
Ben Wyatt,"I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is."
Extra,"Gun! No, no, no, no!"
Ben Wyatt,"It's just a, it's paper."
Ben Wyatt,"It's, I was reaching for paper."
Chief Trumple,"It's all right, boys."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Ben Wyatt,"Newport's just gonna keep on buying you guys a couple new cars or some new uniforms, as always."
Ben Wyatt,That guy's all about short-term solutions.
Ben Wyatt,"Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace?"
Chief Trumple,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening."
Andy Dwyer,"Nice work, guys."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, a little tradition after Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze, who's it gonna be?"
Tom Haverford,"All right, look, I know I messed up, but there's something I got to say to you."
Tom Haverford,"No playbook, no gimmicks, just me, Tom, talking to you as a person."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I would like that."
Tom Haverford,"Good, 'cause this is what I really want to say."
Tom Haverford,"Baby, I'm sorry for how I acted but if you give me another chance I could be the boo of your dreams, girl so, when you're sleeping and you're dreamin' of a boo"
Tom Haverford,"I want that boo to be me, I want me to be that boo so will you date me? I'm saying date me"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yes."
Ann Perkins,"Fine, fine, fine!"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, I will."
Tom Haverford,"Baby, baby, baby, baby"
Ann Perkins,I will go out with you.
Ann Perkins,"Enough, please!"
Tom Haverford,Really?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you wore me down."
Ann Perkins,"Just stop singing, please."
Tom Haverford,"The four sweetest words in the English language, ""You wore me down."""
Ben Wyatt,Go ahead.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Go ahead.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Dave, go ahead."
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, go ahead."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's fine."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Dave Sanderson,You're waiting.
Dave Sanderson,It's your turn.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, I'm not."
Dave Sanderson,You're not waiting?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Dave Sanderson,"It feels like you're It feels to me like you're being overly respectful of all these cops, and you're letting them go in all in front of you."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just standing here.
Dave Sanderson,Why would you be standing just here?
Ben Wyatt,I was just checking
Dave Sanderson,Get in the go in!
Ben Wyatt,Thank you so much.
