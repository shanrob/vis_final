Jeremy Jamm,"Knopey, my girl, wuddup?"
Jeremy Jamm,I just farted.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.
Jeremy Jamm,"I missed you, too."
Leslie Knope,The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.
Leslie Knope,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty."
Leslie Knope,"Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, little chica."
Jeremy Jamm,"Before we go any further, I need to ask my girlfriend how she wants me to vote."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Who's your girlfriend?
Tammy 2,"Hello, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Jamm and Tammy!
Leslie Knope,"""Jammy."""
Jeremy Jamm,Jammy.
Leslie Knope,You guys are so cute.
Leslie Knope,"When did you-- Why would either one of you, you know-- Why?"
Leslie Knope,"Dear God, why?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hit it off at karaoke.
Jeremy Jamm,"She saw me nail Gangsta's Paradise, I saw her bite the door guy."
Jeremy Jamm,She then let me buy her a bunch of purses.
Jeremy Jamm,And the rest is history.
Tammy 2,A bunch.
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,This is great news.
Leslie Knope,Because Ron is my opponent in this.
Leslie Knope,And you live to torture Ron.
Leslie Knope,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.
Tammy 2,Maybe you're not a blonde bimbo after all.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tammy 2,Well.
Tammy 2,Let me mull it over.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park."
Leslie Knope,It's worth it.
Leslie Knope,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals."
Ben Wyatt,"Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations."
Ben Wyatt,I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests.
Ben Wyatt,"For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont because it's a hotel in Los Angeles, not a wine."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, because he's been famously dead for 60 years."
Joan Callamezzo,What?
April Ludgate,"Hi, Joan."
April Ludgate,"Hi, my name is April."
April Ludgate,And I'm your biggest fan and I pretty much hate everyone.
April Ludgate,Will you sign your ninth memoir for me?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, it would be my pleasure."
Joan Callamezzo,You said your name was Glenn?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I did."
Joan Callamezzo,That's pretty.
April Ludgate,"Joan has always been kind of a train wreck, but the last three years, she's gone off the deep end."
April Ludgate,She did a string of shows from rehab.
Joan Callamezzo,"Victoria Herzog, you were a successful attorney from Wilmington, Delaware."
Joan Callamezzo,Then you hit rock bottom.
Extra,This is supposed to be anonymous.
April Ludgate,She once gave every member in her audience a car.
April Ludgate,"One car, that they all had to fight for."
April Ludgate,"Oh, and last year, she did a show where she called all of her exboyfriends while sitting on a washing machine."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Erik, if you didn't give it to me, then who did?"
April Ludgate,I love her so much.
April Ludgate,I hope she's my real mom.
Andy Dwyer,"""Entrepreneur bachelor, Tom Haverford, is making quite a splash in the culinary world, and we expect even bigger things from him in 2018."""
Andy Dwyer,Tom.
Andy Dwyer,What does culinary mean?
Tom Haverford,It means it's a cause for celebration.
Tom Haverford,"Round of drinks for everyone, on the house!"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Let me also get a chicken parm and a lasagna on the side.
Andy Dwyer,And a spaghetti to go.
Andy Dwyer,On the house!
Extra,Yes.
Tom Haverford,That's the fourth engagement this month.
Tom Haverford,"I'm tired of being an ""Entrepreneur/bachelor."""
Tom Haverford,I need to find someone.
Andy Dwyer,"Are you bummed, Tom?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I got a quick fix for that."
Andy Dwyer,Let's get hammered.
Andy Dwyer,Everything here is free.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Miss Knope.
Ron Swanson,How's that zero dollar bid coming along?
Ron Swanson,"You know, in my experience with capitalism, people would normally expect money in exchange for their goods and land."
Leslie Knope,"In my experience with butt faces, you are one."
Councilman Howser,We will now hear arguments about the Newport property.
Councilman Howser,"First, on behalf of Gryzzl, Mr. Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"When you vote tomorrow, we believe you should vote to rezone the land for commercial use."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I'm convinced."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tomorrow, I'm voting for Gryzzl."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.
Jeremy Jamm,Your plan?
Jeremy Jamm,You know who else had a plan?
Leslie Knope,Please don't say Hitler.
Jeremy Jamm,Adolf Hitler!
Jeremy Jamm,I'm with Swanson.
Jeremy Jamm,It's a stache thing.
Jeremy Jamm,Stache bros.
Jeremy Jamm,You wouldn't understand.
Jeremy Jamm,We're done here.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was easy."
Leslie Knope,What the hell just happened?
Joan Callamezzo,"Thank you, Commissioner Gordon, people of Gotham."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,She thinks she's in Batman.
Joan Callamezzo,"People often ask me, ""Joan, how do you do it?"""
Joan Callamezzo,It's simple.
Joan Callamezzo,I love being on TV.
Joan Callamezzo,I've known what I've wanted to do since I was 10 years old.
Joan Callamezzo,That is the key to living a good life.
Joan Callamezzo,"If you don't absolutely love what you do with a true passion, then what's the point in doing it at all?"
Joan Callamezzo,"On a separate note, I think that America should have a purge night."
Joan Callamezzo,Let me explain why.
April Ludgate,Do I even like my job?
Tom Haverford,"I must be the first person ever to have money, power, and notoriety, but still feel empty."
Tom Haverford,I need someone to share my life with.
Andy Dwyer,What if your future wife is somebody that you already know?
Andy Dwyer,Let's open your Gryzzl page.
Andy Dwyer,What about her?
Andy Dwyer,She's cute.
Andy Dwyer,Date her.
Tom Haverford,That's my cousin.
Andy Dwyer,How about her?
Tom Haverford,That's my dad!
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drunk, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Why are you only friends with your family?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look, you got a message from somebody named Lucy in Chicago."
Andy Dwyer,She looks familiar.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, we used to date."
Tom Haverford,I was super into her.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,Was she in Destiny's Child?
Tom Haverford,"""Hey Tom, saw the article, you boss!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Let's catch up soon."""
Tom Haverford,"""Miss you."""
Andy Dwyer,Do you realize what's happening?
Andy Dwyer,We've been sitting here searching for your soul mate this whole time and then Lucy just Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?
Andy Dwyer,It's a sign!
Andy Dwyer,And we have to catch it.
Andy Dwyer,We are going to Chicago.
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Think about what you're saying right now.
Tom Haverford,'Cause it's the smartest idea anyone's ever had!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,What did you do?
Ron Swanson,I delivered a flawless presentation and secured tomorrow's vote.
Leslie Knope,"No, you got all sneaky and snuck around and snooked that vote away from me."
Leslie Knope,And I know this because earlier I sneaked and snooked around and Jammy was supposed to vote for me!
Leslie Knope,The snooker has become the snorked!
Ron Swanson,What are you talking--
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"So, you two are together now."
Ron Swanson,My condolences to both of you.
Leslie Knope,You guys were supposed to vote for me.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, I would never do anything to help you."
Tammy 2,You've always been against me and Ron.
Tammy 2,"You're a big part of the reason that he and I aren't together, and I had to settle for this placeholder."
Jeremy Jamm,I love you so much.
Leslie Knope,So you thought if you voted for Ron you could actually win him back?
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,That's right.
Tammy 2,"Did it work, baby?"
Tammy 2,Are you horny with gratitude?
Ron Swanson,You two more than deserve each other.
Ron Swanson,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,The vote is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't get Jamm out from Tammy's clutches, I'm doomed."
Leslie Knope,It's like rescuing a bunny from a lion.
Leslie Knope,But that lion is a demonic sociopath with really nice cleavage.
Extra,"All right, we're here."
Tom Haverford,"Sir, where the hell are we?"
Extra,Chicago.
Extra,That'll be 830 dollars.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no!"
Tom Haverford,This is so dumb!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, awesome."
Tom Haverford,Turn the car around.
Tom Haverford,We're going back home.
Extra,No way.
Extra,Pay me.
Extra,And get the hell outta my cab.
Andy Dwyer,Pay the man.
Andy Dwyer,Chicago!
Andy Dwyer,The big apple.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's where Lucy works."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah?
Tom Haverford,We must've given the cabbie the address.
Tom Haverford,"Let's just get something to eat, and fly home."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,We came all this way.
Andy Dwyer,"Tom, we should at least say hi."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,You can't not talk to someone for five years and then show up unannounced where they work in a different city.
Tom Haverford,That's what murderers do before they murder someone.
Lucy,Tom?
Lucy,I thought that was you.
Lucy,What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, uh--"
Lucy,"You're not gonna murder me, are you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm here doin' stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Um Lucy.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer, remember me?"
Lucy,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He's here helping me find a place to live.
Andy Dwyer,I just got a job here.
Andy Dwyer,"And then when you hit him up on Gryzzl, he was like, ""Let's go say hi to Lucy since we're already here in Chicago."""
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,That's the deal.
Lucy,"Cool, what job is it?"
Andy Dwyer,Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.
Tom Haverford,"No, he's working at a nonprofit."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Am I?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks."
Lucy,"Well, listen, I got some stuff I gotta do in the office, but I wanna hang out."
Lucy,Do you wanna meet me here in an hour?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,We'll go a little Chicago deep dish pizza.
Tom Haverford,And go watch the Bears.
Lucy,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry I started doing that.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Except hearing Joan talk about her passion and doing what you really love totally freaked me out.
April Ludgate,"Eight years ago, I accepted a random internship at the parks department, and then Leslie told me to do a bunch of stuff, and now I'm executive director of regional whatever, and I don't even know what it means."
April Ludgate,And I never even asked myself if I even really like it.
April Ludgate,"I mean, it's like, what is my purpose in life?"
April Ludgate,What do I even care about?
April Ludgate,My insides are dying.
Ben Wyatt,"So, not fine."
April Ludgate,I don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,I have to quit.
Ben Wyatt,To do what?
April Ludgate,I'm just gonna go live under a bridge and ask people riddles before they cross.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,Do you remember what Joan said at the ceremony?
April Ludgate,That it doesn't count as stripping if no one pays you?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, she did say that."
Ben Wyatt,But no.
Ben Wyatt,She knew she wanted to be on TV when she was 10.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what did you wanna be when you were 10?"
April Ludgate,It says here the future of caskets may just be biodegradable plastic.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you don't say."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Are you chilly?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a little chilly, I think."
April Ludgate,No.
Dan,"Hey, guys."
Dan,Welcome.
Dan,I'm Dan.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben, this is April."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm scared of death.
April Ludgate,I'm just really interested in learning what you do.
Dan,You're gonna love it here.
Dan,People are dying to get in.
Dan,"Come on, come on."
Dan,We'll start down at the cadaver chute!
April Ludgate,The cadaver chute.
April Ludgate,Come on!
Leslie Knope,So this is where you wanna eat lunch?
Leslie Knope,In a steakhouse?
Leslie Knope,Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome?
Leslie Knope,"God, I hate that I know that."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it's murder on the old plumbing."
Jeremy Jamm,But Tammy only wants me to eat steak and whiskey.
Jeremy Jamm,She has my stool analyzed just to keep me honest.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this relationship is that healthy.
Leslie Knope,I mean it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron.
Leslie Knope,And you're Jeremy Jamm!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, come on."
Leslie Knope,You love Porsches and spiked iced tea.
Leslie Knope,And you have a Hooters platinum card.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy doesn't really let me do that stuff anymore.
Jeremy Jamm,"But, you know, it's good, you know?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm better now.
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, sure, I'm depressed, and I'm constantly sick, and nothing really brings me joy."
Jeremy Jamm,But it just feels right.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Jeremy Jamm,"Help me, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I used to be so great.
Jeremy Jamm,Remember?
Jeremy Jamm,Everybody thought so.
Leslie Knope,Well--
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,This is worse than I thought.
Leslie Knope,You're broken.
Leslie Knope,She has broken you.
Leslie Knope,You need to get away from her.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, look at that."
Jeremy Jamm,More hair came out.
Lucy,"Yeah, I think you're really gonna like it here."
Lucy,"And obviously, everyone's in a really great mood now because of the Cubs winning the series."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It seems really nice.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I am gonna miss Pawnee, though."
Andy Dwyer,My wife's there for cryin' out loud.
Lucy,"Yeah, tell me about Pawnee."
Lucy,It sounds like it's really changed.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,There's a ton of new businesses.
Tom Haverford,"Gryzzl came in, they gave everyone free tablets and WiFi and phones."
Tom Haverford,"You can watch Hitch 2 anytime, anywhere!"
Lucy,Finally!
Lucy,That's the dream.
Lucy,"Part of me wants to go back, you know."
Lucy,I always kinda liked it there.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you got me really missing Pawnee now."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
Andy Dwyer,Am I making the right decision?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ron Swanson,Why are you here?
Leslie Knope,I'm calling a temporary truce.
Leslie Knope,You need to help me break up Jamm and Tammy.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,You just want Jamm to switch his vote.
Ron Swanson,"What is this, revenge for Morningstar?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it is not about that."
Leslie Knope,It's not about the vote.
Leslie Knope,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.
Leslie Knope,This is about saving someone's soul.
Ron Swanson,He is a monster.
Ron Swanson,Monsters do not have souls.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, have you ever seen Monsters, Inc.?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,Engage in the culture once in a while!
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,Get in here!
Ron Swanson,"Good God, man, what happened to you?"
Leslie Knope,Tammy happened to him!
Leslie Knope,"Remind you of anyone, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,We need to put our issues aside and defend this miserable person!
Ron Swanson,Jeremy.
Ron Swanson,This is a gold bar.
Leslie Knope,You keep that in your desk?
Ron Swanson,I will give you this gold bar if you say one unflattering thing about Tammy.
Jeremy Jamm,"If I do, does Tammy get to keep the gold?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to Tammy, the code is the same as that of the battlefield."
Ron Swanson,"First, you leave no man behind."
Ron Swanson,"Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare."
Ron Swanson,Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.
Ron Swanson,I made this Tammy deprogramming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.
Ron Swanson,"First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand."
Ron Swanson,"It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it."
Ron Swanson,The first step is to cut out all sex.
Jeremy Jamm,That won't be necessary.
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't done the deed yet.
Jeremy Jamm,She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.
Ron Swanson,"Well, all the more reason to wear it."
Ron Swanson,"She knows she has that card left to play, and you best believe she will."
Leslie Knope,We're also gonna try a Pavlovian technique.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is holding Tammy's perfume, Girth."
Jeremy Jamm,Oh.
Jeremy Jamm,It smells good.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy.
Jeremy Jamm,How many times are we gonna do this?
Leslie Knope,Until the bottle is empty.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Jeremy Jamm,Tam-- No!
Ron Swanson,It's going well so far but it's too early to tell.
Ron Swanson,He was pretty far gone.
Dan,"Hopefully, we get a body in today so I can show you guys the really fun part."
Dan,Draining!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,I hate this so much.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Can I touch a dead body?
Dan,Whoa!
Dan,"Slow down, eager beaver!"
Dan,That doesn't happen for at least a year.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,How did you become a mortician?
April Ludgate,Can't I just sign up?
Dan,"Oh, gosh, no!"
Dan,You need two years of school and a year long apprenticeship.
Dan,The first few years are mostly paperwork and filing.
April Ludgate,Why is every job just paperwork?
Dan,"Hey, it's a living."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"I think we're gonna go, Dan."
April Ludgate,The reality of your life is incredibly depressing.
April Ludgate,"I'm just gonna stay at my current job until I get old and die and then end up here, being embalmed by some weirdo who had to go to school for three years just to cut my guts open."
April Ludgate,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God!"
Dan,"Okay, have a good one."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do some scenes and demonstrate ways that you can resist Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"I will play Tammy, Ron will play you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey there, horsey."
Leslie Knope,Time to mount up and ride on into Bonertown.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we get stanky in that pet store bathroom, Jamm?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Jeremy Jamm,Do it.
Ron Swanson,"There will be no sex today, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ron Swanson,"Instead, why don't you go into the pet store and feed yourself to the snakes?"
Ron Swanson,"To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ya big hunk of wiener meat."
Leslie Knope,"I've got forty hand towels, some energy bars, and a Chinese finger trap."
Leslie Knope,Let's get gross.
Ron Swanson,This gambit has failed.
Ron Swanson,"To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Jeremy Jamm,What are you wearing?
Ron Swanson,It's a crotch blinder of my own design.
Ron Swanson,"In this scenario, she will be coming at you pants-less."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, the doors are locked, windows secured, there is no way Tammy's getting in here."
Leslie Knope,"""Jamm! Strip down, you sex maggot!"""
Ron Swanson,And hold! What was your mistake? You didn't check the armoire.
Ron Swanson,Tammy once camped out in my attic for six days awaiting my arrival.
Ron Swanson,She survived on rats and rainwater.
Ron Swanson,Let's run it again!
Tom Haverford,"I gotta say, hanging out with Lucy's been so fun."
Tom Haverford,She's the best.
Andy Dwyer,"And I love that she's buying us stuff! Dude, make your move."
Andy Dwyer,Ask her out.
Tom Haverford,"I dunno, she lives here."
Tom Haverford,How would it even work?
Andy Dwyer,Life is about taking risks.
Andy Dwyer,"Look at me, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I'm moving to Chicago!
Tom Haverford,It's just us right now.
Tom Haverford,Do you really think you're moving here?
Lucy,"One XXL, one kid's XL."
Tom Haverford,Hey! You remembered my size!
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Lucy,You're welcome.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Lucy, can I ask you something?"
Lucy,"Of course, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering would you wanna maybe... Come work for me in Pawnee? I got the company and it's growing so fast, I can't do it all myself."
Tom Haverford,"And I need a manager, and you're a perfect candidate."
Lucy,"Wow, really? That does sound kinda awesome."
Lucy,And it'd be super fun to work with you.
Lucy,"I mean, I'd have to talk to my boyfriend about it first, butâ¦"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, of course! This is all perfect, and everything's worked out just as I'd hoped."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, huh?"
Tammy 2,"Hey, Jerebear."
Tammy 2,What are you doing with these two jabronis?
Jeremy Jamm,"Tammy, I've given this a lot of thought."
Jeremy Jamm,We should break up.
Tammy 2,"What's the matter, little boy? Did the bad people get to you?"
Jeremy Jamm,They just made me realize how unhealthy this is.
Jeremy Jamm,Literally.
Jeremy Jamm,"All the steak and whiskey, I have to wear a diaper."
Tammy 2,That's 'cause you're my widdle baby!
Leslie Knope,"We drilled you on this, Jamm! Baby talk, what do you do?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that wasn't terrible."
Tammy 2,"Don't listen to Leslie, she's just trying to manipulate you."
Tammy 2,All she cares about is herself and I can prove it.
Tammy 2,"How's this, Leslie? You leave us alone, and we swing the vote to you."
Tammy 2,Help you get your park.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Nice try.
Leslie Knope,"Stay strong, Jeremy."
Jeremy Jamm,"It's over, Tammy."
Tammy 2,Tell you what.
Tammy 2,It's been long enough.
Tammy 2,What do you say we consummate our relationship tonight? Huh? Let's do it.
Ron Swanson,And the last card is played.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Extra,This is a library!
Leslie Knope,Do you see what's happening here?
Jeremy Jamm,Ron. I need that crotch blinder!
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't."
Ron Swanson,Just end it.
Tammy 2,Look at my boobs.
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Tammy 2,Look downstairs.
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Tammy 2,There's a prize inside for you.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's over, Tammy."
Tammy 2,What?
Jeremy Jamm,"To hell with you, woman."
Jeremy Jamm,Goodbye.
Tammy 2,How dare you? Are you kidding me? You'll be back.
Tammy 2,They all come back! They call come back!
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Jeremy."
Ron Swanson,Turns out the crotch blinder was inside you all along.
Tammy 2,"Come on, everybody! Who wants to get it on? I'm naked."
April Ludgate,"Donna, what do I do? If working around corpses isn't even right for me, then nothing is."
April Ludgate,I feel totally lost.
Donna Meagle,Saturn's Return.
April Ludgate,What?
Donna Meagle,"Saturn's orbit around the sun takes roughly 29 years, and when it gets back to where it was when you were born, lots of turmoil, self-discovery."
Donna Meagle,"When I was your age, I got banned from every riverboat in Germany."
Ben Wyatt,Donna.
Ben Wyatt,April.
Ben Wyatt,What're you up to?
April Ludgate,"Oh, you know."
April Ludgate,Just regionally directing the Midwest whatever of who cares.
Jerry Gergich,Isn't it great? Can you believe that they pay me for this? Because I would do this for free.
Jerry Gergich,Geez!
Donna Meagle,"I do miss you, Terry."
Donna Meagle,Let me get you some napkins.
Ben Wyatt,April.
Ben Wyatt,You looked at one horrifying job.
Ben Wyatt,I've got a few more ideas.
Ben Wyatt,We'll find you something you like.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
April Ludgate,"Okay, but you can't tell Leslie I might leave."
April Ludgate,She'll have a heart attack.
April Ludgate,Promise?
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
April Ludgate,Why are you so into helping me right now?
Ben Wyatt,"Because I'm finally doing what I love, and I know how hard it is to get to that place."
Ben Wyatt,"And I want you to be happy, because you're my friend."
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,I've never cared for you.
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait."
Ben Wyatt,You're behaving very strangely.
Donna Meagle,Saturn's Return.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Brokemons."
Jeremy Jamm,I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today.
Jeremy Jamm,You are my two all-time best friends.
Jeremy Jamm,And you brought me back from the brink.
Jeremy Jamm,"So, I can't choose sides."
Jeremy Jamm,"Although, if I had to pick one side, it would be Lucy Liu's backside."
Leslie Knope,"Without Jamm, the vote's two-two."
Leslie Knope,This was all for nothing.
Ron Swanson,I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all."
Leslie Knope,You didn't have to do that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Back to work, to figure out how to destroy you."
Ron Swanson,Same.
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Lucy,"Dude, thank you so much for this."
Lucy,I really owe you one.
Tom Haverford,"No, you don't."
Tom Haverford,You're smart and qualified and we're totally lucky to have you.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's do this."
