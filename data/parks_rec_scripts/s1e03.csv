Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat."
Jerry Gergich,See all the spikes?
Jerry Gergich,"So, two things."
Jerry Gergich,"One, it's poisonous."
Jerry Gergich,"And two, it would hurt."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department has so many programs.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.
Leslie Knope,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant."
Jerry Gergich,"Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee style."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, take a look at that."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,It's pretty and it smells good.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Smells great.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, it's really nice."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's bitter.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you don't eat it."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Why did you let me eat that?
Jerry Gergich,I never told you to eat that.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,God.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle."
Leslie Knope,I'm not an animal.
Leslie Knope,My tongue is swelling up.
Jerry Gergich,"No, don't touch it!"
Jerry Gergich,"No, you can't-- Okay, now you'll have to throw that away."
Leslie Knope,Let's not scare the kids.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, there we go then."
Jerry Gergich,Let's see what else is here.
Leslie Knope,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though."
Leslie Knope,So I have a piece of good news.
Leslie Knope,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.
Leslie Knope,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post."
Ann Perkins,That sounds really good.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It is a classic strategy.
Leslie Knope,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project."
Leslie Knope,The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.
Leslie Knope,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding."
Leslie Knope,"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises."
Leslie Knope,One penis in particular.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,"Rule number one, stay on message."
Leslie Knope,This is key.
Leslie Knope,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park."
Leslie Knope,And that's it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Number two: What?
Leslie Knope,Stay on message again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's that important."
Leslie Knope,It's one and two.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message and stay on message.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Stay on what, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,Message.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin."
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Did I ever get it?
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Buy you a cup of coffee?
Leslie Knope,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite."
Leslie Knope,The people who eat here basically run this town.
Leslie Knope,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,It's my first interview.
Mark Brendanawicz,What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I don't count that.
Leslie Knope,That was a smear job.
Leslie Knope,So I put together some discussion topics.
Leslie Knope,Can I run them by you?
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?
Leslie Knope,What is she gonna ask me first?
Mark Brendanawicz,How you spell your name.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Because of the silent ""K."""
Leslie Knope,You're so smart.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building--"
Mark Brendanawicz,How many discussion questions do you have there?
Leslie Knope,Um Thirty.
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Mark Brendanawicz,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I made love once.
Leslie Knope,And it was very intense.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,My ears are ringing.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna.
Leslie Knope,Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am familiar with your work."
Leslie Knope,I've read everything you've ever written.
Leslie Knope,You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Who left the door open?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,And I agree with you.
Leslie Knope,They are nature's bandits.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I was happy with that line.
Leslie Knope,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I've been here before.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A few times.
Leslie Knope,Quick tour?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.
Leslie Knope,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo."""
Leslie Knope,It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.
Leslie Knope,I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm surprised no one's complained about this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, tons of people have."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we get letters every day."
Leslie Knope,"This is Ron Swanson, our boss."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about."
Ron Swanson,No comment.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,About what?
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a three letter word."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best."
Tom Haverford,He beats me every time.
Tom Haverford,He kills me.
Tom Haverford,He's awesome.
Tom Haverford,I can't beat him.
Tom Haverford,I should just close my account.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford, boy genius."
Leslie Knope,Smooth like milk chocolate.
Tom Haverford,That's a weird way to describe me.
Leslie Knope,"April Ludgate, 19."
Leslie Knope,Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer."
Leslie Knope,They're the real heroes of this story.
Leslie Knope,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.
Leslie Knope,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's cool if I record this, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,That way it's verbatim.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,We can do all this on tape.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sure we can.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"And this is where you meet, generally?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Really?
Leslie Knope,We meet at a bunch of different places.
Leslie Knope,We don't always meet here.
Leslie Knope,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Because these are the real heroes.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna be in my office.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That's actually a great story.
Andy Dwyer,"I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons."
Andy Dwyer,"And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit."
Andy Dwyer,"And I was like, ""Maybe I should get that."""
Andy Dwyer,And I fell in and broke my legs.
Leslie Knope,Such a tragedy.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I was pretty wasted.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,You were drunk?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Totally.
Andy Dwyer,You knew that.
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know that, no."
Ann Perkins,"You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital."
Andy Dwyer,I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now."
Andy Dwyer,Like you're perfect.
Andy Dwyer,You're on the pill.
Andy Dwyer,You drink all the time.
Ann Perkins,You're allowed to do that.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's not that bad, right?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.
Leslie Knope,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I just got your 15 texts."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,I tried to stay on message.
Mark Brendanawicz,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me."
Leslie Knope,Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all."
Leslie Knope,Please fix it.
Tom Haverford,"April, let me ask you something."
Tom Haverford,Do you think I'm in the top five best looking Indian guys in Pawnee?
April Ludgate,No.
Tom Haverford,Who do you think's got me beat?
Tom Haverford,That guy Hashish at City Planning?
Ron Swanson,Tommy boy.
Ron Swanson,"Let me tell you something, Tom."
Ron Swanson,You suck at Scrabble.
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,You're destroying me.
Ron Swanson,"You're worse than my exwife, and she's terrible at Scrabble."
Ron Swanson,And she's a bitch.
Tom Haverford,"Look out, man."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get you one of these days.
Tom Haverford,I'm practicing.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I doubt that."
Ron Swanson,Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I have to go.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll have a photographer meet us there.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,See you then.
Leslie Knope,Disaster averted.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"That was easy, right?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can we go in your car?
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,All right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,'Cause I hate driving.
Leslie Knope,There's a beautiful view from over there.
Leslie Knope,This is a great place to take a shot.
Leslie Knope,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no problem."
Leslie Knope,Do you live near Mark?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"No, not at all."
Leslie Knope,So he gave you a ride somehow?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You know, do you have a pen?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cause I don't--
Leslie Knope,"No, sorry."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?"
Extra,"I might, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional."
Leslie Knope,She got here 15 minutes late. She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.
Leslie Knope,And she had to get a ride from--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So how big is this lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, how big is--"
Leslie Knope,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,How big is the lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The lot?
Leslie Knope,How big is what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,How big is the lot?
Leslie Knope,A hundred or something.
Leslie Knope,Give or take 100.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A hundred what?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't I guess I don't know anything.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,I have to get something from my car.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.
April Ludgate,"I just played ""lexicons"" for a billion points."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no, no."
April Ludgate,What?
Tom Haverford,"I was letting him win, dumbass."
April Ludgate,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"""Lateral, communal, zonal""?"
Tom Haverford,"You dropped a ""Z"" in there?"
Tom Haverford,April.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So when did you start at the Parks Department?
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was a few years ago."
Leslie Knope,My mother got me the job.
Leslie Knope,I was qualified.
Leslie Knope,It's not like it was nepotism.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a stick.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism."
Leslie Knope,"But-- Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"No, it wasn't."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's not you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just I'm exhausted.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I got, like, zero sleep last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So--
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You're home.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm home."
Leslie Knope,"I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was going perfect."
Leslie Knope,"But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Ann Perkins,So how'd it go?
Ann Perkins,"She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just your kind of standard questions."
Leslie Knope,There was one annoying thing.
Leslie Knope,She and Mark had sex with each other.
Ann Perkins,You're kidding.
Leslie Knope,"I wish I was, but I'm not."
Leslie Knope,They did it.
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.
Andy Dwyer,Who had sex?
Ann Perkins,That guy Mark and the reporter.
Andy Dwyer,Called it.
Andy Dwyer,I called that.
Andy Dwyer,You remember that?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"He did, actually."
Ann Perkins,He totally called that.
Leslie Knope,Why do men have to behave like this?
Leslie Knope,Why can't they be professionals?
Andy Dwyer,Men are dogs.
Ann Perkins,"You know, maybe they really like each other."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't like her.
Andy Dwyer,He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,God.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, come on."
Andy Dwyer,Men do that.
Andy Dwyer,It's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should go talk to him."
Leslie Knope,Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Definitely, you should talk to him."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,I bet he didn't use a condom.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mark."
Leslie Knope,May I come into your office?
Leslie Knope,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.
Leslie Knope,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.
Leslie Knope,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's personal.
Leslie Knope,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.
Leslie Knope,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have sex with her and"
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna say something.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't want you to take it the wrong way.
Mark Brendanawicz,But you're being a huge dork.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then I resign from your subcommittee."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation--"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Leslie?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hi."
Leslie Knope,I accidentally ate an old burrito.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Leslie Knope,I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,"So, I was hoping we could have a do over interview."
Leslie Knope,Maybe over lunch.
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, I guess I'm free."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm assuming not Mexican.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Because of the burrito.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu."
Leslie Knope,"So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, you seemed a little weird."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wouldn't say weird."
Leslie Knope,"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?
Leslie Knope,Can I say over 100%?
Leslie Knope,Because I would be lying if I said less.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Wow.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can I read you some of these quotes?
Leslie Knope,Be my guest.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""The Sullivan Street pit is always going to be a pit."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, until it turns into a park."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, because they're more likely to exist than this park."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Tell that to a 14 year old girl.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on the Pope getting married, because that's more likely to happen than this park."""
Leslie Knope,There are some countries where the Pope can be married.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on talking monkeys."""
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Have you seen The Wizard of Oz?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about leprechauns."""
Leslie Knope,Leprechauns exist.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about the sun falling out of the sky."""
Leslie Knope,Why would you write an article about that?
Leslie Knope,That's--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"This one is just ""No."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""This park is never, ever, ever, ever going to happen."""
Leslie Knope,Might I ask who said that?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Mark Brendanawicz.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Can I talk to you for a second?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, what's up?"
Ann Perkins,You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why is this a big deal to anybody?
Ann Perkins,"Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I didn't say anything to her.
Ann Perkins,"""The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built?"""
Mark Brendanawicz,But that stuff was off the record.
Ann Perkins,Did you say it was off the record?
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have to say it's off the record?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for meeting us.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, yeah."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,My editor loves it.
Ann Perkins,"You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park--"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't understand.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You did say it, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Technically.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Technically?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, ""Come on, stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,And then I came back to bed.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it."
Ann Perkins,That's great.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You're welcome.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, going forward."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Tom Haverford,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I don't know what to tell you, man."
Tom Haverford,April got on my computer.
Tom Haverford,Password was saved.
Tom Haverford,She played a couple of Scrabble words.
Tom Haverford,It wasn't me.
Tom Haverford,I don't even know what lexicons are.
Tom Haverford,I thought that was a luxury automobile.
Tom Haverford,You're the word king.
Tom Haverford,She was probably cheating.
Ron Swanson,I knew that couldn't have been you.
Ron Swanson,You don't have the vocabulary.
Tom Haverford,I know.
Ron Swanson,You can't even spell vocabulary.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,V-O-G-X Was that right? No.
Ron Swanson,We're cool.
Ron Swanson,I'm not an idiot.
Ron Swanson,I know Tom has been losing to me on purpose.
Ron Swanson,But I like Tom.
Ron Swanson,He doesn't do a lot of work around here.
Ron Swanson,He shows zero initiative.
Ron Swanson,He's not a team player.
Ron Swanson,He's never one to go that extra mile.
Ron Swanson,Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, you busy?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy."
Mark Brendanawicz,I wanted to apologize to you.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I never should've done anything with that reporter.
Tom Haverford,Whoa! You nailed Malwae-Tweep? Nice.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again."
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Tom Haverford,So she's available.
Mark Brendanawicz,I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you were right, and I should've listened to you."
Mark Brendanawicz,I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate you trying."
Leslie Knope,Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,You'll have my answer within the month.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Park's gonna get done.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz."
Mark Brendanawicz,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thanks, a lot."
Leslie Knope,Thank you a lot.
Tom Haverford,"Man, that dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag."
Leslie Knope,"""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street has been proposed as the site of a new park."""
Leslie Knope,That part's good.
Leslie Knope,I think we stayed on message for that part.
