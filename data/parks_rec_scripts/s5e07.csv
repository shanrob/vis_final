Ben Wyatt,"Oh, just remembered."
Ben Wyatt,I kind of got you an engagement present.

Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's a little better than that."
Joe Biden,Claudia Welders.

Joe Biden,"No, it's happening, and I'm delighted to have you here."
Joe Biden,"On behalf of the president and myself, I wanted to"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. vice president, I am deeply flattered, but there's no way that I could take over Madam Secretary Clinton's position."
Joe Biden,"I mean I'm confident you could do that job or any other, but"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I will."
Joe Biden,"Well, the reason you're here is I'm told you've done such a great job in your town and in the state of Indiana, and I just want to say congratulations for your public service."
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say thank you.
Joe Biden,"Well, you you're very welcome."

Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, Mr."
Ben Wyatt,Vice President.
Joe Biden,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"You don't let anything happen to him, you understand me?"
Leslie Knope,He is precious cargo.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's actually the same accounting firm I almost joined last year, and they gave me a great package Three weeks of vacation, matching 401(K), and a pretty sweet windbreaker."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm getting married, and I wanted a good stable job, so I'm going back to Accounting."
Ben Wyatt,"So just call me Bond, municipal bond."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that joke killed at the accounting firm."
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Mr. Looks and Professor Books.
Tom Haverford,He's Looks.
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"Of course you do, Books."
Tom Haverford,What's going on?
Chris Traeger,"Well, fun fact: Ben just got an amazing accounting job."
Chris Traeger,Regular fact: I have to go to a meeting.
Chris Traeger,Unfun fact: My Uncle just had a stroke.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm off."
Tom Haverford,This is actually a crazy coincidence.
Tom Haverford,I have a new company and could use your help on the math side of things.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, what's the new company?"
Tom Haverford,We specialize in making stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Pass.
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,It's a real idea.
Tom Haverford,"So get this Kids are always growing out of their clothes, so their parents don't want to buy 'em nice things."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna rent my upscale clothing to middle school kids, because I discovered I'm roughly the same size as the average Pawnee 12 year old."
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a really great idea.
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,"Can you take a look at the business plan, tell me what do you think?"
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
April Ludgate,"Washington, D.C."
April Ludgate,has more dog parks per capita than most cities.
April Ludgate,"Pawnee only has two dog parks this one and that one, which is also an active parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Can you say ""per capita"" again?"
Leslie Knope,"I want to take a picture of you saying ""per capita."""
April Ludgate,Stop.
Leslie Knope,I am so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.
April Ludgate,Gross.
Leslie Knope,April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry."
Leslie Knope,And here we go.
Leslie Knope,One tiny critique.
Leslie Knope,"If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself."
April Ludgate,"No, this is publicity for Orin's new performance art show."
April Ludgate,He's an animal living on a human farm.
April Ludgate,And you can go and feed him from your own hand.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin."
Leslie Knope,You should not be friends with him.
April Ludgate,"So, after reviewing all the options, I found that the best location for the dog park is Lot 48, the one behind Ann's house."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I've been trying to put a park there for four years.
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine."
Leslie Knope,"I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs."
Leslie Knope,"What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't that sound fun?
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, cheese."
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Jerry Gergich,"Good morning, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, something is different about my computer."
Andy Dwyer,Aha.
Andy Dwyer,It's gone.
Andy Dwyer,A game is the foot.
Andy Dwyer,"See, part of the police academy entrance exam is investigating a crime."
Andy Dwyer,"So about a month ago I told everyone in the office that, at some point, they should steal something from my desk so I could practice."
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, hey, did you guys take my glasses too?"
Andy Dwyer,They got my sunglasses too.
Donna Meagle,I was in Miami last weekend.
Donna Meagle,I took my talents to South Beach.
Andy Dwyer,How do you spend your time in Miami?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe fencing stolen computers?
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I took your government computer from Indiana to Miami to sell it on the black market for 150 bucks."
Andy Dwyer,"Haha, you don't know it, but you just gave yourself away."
Ben Wyatt,"Gotta say, I'm impressed."
Ben Wyatt,"Your mission statement made sense, and you didn't use one R. Kelly lyric."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,So you want to be my CFO?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I already have a job, but I'll help as a friend."
Ben Wyatt,As long as you take what I say seriously.
Ben Wyatt,I don't want another Entertainment 720 disaster on our hands.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it was a disaster."
Tom Haverford,Too bad we didn't see it coming.
Tom Haverford,"All right, what's my first move?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place."
Leslie Knope,"It just has a really good energy here, you know?"
Leslie Knope,lots of natural light.
April Ludgate,It's tiny and awful and loud.
April Ludgate,"And it's zone 14B, industrial waste cleanup site."
April Ludgate,We should technically be wearing Hazmat suits right now.
Ann Perkins,It seems like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I had that exact doll when I was a kid.
Ann Perkins,This is this is traumatic for me.
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry, but lot 48 is the only one that works."
April Ludgate,And I'm definitely bringing it up at the next city council meeting.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Saw off your pinky toe.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Shave your head.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Have sex with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,"Well, I tried to be reasonable."
Leslie Knope,I have created a monster.
Leslie Knope,And now I need to destroy her.
Leslie Knope,"What do I do, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"God, he's good."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me."
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Ron Swanson,You just walked in here and started talking.
Leslie Knope,I don't have time for a history lesson.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it."
Ron Swanson,Which guy?
Leslie Knope,Ricky Jordache.
Ron Swanson,Never heard of him.
Ron Swanson,What's his deal?
Leslie Knope,He's new.
Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?"
Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky."
Leslie Knope,Here's my question.
Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?
Ron Swanson,Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.
Ron Swanson,I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.
Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing."
Ron Swanson,"And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles."
Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?
Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.
Ron Swanson,Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything."
Ron Swanson,Everybody has something they're passionate about.
Ron Swanson,"Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention."
Extra,"Howdy, neighbors."
Extra,Welcome to human farm.
Extra,Here's your animal feed.
Extra,Please don't feed the animals.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is really, really cool."
Leslie Knope,"I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's actually about death and the city."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I see that now.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin."
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between RentASwag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial."
Jessica Wicks,"Well, I must say it's a much better idea than the last one you had, that gourmet French food thing."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail."
Tom Haverford,So you want to partner up and make history?
Tom Haverford,"I mean, you've already made history as the world's most beautiful CEO."
Jessica Wicks,"I'm really sorry, cutie."
Jessica Wicks,The company's laying low right now due to a small mishap.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, yes."
Ben Wyatt,"The Sweetums molasses storage vat exploded, resulting in a slow moving ecological disaster."
Tom Haverford,"Well, all press is good press."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this was bad press."
Ben Wyatt,A lot of homes were very gradually flooded.
Jessica Wicks,People died.
Jessica Wicks,"Actually, speaking of, we're starting up a nonprofit foundation to restore our name."
Jessica Wicks,Any interest in running it?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm I'm sorry, you want me to run your nonprofit wing?"
Jessica Wicks,"I know that Bobby Newport is my stepson, but the work you did on Leslie's campaign was amazing."
Jessica Wicks,Your name is on our short list.
Tom Haverford,"Just to clarify, it's a no to me on all fronts, and you're offering Ben a job?"
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Been looking at your file all day, Jerry if that even is your real name."
Jerry Gergich,It's not.
Jerry Gergich,My real name is Gary.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, Gary if that even is your real name Somebody stole my computer."
Andy Dwyer,"Now, if you're a criminal, look at me, you have to tell me legally, or else it's considered entrapment."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Andy."
Jerry Gergich,It wasn't me.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, really?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me."
Andy Dwyer,I can never tell when people are lying to me.
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.
Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program."
Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.
April Ludgate,I'm not stupid.
Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?
April Ludgate,It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.
April Ludgate,You hate this show.
Leslie Knope,I love this show.
April Ludgate,What's your favorite part?
Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.
April Ludgate,"You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now."
Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?
April Ludgate,"Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it."
April Ludgate,He thinks it's a great idea.
April Ludgate,"He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars."
Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now."
Orin,Moo.
Orin,Moo.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?
Orin,No.
Orin,You are.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shut up."
Ben Wyatt,Tom would make a great profile for your show.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is a guy who's learned through an unbelievable series of bonehead business moves."
Tom Haverford,"Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling."
Extra,"It's interesting, but I think I need to wait until the business has been around for a few months, make sure it's viable."
Extra,"You're the guy who ran the congressional campaign in Washington, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"What, are you gonna offer him a job?"
Extra,Yes.
Extra,"We're launching a new political chat show, and we need correspondents."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you, but I'm a little shaky on live TV."
Extra,That's okay.
Extra,People want authenticity.
Extra,Think about it?
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear him?
Tom Haverford,He stinks on TV.
Tom Haverford,He sweats.
Tom Haverford,He stutters.
Tom Haverford,"It's like The King's Speech, but the first part, before he's fixed."
Extra,That was my favorite part of the movie.
Tom Haverford,What is happening?
Andy Dwyer,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Yup.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I know you did it.
Chris Traeger,Did what?
Andy Dwyer,Don't play stupid and handsome with me.
Andy Dwyer,You stole my computer so that I could practice for my police exam.
Andy Dwyer,You're as guilty as you are sexy.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, another computer was reported stolen from the offices on the other side of the courtyard."
Chris Traeger,I don't think this is part of your police training.
Chris Traeger,I think City Hall was robbed.
Andy Dwyer,I can't tell if you're lying to me.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Chris Traeger,I think.
Andy Dwyer,Like a real crime?
Andy Dwyer,That's even better.
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business: It's agenda item 280B, a motion to construct a dog park on municipal lot 48."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, you have the floor."
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Councilman Jamm."
April Ludgate,Your help and general nonawfulness is much appreciated.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, members of the Council, I believe that municipal lot 48 should be a dog park."
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,I just heard one hag booing.
Councilman Howser,"Ladies, please, let's keep this civil."
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman, Pawneeans, satisfied customers of Jamm Orthodontics, as we discuss what type of park to put on lot 48, I had a thought."
Jeremy Jamm,How about no park?
Jeremy Jamm,Who here thinks parks are stupid?
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.
Jeremy Jamm,"I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location."
Jeremy Jamm,"Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit."
Jeremy Jamm,You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.
April Ludgate,You told me you wanted a dog park.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, psych."
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
April Ludgate,You lied to me.
Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.
Leslie Knope,I hate when he says that.
Leslie Knope,I told you that Jamm was a snake.
April Ludgate,"Well, it takes a snake to know a snake."
Leslie Knope,So now I'm a snake?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"You deceived me for two straight days, and you eat mice."
Leslie Knope,I don't eat mice.
April Ludgate,"Yes, you do."
April Ludgate,You're a mouse eater.
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
Ron Swanson,Enough!
Ron Swanson,You are friends and coworkers.
Ron Swanson,"In this office, we treat each other with respect."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, how is that dog park coming?"
April Ludgate,"Get out, Jerry."
Ann Perkins,This is private!
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, guys."
Ann Perkins,We are not leaving here until you two figure this out.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, guard the door."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, sir."
Ann Perkins,No one leaves the Octagon.
Ann Perkins,I dated an ultimate fighter.
Ann Perkins,It was like a thing he said.
Andy Dwyer,"What's the play here, officer?"
Andy Dwyer,"You gonna set up a perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I know."
Andy Dwyer,"We could put out a dummy computer for them to steal, fill it with explosives first, Boom, take 'em all out."
Extra,"Yeah, we're not doing any of that."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation."
Andy Dwyer,You're just gonna fill out this stupid report and that's it?
Andy Dwyer,"As a future cop, you have to understand, I cannot let this guy go."
Extra,"Look, man, this is what most police work is."
Extra,Just writing stuff down.
Extra,It's not superhero time.
Extra,"If it sounds boring, maybe you ought to do something else."
Chris Traeger,Maybe we should find the person who stole his positive attitude.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,Get any more job offers since I last saw you?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters."
Ben Wyatt,I turned it down.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can't hack this.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my accounting job isn't boring."
Tom Haverford,"If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it."
Tom Haverford,They have a show about storage unit auctions.
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, if you're passionate about this, keep at it."
Ben Wyatt,Things will turn around.
Ben Wyatt,Also can you tell me what time that show about storage units is on?
Tom Haverford,9:30
Ann Perkins,"All right, I'm gonna have to force this."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, maybe you want to admit that you haven't been the greatest role model."
April Ludgate,I don't care.
April Ludgate,Orin's my role model.
Ann Perkins,"April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate."
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry that I outsmarted you at every turn.
Ann Perkins,April.
April Ludgate,"And I know I have a lot to learn from you, and I'm sorry that I disrespected your stupid dream."
Ann Perkins,A lot of love in this room.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
April Ludgate,Me too.
Leslie Knope,I love you very much.
April Ludgate,I love you too.
April Ludgate,I don't want to do this in front of her.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?"
Ann Perkins,"Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good."
Ann Perkins,"So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,We'll have triple sex with him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move."
April Ludgate,I love it.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Captain."
Andy Dwyer,Status update: My new suspect the dude who runs carpet emporium.
Andy Dwyer,"The way I figure it is, criminals love to wrap things up in rugs."
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, he yelled at me when I tried to unroll 'em all, so"
Chris Traeger,"Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?"
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty."
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, maybe I should bail on being a cop."
Chris Traeger,City Hall needs a new parttime security guard for the weekends.
Chris Traeger,You want to do that?
Chris Traeger,Look at it as a way to feel out whether you want to be a police officer.
Chris Traeger,"But, keep in mind, if you take this job, you must keep your clothes on at all times, even if you get sad."
Andy Dwyer,No deal.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'll do it."
Chris Traeger,That a boy.
Andy Dwyer,I'll do it.
Andy Dwyer,I promise.
Andy Dwyer,"And I get a gun, and I can point it in people's faces."
Chris Traeger,Incorrect.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey.
Jeremy Jamm,What the hell is going on?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area."
Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.
Jeremy Jamm,My front lawn?
April Ludgate,"That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, hey, lady, get that thing off my gnome."
Jeremy Jamm,He is dryhumping my garden gnome.
Jeremy Jamm,Stupid beast.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park."
Leslie Knope,"And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life."
Jeremy Jamm,I'll call the police.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, sic the police on a bunch of kids and puppies."
Ann Perkins,That's a great photo op.
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,Gentleman's agreement.
Jeremy Jamm,"In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote."
Jeremy Jamm,Winner take all.
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Jeremy Jamm,"Great, now call off the actual dogs."
Jeremy Jamm,I want these kids off my lawn.
Jeremy Jamm,I want that hula hoop off my 'Vette.
Jeremy Jamm,Right now.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,You just got knoped.
Leslie Knope,And ludgated.
Leslie Knope,And perkinsed.
Jeremy Jamm,Ha-ha.
Jeremy Jamm,Nice try.
Jeremy Jamm,It didn't work.
Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get to work."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, do you never just take a second to enjoy things?"
Leslie Knope,"I just said, ""let's get to work."""
Leslie Knope,How else do people enjoy things?
Barney,"I know you changed your mind the last time we offered you a job, but we are just thrilled that you changed it again."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Me too.
Barney,This is our best office.
Barney,"As you can see through the window, you have a great view of the billing department."
Barney,"Hey, Sharon!"
Extra,Shh.
Barney,Sorry.
Barney,She's fun.
Barney,"So, please, if there's anything we can do to make you happier in your new job, just let me know."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, this is great, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,But I have to quit again.
Barney,What
Barney,ohh! Is this a classic Ben joke?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt,But I just don't want to do this.
Ben Wyatt,I need to move my life in another direction.
Barney,This is disappointing.
Barney,Again.
Barney,Maybe someday we'll figure out the magic formula that gets you to work here.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, formulas are my formula for moolah."
Barney,"Ted, get in here! Ben's quitting again, but you gotta hear what he said."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie's been saying for weeks I should do something I love, and she's right."
Ben Wyatt,And I'll help Tom or maybe try to do that TV thing or maybe work for the Sweetums foundation.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,Life is short.
Ben Wyatt,"Why be an accountant, you know? I mean, other than the stability and the health plan and the above-average pay."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, this better work out."
