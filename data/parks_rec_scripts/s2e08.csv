Ron Swanson,"""Thank you, Old Gus, for brightening our lives, our hearts, and most importantly, our shoes."""
Leslie Knope,This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy."
Old Gus,"Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine."
Old Gus,"You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine."
Old Gus,"And just for the record, I never ever liked being called ""Old Gus."""
Old Gus,"I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now."
Old Gus,"So go to hell, every single one of you."
Old Gus,"Screw Pawnee, and screw your damn shoes."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,That's classic.
Leslie Knope,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification."
Leslie Knope,"April, stop that."
Leslie Knope,Who are you texting?
April Ludgate,You.
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,She's texting me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry you're bored.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, hey, everyone."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,Keep the momentum going.
Leslie Knope,Keep these minds working.
Tom Haverford,"Absolutely, chief."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Would you rather be able to fly, or speak fluent French?"
Tom Haverford,"Donna, go."
Donna Meagle,French.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48."
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,The library?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,"They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's gonna be okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not a done deal.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for pulling me out of there.
Leslie Knope,"I need a good plan, though."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't wanna cause a panic."
Leslie Knope,"News flash, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,We got a big problem with the library.
Tom Haverford,Punkass book jockeys.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Why do we hate the library?
Leslie Knope,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.
Leslie Knope,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.
All,What?
Donna Meagle,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,On 48?
Ann Perkins,I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.
April Ludgate,Let's bring the library down.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,But I'm not about to say that in there.
Tom Haverford,A new branch?
Leslie Knope,Jerks.
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I hate them."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need to make contact with someone there.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, we actually kind of do."
Mark Brendanawicz,The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Ron's ex-wife?
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,Or is that awful?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her."
Leslie Knope,Everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,Or is it just the same?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you're thinking out loud again."
Leslie Knope,Am I?
Leslie Knope,I am.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,That bitch of an ex-wife is working for the library now.
Ron Swanson,That is perfect.
Ron Swanson,The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.
Leslie Knope,I have to go talk to her.
Leslie Knope,And you got to give me something I can use.
Leslie Knope,Does she have any weaknesses?
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, no?"
Leslie Knope,Everybody has a weakness.
Ron Swanson,Not machines.
Ron Swanson,I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.
Leslie Knope,I see.
Leslie Knope,"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,I hate them both.
Ron Swanson,"On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time."
Ron Swanson,Would I get married again?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.
Leslie Knope,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings."
Leslie Knope,This one will tear you up.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I called a little while ago.
Tammy 2,You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Tammy 2,"You have overdue book fees totaling 3 dollars, missy."
Leslie Knope,That is so typical.
Leslie Knope,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that."
Tammy 2,No--
Leslie Knope,That's why everybody hates the library.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,Here's your 3 dollars.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, no--"
Leslie Knope,And I'll see you in hell.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie."
Tammy 2,I'm just kidding.
Tammy 2,"My gosh, I mean, you did have 3 dollars worth of fines, but I cleared them."
Tammy 2,"We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?"
Leslie Knope,I know this is a trap.
Leslie Knope,But I don't know how.
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,Did you talk to Ron?
Tammy 2,Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.
Tammy 2,I swear I don't have cloven feet.
Tammy 2,Please.
Tammy 2,Sit down.
Andy Dwyer,"Shine, shine, shine your shoes."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say, sir?"
Andy Dwyer,Ma'am?
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?
Andy Dwyer,I won't look up your skirt.
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,It's me.
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"So, Ann, how you been?"
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I just joined the rat race."
Andy Dwyer,Chasing the cheese.
Andy Dwyer,"Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese."
Andy Dwyer,Enough technical business talk.
Andy Dwyer,You look ravishing.
Ann Perkins,"Not a lot of customers, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, business is a little slow."
Andy Dwyer,It is definitely due to the economy.
Andy Dwyer,I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,You want those shoes shined?
Andy Dwyer,I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's."
Andy Dwyer,Not for long.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sorry?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,At least he finally has a real job.
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal."
Leslie Knope,"I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play."
Tammy 2,Wow.
Tammy 2,"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the goal, Tammy."
Tammy 2,"Listen, you guys got there first."
Tammy 2,"I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you."
Tammy 2,"Government gals, right?"
Leslie Knope,Government gals.
Ron Swanson,So you talked to Tammy?
Ron Swanson,What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?
Leslie Knope,"She's changed, Ron."
Leslie Knope,She's a different person.
Leslie Knope,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.
Leslie Knope,Look at Mark and me.
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,"We talked about it, we're still friends."
Ron Swanson,You slept with Brendanawicz?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tammy and I don't work."
Ron Swanson,We are oil and water.
Ron Swanson,"Or oil, and TNT, and C4, and a detonator, and a butane torch."
Ron Swanson,Nothing good will come... Wait.
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Good start.
Tammy 2,"I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you."
Tammy 2,Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Tammy 2,"Thanks, Ron."
Tammy 2,It means a lot.
Tammy 2,You're a miracle worker.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Do you know what you just did?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.
Donna Meagle,You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.
Donna Meagle,I was.
Donna Meagle,Those two are crazy.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,And you just opened the gates to Crazytown.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what is he afraid of?"
Leslie Knope,Tammy's just a woman.
Leslie Knope,A nice woman.
Leslie Knope,"You know, she's not a murderer."
Leslie Knope,She's not a dragon.
Tammy 2,"It's really good to see you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,You've aged horribly.
Tammy 2,You son of a bitch.
Ron Swanson,That didn't take long.
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Tammy 2,What is your problem?
Tammy 2,"Nothing's changed, has it?"
Tammy 2,"Who set the bed on fire, huh?"
Waiter,"Excuse me, folks."
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,Is that what you wanna hear?
Waiter,"Please, folks."
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,I'm so sorry.
Waiter,Please.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Take it easy.
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God, yes."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, wow."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Waiter,Sir.
Waiter,Ma'am.
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, yes."
Tammy 2,Baby.
Tammy 2,Gun it.
Tammy 2,The usual place.
Ron Swanson,Have Gun Will Travel reads the card of a man A knight without armor in a savage land.
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,That is a beautiful sweater vest.
Ron Swanson,April.
Ron Swanson,You look like you could use 20 dollars.
Ron Swanson,Am I right?
April Ludgate,Why?
Ron Swanson,"'Cause you're a kid, and kids always need money."
Tom Haverford,I need money.
Ron Swanson,Ha!
Ron Swanson,"That's why you're my favorite, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"When Tiger Woods feels invincible, he wears a red shirt and black pants."
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Deputy."
Tom Haverford,Ron wears the same thing after he's had sex.
Ron Swanson,I'm a simple man.
Ron Swanson,"I like pretty, dark haired women and breakfast food."
Ron Swanson,But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real.
Ron Swanson,"Today, I got the real thing."
Ron Swanson,A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning.
Ron Swanson,I should have taken a picture of it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Mark Brendanawicz,My girlfriend's ex is working 100 feet away from my desk and he's been pretty clear about wanting her back.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do I do with that?
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,That's a tough one.
Tom Haverford,"You should break up with her, and tell her to go out with me."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I ask you another question?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why did I come to you for advice?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"I think you should play this one cool, man."
Tom Haverford,Be the grown-up.
Tom Haverford,Take the high road.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Ann's a classy chick.
Tom Haverford,"If you get down in the mud, you're just gonna lose her respect."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You've just made a surprising amount of sense, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,I've never taken the high road.
Tom Haverford,But I tell other people to.
Tom Haverford,'Cause then there's more room for me on the low road.
Leslie Knope,"So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?"
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't thank you enough for sticking your nose where it didn't belong."
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,So what did you guys talk about?
Leslie Knope,Old times?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love talking about old times."
Leslie Knope,"New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?"
Ron Swanson,We didn't talk.
Ron Swanson,We made love.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, spare me the details."
Leslie Knope,I'm just happy.
Ron Swanson,"It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began."
Ron Swanson,You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have that."
Ron Swanson,The two of us.
Ron Swanson,"It's like doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours."
Leslie Knope,"This seems like a private matter, but I'm so--"
Ron Swanson,That woman really knows her way around a penis.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee."
Leslie Knope,I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.
Leslie Knope,I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.
Tom Haverford,They're reading their old divorce papers.
Tammy 2,"""Three fistfuls of hair."""
Tammy 2,That's not even possible.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm too classy to say ""I told you so,"" Donna."
Leslie Knope,So I wrote it on a Post-it.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Ron Swanson,"I mean, you spend so much time worrying about this park, but really, who cares?"
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,I care a lot.
Leslie Knope,"It's kind of my thing, remember?"
Ron Swanson,"But at the end of the day, what does it matter if the lot becomes a park, or a museum, or a megachurch?"
Leslie Knope,Or a library.
Ron Swanson,"Nobody said ""library."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I swear on a grave.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me the truth."
Leslie Knope,Are you giving her the lot?
Ron Swanson,Not giving.
Ron Swanson,We have discussed a trade.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Ron Swanson,Moreâ¦
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Ron Swanson,More sex.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about Ron.
Leslie Knope,You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, that's crazy."
Tammy 2,And correct.
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Tammy 2,"Les, there are two kinds of women in this world."
Tammy 2,There are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing.
Tammy 2,And then there are women who are cool.
Tammy 2,You could either be a Cleopatra or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt.
Tammy 2,I'd rather be Cleopatra.
Leslie Knope,What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?
Tammy 2,Haven't you ever messed with a man's head just to see what you could get him to do for you?
Tammy 2,We do it all the time in the Library Department.
Tammy 2,You should come join us sometime.
Leslie Knope,I would never work at the Library Department.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over."
Tammy 2,Okey-doke.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you better run."
Leslie Knope,We're no longer government gals.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, no."
Leslie Knope,The Planning Department Reprioritization Document?
Ron Swanson,"Calm down, I haven't signed it yet."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, you're going to."
Leslie Knope,"Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants."
Ron Swanson,She made some really good points about libraries.
Leslie Knope,Are you even listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,You're defending the library now?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the library?"
Leslie Knope,"Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?"
Ron Swanson,Some people like libraries.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
Leslie Knope,"""Some people like libraries."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, she's in your head."
Leslie Knope,"You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Tammy's changed.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye.
Ron Swanson,"I'm so screwed, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Her hooks are in my brain.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Ron Swanson,She has all the power and I have nothing.
Ron Swanson,I'm so little.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you just break up with her?
Ron Swanson,I don't think I can.
Ron Swanson,"We would just end up naked, and I'd give her your lot, and my house, and God knows what else."
Ron Swanson,I have no control over my actions.
Ron Swanson,It's like she's crawled up inside of me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Now sack up.
Leslie Knope,You are Ron freaking Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Not around her, I'm not."
Ron Swanson,"It took years of intense, focused hatred to get over her, and now I've undone all that great work."
Ron Swanson,You've got to help me break up with her.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I should get involved in this.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, now you don't wanna get involved?"
Ron Swanson,"""It's just coffee, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"""She's changed, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"""I let Mark nail me and we're still friends."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I would never use those words.
Leslie Knope,I never said-- Point taken.
Leslie Knope,Let's go dump your ex.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?"
Ron Swanson,In the room.
Ron Swanson,I don't want her to think I'm a wimp.
Leslie Knope,Here are the ground rules.
Leslie Knope,Don't talk to her.
Leslie Knope,Do not make eye contact with her.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe anything she says.
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, like a potted plant."
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have any--
Andy Dwyer,Mark.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, how's the shoeshine game?"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm on a break, one of the many advantages of owning your own business."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know that's not your situation, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Quick question.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is trying to decide between Mark and myself.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, she's not."
Andy Dwyer,"If you had to choose, who would you choose?"
Andy Dwyer,"Right now, on the spot."
Donna Meagle,I'm not sure.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you spin around for me?
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,Can we talk privately?
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,Just out here.
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship."
Tammy 2,Wait a minute.
Tammy 2,Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?
Ron Swanson,She volunteered.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me."
Tammy 2,"What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake."
Leslie Knope,"No, he doesn't."
Tammy 2,I'm pretty sure he does.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,He's completely over you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I like you a lot as a dude.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I doubt it.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too."
Andy Dwyer,I like you as well.
Andy Dwyer,But I'm still in love with Ann.
Andy Dwyer,I couldn't have been more upfront about that.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is punching allowed on the high road?
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,She wins.
Ron Swanson,I can't resist her.
Leslie Knope,"God, Ron, you have to."
Tammy 2,Stay out of this.
Tammy 2,This is our relationship.
Tammy 2,He's my man.
Tammy 2,And we have something twisted and beautiful.
Tammy 2,Oh.
Tammy 2,You want Ron.
Tammy 2,That's what this is all about.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I had one dream."
Leslie Knope,"But no, no."
Tammy 2,"Baby, don't you see what's happening here? She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face."
Leslie Knope,"I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable."
Leslie Knope,"And you, Tammy, you make him miserable."
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Just, please, find a way to be happy."
Ron Swanson,Knope.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,Just sign the thing.
Ron Swanson,"No, Leslie, it's not okay."
Ron Swanson,You just put my needs in front of your own.
Ron Swanson,No woman has ever done that for me before.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure that's not true.
Ron Swanson,"You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs."
Ron Swanson,"If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"What the hell are you doing? ""Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I still have feelings for you."
Andy Dwyer,Okay? I said it.
Andy Dwyer,What do you want me to do? Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,And you might wanna take these pictures down.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Take those pictures down.
Andy Dwyer,What? Fine.
Ann Perkins,All of it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna.
Ann Perkins,Now.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Give me the bikini one.
Andy Dwyer,The teeny one?
Ann Perkins,Bikini one.
Leslie Knope,You didn't give her the lot.
Ron Swanson,Let's get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Is part of your mustache missing?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Just keep walking.
Leslie Knope,There's a push-pin in your face.
Ron Swanson,Leave it in.
Ron Swanson,Can't you walk faster?
Leslie Knope,My legs are shorter than yours.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,We had a good run.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for saving my future park.
Leslie Knope,I know that must've been hard for you.
Leslie Knope,"You didn't kill Tammy, did you?"
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid she can't be killed.
Ron Swanson,To exes.
Ron Swanson,May they always stay that way.
Ron Swanson,Tammy is a mean person.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You can do better than that.
Ron Swanson,She's a grade A bitch.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Ron Swanson,"Every time she laughs, an angel dies."
Ron Swanson,Even telemarketers avoid her.
Ron Swanson,Her birth was payback for the sins of man.
Ron Swanson,But you know the worst thing about her?
Leslie Knope,She works for the library.
Ron Swanson,She works for the library.
