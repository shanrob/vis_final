Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Jerry's having a heart attack.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, I didn't know that."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, you okay?"

Tom Haverford,"Is there anything else you need, J?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe some GasX?
Jerry Gergich,"Ha ha, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"How is he, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Ann Perkins,He's great.
Ann Perkins,He should be out of here in a day or two.
Tom Haverford,"Doctor, medically speaking, how would you describe what happened to Jerry?"
Dr. Harris,He had a mild heart attack.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but he also exhibited excessive flatulence."
Tom Haverford,Is there a term for having a heart attack while releasing so much gas?
Dr. Harris,Not really.
Dr. Harris,Gastrointestinal distress is common during a cardiac event.
Tom Haverford,I just want to hear the doctor say that Jerry had a fart attack.
Tom Haverford,Is that too much to ask?
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Jerry Gergich,"Look at all the balloons and the flowers and the food and my goodness, you're so sweet to come visit this often."
Dr. Harris,"Well, they did cause it."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That's okay.
Jerry Gergich,I'm glad this happened.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, I could do without the mess of hospital bills, but no, this was a wakeup call."
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna make some changes.
Jerry Gergich,I want at least another 30 years with Gayle and my girls.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, Jerry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You are gonna have the future that you've always planned.
Leslie Knope,Just leave it to us.

Andy Dwyer,"Babe, how much should I sell this hat for?"
April Ludgate,"I don't know, eight cents?"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, this is the hat I was wearing the first time I ever heard Vitalogy by Pearl Jam."
April Ludgate,"Oh, $900."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that sounds about right."

Ron Swanson,I am selling this table.
Ron Swanson,I made it.
April Ludgate,So when am I gonna meet your new lover?
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid things have hit a rough patch with Diane.
Ron Swanson,She was not pleased with my babysitting performance and left me a very loud message on my cell phone.
April Ludgate,I'm sure she'll get over it if you just say you're sorry though.
Ron Swanson,"I like Diane, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a whole family."
Ron Swanson,"If the kids ever wanted to come to my place, I'd have to take a whole week off work just to undo the alarms and tripwires."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, that's my name."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's my Chris Traeger box."
Ann Perkins,All these boxes represent stuff from different eras of exboyfriends.
Chris Traeger,Oh Here are those ankle weights I bought you that you liked so much.

Jennifer Barkley,"Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might be helpful if you told us why you want to be governor of Florida."
Extra,"Well, I guess you could say mine is the classic Florida success story."
Extra,"I went to SFU law school, I was working at a small firm in Orlando, and one day, bam, just like that, gator eats penis."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me?

Ben Wyatt,We're not in the business of losing elections.
Ben Wyatt,We can get you where you wanna go.
Morris,"I'm just saying, you should have put ""spoiler alert"" on all those Death Canoe tweets."
Morris,"Also, not safe for work."
Morris,"You know, a lot of what you wrote was really profane."
Donna Meagle,"That movie's 25 years old, Morris."
Donna Meagle,"And if you don't like how I tweet, don't follow me."
Morris,What are you doing now?
Morris,I'm talking to you.
Donna Meagle,I'm live tweeting this dumbass conversation.
Tom Haverford,You like that coat?
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,But $200?
Extra,It's used.
Tom Haverford,"I paid 150 for it, then added the scorpion."

Tom Haverford,"Um, watch me."
Diane Lewis,Got a minute?
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,II didn't expect to see you after the yelling that occurred.

Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the meeting?"
Ben Wyatt,Kurtzwilder wants me to run his campaign from Florida.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not exactly sure when the job would even starts, but it would probably mean putting our plans on hold."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, you know, obviously you gotta take it, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, I'm not making any decisions until we talk about this and everything it would mean."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm flying back to Washington."
