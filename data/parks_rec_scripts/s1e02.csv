Leslie Knope,"Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year."
Leslie Knope,I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.
Leslie Knope,And I'm an adult.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I forgot to do that."
Leslie Knope,Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.
Leslie Knope,"And if so, he's succeeding."
Leslie Knope,I don't think a single egg has been found yet.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep looking.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find one.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to see my mom.
Leslie Knope,She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.
Leslie Knope,She's my hero.
Leslie Knope,How do I explain her?
Leslie Knope,She's as respected as Mother Teresa.
Leslie Knope,"She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"In or out, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Doorway is creepy.
Leslie Knope,"Right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Choosing in.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do."
Leslie Knope,"But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,I just remembered something.
Leslie Knope,I have my own subcommittee now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure you've heard something about it.
Leslie Knope,People are talking about it.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. at the Smithfield Community Center."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm leading it."
Leslie Knope,It's no biggie.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it is."
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,You know-- You want to come?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, Geez."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You know how busy I am.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,That's why I fake invited you.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'll try to be there.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody's here."
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Mark Brendanawicz,Ow!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Metal.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's really loud.
Leslie Knope,Subcommittee members.
Leslie Knope,Are we prepared for tomorrow night?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, have you booked the hall yet?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, did you clear your schedule?"
Ann Perkins,I did.
Ann Perkins,I changed my shift.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon."
Mark Brendanawicz,It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.
Mark Brendanawicz,"They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
Leslie Knope,"I have a secret weapon, canvassing."
Leslie Knope,Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.
Leslie Knope,I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.
Leslie Knope,"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes."
Leslie Knope,And there were only 63 people in my class. Andy fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,I fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Mark Brendanawicz,Zero.
April Ludgate,A hundred.
Ann Perkins,Zero.
Leslie Knope,I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you probably won't need any."
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦. And this is our canvassing guide.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""If a person is a man, turn to page two."""
Tom Haverford,"""If the person looks like a celebrity, example, Jack Nicholson, use this to help your pitch."""
Tom Haverford,"""Example, 'You can't handle the pit.'"""
Tom Haverford,"""That's why we need to turn it into a park."""
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,This is really thorough.
Leslie Knope,Ann and I are a team.
Leslie Knope,You guys are a team.
Leslie Knope,"We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors."
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna win.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Win what?
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, someone's in there."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be fun.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Ann Perkins,"Excited, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, definitely."
Leslie Knope,Are you pumped up?
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Look humble.
Leslie Knope,But confident.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,We are representatives from your local government.
Leslie Knope,May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?
Extra,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,Positive response.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,That'd be a great idea.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,I actually live in the neighborhood So I could probably tell you a little bit about--
Leslie Knope,That's-- Go to section three.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Um, We are having a public forum tomorrow night."
Ann Perkins,"And it would be great if you could come, voice your strong support."
Extra,Tomorrow?
Extra,I can't.
Extra,I'm busy.
Extra,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and toâ¦"
Extra,Sorry.
Extra,"Good luck, though."
Extra,I'm all for a park.
Ann Perkins,Would it change your mind if we told you that--
Leslie Knope,She's gone.
Extra,"Yeah, a park, huh?"
Extra,That sounds like a really good idea.
Mark Brendanawicz,Great.
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra,"Now, is this park gonna have a playground or, you know, maybe a pool for the kids?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, how old are your kids?"
Extra,No kids.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't do that.
Extra,"Also, is the park gonna be at least 1,000 feet from my house?"
Extra,"Because, you know, I really can't move again."
Mark Brendanawicz,"April, please stand behind me."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all we've got.
Extra,No flier?
Mark Brendanawicz,Nope.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wow, man."
Mark Brendanawicz,This is great.
Mark Brendanawicz,This is so great.
Mark Brendanawicz,I love canvassing.
Mark Brendanawicz,What a great way to spend my time.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Team Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"You guys are awesome, but I think I might work better as a solo artist."
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm gonna head out."
Tom Haverford,Peace.
April Ludgate,He runs weird.
Mark Brendanawicz,He really does.
Extra,It's a good idea.
Extra,But I'm just not sure.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Which part are you not sure about?
Extra,Turning the pit into a park.
Ann Perkins,That's kind of the whole thing.
Extra,"Well, look, I think this is a great idea, but I can't make any forum."
Extra,I would have to get a babysitter.
Leslie Knope,How old are your kids?
Extra,Four and two.
Leslie Knope,Could the 4 year old watch the 2 year old?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Mickey!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, buddy?"
Tom Haverford,How's my number one sod man doing?
Tom Haverford,"Look, here's the one, two, three of the situation."
Tom Haverford,"One, we're building a new park, two, I'm on the committee, three, you're putting in the sod."
Tom Haverford,"And who knows, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"Maybe, down the line, a situation will arise where you could hook me up."
Tom Haverford,"Are you gonna commit to coming to this meeting tomorrow, or are you gonna be a bitch?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, you do owe me."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Keep going, keep moving."
Leslie Knope,Nose to the grindstone.
Leslie Knope,No means yes.
Ann Perkins,"Can we stop, please?"
Ann Perkins,"Because it's really hot, and I'm tired."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm hot, too."
Leslie Knope,Let's blow on each other's faces.
Leslie Knope,Or we could drink some water.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's do that."
Ann Perkins,My house is really close by.
Ann Perkins,Let's just go take a break for an hour or so.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder."
Leslie Knope,This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want."
Ann Perkins,"""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?"""
Ann Perkins,That seems iffy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
Leslie Knope,"Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?"
Extra,Oh.
Extra,"Actually, no."
Extra,I'm not really a fan of parks.
Extra,"Very noisy, barbecue smell all the time."
Leslie Knope,Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?
Extra,What?
Extra,How would you even know that?
Leslie Knope,Survey.
Leslie Knope,We surveyed crystal meth users.
Ann Perkins,We're actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to just--
Extra,"Look, I know it sounds weird, but I just don't like living near parks."
Extra,"So if you have a flier or something, I'd be happy to take it."
Extra,Thank you.
Extra,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!
Extra,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"It's-- What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too."
Extra,"So, if I don't support your little project, then I don't love my daughter?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't--
Extra,"What time is this thing, anyway?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's next month, forget about it."
Extra,"Oh, it's tomorrow night."
Extra,I'll be there.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Come on.
Leslie Knope,We got one.
Extra,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Am I talking to the two sexiest thighs in landscaping?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am, 'cause I'm talking to Marcy."
Tom Haverford,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Kevin, your sandboxes are the best."
Tom Haverford,That's why I want you involved!
Tom Haverford,I just want the best monkey bars I can get in my park.
Tom Haverford,I don't mind hooking you up.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe, down the line, there'll be a situation where you can hook me up."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for your time, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he said some upsetting things."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you gave him your home phone number.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a public servant."
Leslie Knope,I need to be accessible.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with people?
Ann Perkins,I should show them Andy's medical bills.
Ann Perkins,Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Game changer.
Leslie Knope,You just busted the game wide open.
Ann Perkins,How?
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,We need Andy.
Leslie Knope,He's our symbol.
Leslie Knope,We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.
Leslie Knope,He's a cute FDR.
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Paul,"Ron, you got a minute?"
Ron Swanson,"Uh, sure, Paul."
Ron Swanson,What can I do for you?
Paul,The Sullivan Street Park project.
Paul,"You fast-tracked it, right?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,We have a public forum tomorrow.
Paul,Okay.
Paul,Great.
Paul,I'll be there.
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"""Hey! You fast-tracked that, right?"""
Paul,I'm sorry?
Paul,Did you say something?
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Paul,You didn't say anything to me?
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,There's a new wind blowing in government and I don't like it.
Ron Swanson,"All of a sudden, there's all this federal money coming in, and Paul, the city manager, is telling us to build parks and start new community programs."
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?"
Ann Perkins,Costume?
Ann Perkins,"You mean, like, scrubs?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, put those on."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Please tell me, Please tell me why, My car is in the front yard, Bass!"
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night
Mark Brendanawicz,It can be tricky dealing
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?
Leslie Knope,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.
Leslie Knope,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there."
Leslie Knope,"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?"""
Leslie Knope,But not here.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.
Leslie Knope,And it is my dream to build a park.
Leslie Knope,That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.
Leslie Knope,"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome."""
Leslie Knope,"""Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States."""
Ron Swanson,"Leslie Knope, builder of parks."
Ron Swanson,How was canvassing?
Leslie Knope,"Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting."
Ron Swanson,Postpone?
Leslie Knope,Only for 1 to 90 days.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,You're doing this meeting.
Ron Swanson,You have my full support.
Ron Swanson,"I was talking to the city manager, exchanging ideas."
Ron Swanson,"Um, there's a mutual respect there."
Ron Swanson,"And together, we have decided to fast-track your project."
Leslie Knope,City manager?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I have to cancel this meeting.
Leslie Knope,Fast-track?
Leslie Knope,Did my name come up at all?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled."
Ron Swanson,"No, it's happening."
Ron Swanson,"Look, just do a good job tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,We have to push this thing through.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,I'll push anything through anything.
Leslie Knope,You know me.
Ron Swanson,Are you sweating through your suit?
Leslie Knope,I doubt it.
Leslie Knope,It's a very breathable fabric--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I am.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, what's up, man?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're into pretzels, right?"
Tom Haverford,Bam!
Tom Haverford,"Hit them up, man."
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming down.
Tom Haverford,I got a seat taped off for you over there.
Tom Haverford,"My top priority with this park, getting your fences in there."
Tom Haverford,I drove by one of your fences the other day.
Tom Haverford,"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome."""
Tom Haverford,"I was like, of course, Roy's."
Tom Haverford,"If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want."
Tom Haverford,Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.
Tom Haverford,"Well, guess what?"
Tom Haverford,"Here's the gun, here's me."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,Victor Miles.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Tom Haverford,Thank you so much for coming down.
Tom Haverford,I want to introduce you to Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Victor Miles.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Tom Haverford,He's a gentleman I met canvassing.
Tom Haverford,He also happens to be the top sod guy in Indiana.
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Paul,"Hey, Leslie."
Paul,Hey.
Paul,I really want you to nail this.
Tom Haverford,Don from Don's Cement.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Tom Haverford,I was thinking of a jingle for your company.
Tom Haverford,How's this?
Tom Haverford,Don's cement It's the best you can get Don's
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Andy came, too, to give his support."
Andy Dwyer,"I have a lot of stage experience, soâ¦"
Ann Perkins,"This will be fine, right?"
Andy Dwyer,It's a park for God's sakes.
Andy Dwyer,How much can they hate a park?
Ann Perkins,A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you in the audience."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you."
Leslie Knope,And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
April Ludgate,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious!
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
April Ludgate,Probably.
Leslie Knope,"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably."""
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"Line up, everybody."
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I can't do that.
Leslie Knope,That's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming out tonight.
Leslie Knope,This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,This is gonna be a train wreck.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, ""There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother."""
Leslie Knope,"Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,"None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately."
Leslie Knope,But they totally exist.
Leslie Knope,I did not make them up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I see a question."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No questions right now.
Kate Spivack,My name is Kate Spivack.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I remember you.
Kate Spivack,And I live in the neighborhood.
Kate Spivack,And I am 100% against this park.
Kate Spivack,"I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project."
Leslie Knope,"Uh... So, what would he say?"
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.
Leslie Knope,He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.
Leslie Knope,Certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,He's the man.
Leslie Knope,He's capable of anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's got excellent drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.
Mark Brendanawicz,Any questions?
Lawrence,I have more of a comment than a question.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go for it.
Lawrence,It's for the guy in the casts.
Andy Dwyer,"Here we go, Lawrence."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,That is Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.
Lawrence,"Uh, yeah."
Lawrence,I don't care about any of that.
Lawrence,He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage.
Lawrence,It's driving me nuts.
Andy Dwyer,Lawrence lives with his grandma.
Andy Dwyer,Which is pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"He takes care of her, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"But whatever, he's a douchebag."
Lawrence,"It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds."
Andy Dwyer,"You have birds, now?"
Lawrence,"Yeah, I have birds."
Lawrence,"I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I don't work for the government, okay? Uh, I do play rock and roll."
Andy Dwyer,Guilty as charged.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.
Andy Dwyer,It's called Just the Tip.
Andy Dwyer,"And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?"
Ron Swanson,Uh.
Ron Swanson,It is not going well at all.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Ron Swanson,It's going very poorly.
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Ron Swanson,"Like, you're crashing and burning."
Leslie Knope,Democracy's happening.
Leslie Knope,People are talking.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?"
Ron Swanson,You're right about that.
Ron Swanson,They're deeply negative.
Ron Swanson,"You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote."
Tom Haverford,I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.
Leslie Knope,"Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox."
Leslie Knope,"He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death."
Leslie Knope,Flash forward to 1969.
Leslie Knope,Man walks on the moon.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is lousy with hippies--
Paul,"My, God."
Paul,She's filibustering her own meeting.
Leslie Knope,Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.
Leslie Knope,"I can't speak of the future, but I will."
Leslie Knope,"The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words."
Leslie Knope,"And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster."
Kate Spivack,Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time?
Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but"""
Kate Spivack,"Okay, all right."
Kate Spivack,"You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you did already talk, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,And I would love to listen to someone else.
Leslie Knope,Someone I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.
Leslie Knope,Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,"Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea."
April Ludgate,"And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community."
Lawrence,Hey! I recognize her.
Lawrence,That kid came to my door yesterday.
Kate Spivack,"Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience."
Kate Spivack,Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea.
Kate Spivack,We should just take a vote.
Kate Spivack,Right? Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we will take a vote."
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you."
Leslie Knope,One by one.
Ann Perkins,That was brutal.
Ann Perkins,"A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum."
Ann Perkins,"God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people."
Ann Perkins,"I wasn't, right?"
Extra,"At 5:00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep! I don't want to hear that."
Extra,"Now, how long is this project gonna take? That's what I want to know."
Extra,That's what's important to me.
Extra,Because I need my sleep.
Extra,I put some
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,That concludes our meeting.
Kate Spivack,What about the vote?
Leslie Knope,We're out of time.
Leslie Knope,It's 9 o' clock.
Leslie Knope,"But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,It was tough.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, that's Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,That's democracy.
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of people here that want this park.
Leslie Knope,You just gotta get past the negative people.
Leslie Knope,But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.
Leslie Knope,"God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it."
Lawrence,"Hey, park lady."
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Lawrence,You suck.
Leslie Knope,"Hear that? He called me ""park lady."""
Tom Haverford,"You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome."
