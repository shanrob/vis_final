Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,It's impossible.
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna work in a million years.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,I give up.
Ben Wyatt,"Good attitude, honey."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, what do you want from me?"
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land."""
Leslie Knope,"""It would be so nice."""
Leslie Knope,Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I beat them.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.
Ben Wyatt,They're just a company.
Ben Wyatt,They're not that powerful.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"""Open your door?"""
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're about to die!"
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my, The robots have come for us."
Leslie Knope,I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.
Mike Bean,"Hey, Leslie Knope."
Mike Bean,"Please enjoy this free gift, courtesy of Gryzzl."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone."
Mike Bean,Later!
Leslie Knope,We're screwed.
Andy Dwyer,Mmmâ¦
Tom Haverford,"New dish we're working on, tell me what you think."
Tom Haverford,"It's a red and white heirloom red bean pasta, with an imported Tuscan walnut herb sauce infused with shaved heritage Pecorino Romano."
Tom Haverford,"What, you're done?"
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,Really good.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you doing new dishes?
Tom Haverford,"Lucy is visiting her boyfriend, Conrad, in Chicago."
Tom Haverford,So I'm just trying to distract myself with work so I don't think about the marathon bone sex they're probably having.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know what, dude, you gotta take your mind off them."
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,It's a contract.
Andy Dwyer,"It came from the station manager where I do my show, Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"He wants me to sign it, but it says that they'll own the character Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, this says they only pay you 100 bucks a week?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day, write, produce and direct a TV show."
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I act in it, I do sets, props, wardrobe."
Andy Dwyer,At the end I drive everybody home.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I mean, 100 bucks a week, that's pretty fair."
Tom Haverford,This is perfect.
Tom Haverford,I'll be your agent.
Tom Haverford,I'll put all my energy into renegotiating your contract.
Tom Haverford,I won't even think about Lucy and Conrad and his stupid crunches that he probably does.
Tom Haverford,I should probably do some crunches.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, my tumtum!"
Donna Meagle,"Knope, I need to talk to you."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Donna Meagle,"I know I technically work for Gryzzl, but these fools have crossed a line."
Donna Meagle,Have you gotten one of these Gryzzl boxes?
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet."
Leslie Knope,Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.
Donna Meagle,These are my free gifts.
Donna Meagle,Two honey bears and a canister of sugar plums.
Donna Meagle,Honeybear and Sugar Plum are the special names Joe and I call each other.
Leslie Knope,Aww!
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we're adorable, but this is creepy."
Donna Meagle,Because we only call each other these things on the phone or in texts.
Donna Meagle,How do they even know?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, open that box they sent you."
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor."
Ben Wyatt,A thousand?
Leslie Knope,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!
Leslie Knope,This stuff is perfect for me.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, exactly."
Ben Wyatt,They must be datamining.
Ben Wyatt,Searching our texts and emails and gathering profiles on all of us.
Ben Wyatt,"This is a huge invasion of privacy, not to mention illegal."
Ben Wyatt,"When they installed their free WiFi in town, I made sure that there was language preventing this."
Donna Meagle,I never would have agreed to work with them if I had known they were gonna be snoopin' in my biz.
Donna Meagle,Gryzzl is going down.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna put me on blast, I'm gonna put you on front street."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!
Craig Middlebrooks,"April, the new Parks interns start today, and I was wondering if you would deliver a little welcome speech."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Go away.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Watermelon martinis, exposed brick, Keri Russell's hair."
April Ludgate,Why did you just say those weird things?
Craig Middlebrooks,"On the advice of my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, whenever I feel like yelling, I just take a deep breath and say three great things about being alive."
April Ludgate,Gross.
Craig Middlebrooks,Please talk to my interns.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
April Ludgate,"I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless."
April Ludgate,"Those kids are me 10 years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring."
April Ludgate,"It's too late for me, I've seen too much, but maybe I can save them."
April Ludgate,You're all gonna die in here!
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.
Extra,They sent my husband three boxes of genital cream to his office.
Extra,"My husband's splotchy genitals are no one's business except for his, mine, and his many genital doctors."
Pearl,They sent me a bunch of toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,That's my private hobby.
Pearl,No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,Except now all of you people.
Ben Wyatt,Which one is that?
Pearl,This is actually Hamuel L. Jackson from the movie Pork Fiction.
Pearl,"It's extremely rare, and I am keeping it."
Pearl,"But still, they have no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life."
Extra,I opened my box in front of all my friends and it was a bunch of Virginia Woolf novels.
Extra,Now Miley and Haley know I like to read!
Extra,What if they tell Evan?
Chance Frenlm,"I like their phones, but they've gone too far, sending this stuff to our houses."
Chance Frenlm,Gryzzl has no right to search our private data.
Leslie Knope,"So, wait."
Leslie Knope,You guys are not against us on this?
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this.
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Leslie Knope,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel."
Leslie Knope,The town is behind us.
Leslie Knope,Donna is on our side.
Leslie Knope,And the next domino to fall?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough."
Pearl,"Actually, I'm gonna need that back."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,February 2016.
Leslie Knope,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.
Leslie Knope,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and water park vomit chain reaction."
Ben Wyatt,Why would you take pictures of that?
Leslie Knope,Why would you not?
Ron Swanson,"As you requested, here is a picture of my son, at a recent moment in his life."
Leslie Knope,So cute-- What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,Protecting my son's privacy.
Ron Swanson,"What, I'm just gonna carry around pictures of my child, where anyone could see them?"
Donna Meagle,"Well, it's funny you should mention privacy, because that's our next topic."
Leslie Knope,"Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind."
Ron Swanson,I have no reaction to this.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,"I do not pass judgment on the workings of private businesses, I just build their buildings."
Ron Swanson,"And frankly, if people are foolish enough to carry around a doodad that lets Gryzzl track their every move, this is what they get."
Ben Wyatt,But it's illegal.
Ron Swanson,I don't believe that's true.
Ron Swanson,"I've spent a fair amount of time with Gryzzl's highpriced lawyers, and they do seem to, as they say, ""Keep it 100."""
Donna Meagle,"Well, those fools still think I work for them."
Donna Meagle,"So, I can get you a private VIP tour of the building, maybe you can snoop around."
Roscoe,"Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe."
Roscoe,Psyched to give you guys a tour.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistant turned lover, Gregory Strong."
Leslie Knope,"Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm."
Leslie Knope,But it feels so right.
Ben Wyatt,Steady.
Leslie Knope,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.
Roscoe,Sweet.
Roscoe,Let's get loco.
April Ludgate,"Okay, so, let's get to know each other."
April Ludgate,"Talk about why you're here, whether you're throwing your lives away, stuff like that."
April Ludgate,"You, what brought you here?"
Extra,I love the Parks Department.
Extra,I grew up near Ramsett Park and I used to go to tons of stuff there.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,That doesn't help me.
April Ludgate,Mork?
Extra,"Oh, It's Mike."
Extra,I love parks more than anything.
Extra,And I've been a summer camp counselor since I was 13.
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,Gross.
April Ludgate,What about you?
April Ludgate,Why are you here?
Jen,The only thing I love more than parks is recreation.
April Ludgate,Really?
Jen,No.
Jen,I just needed a college credit.
April Ludgate,What are you studying?
Jen,Nothing.
Jen,College is stupid.
April Ludgate,Then who made you do this?
Jen,My parents.
April Ludgate,What are they like?
Jen,"Well, my mom's the devil and my dad's a dumb doctor."
Extra,My dad's a doctor.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,"Jen, is it?"
Jen,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Let's take a walk, Jen."
April Ludgate,I feel like you have almost zero potential.
April Ludgate,I think that's cool.
Extra,"And, action."
Andy Dwyer,"We meet again, Puppy Hating Dan."
Andy Dwyer,You stole my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,And you put farts in my lunch!
Andy Dwyer,You've really done it this time.
Andy Dwyer,"Puppy Army, attack!"
Extra,Yeah!
Burly,What?
Burly,No!
Burly,I hate puppies!
Burly,I'll admit to everything!
Burly,"You win again, Macklin!"
Andy Dwyer,Another mystery solved!
Andy Dwyer,We'll be right back after this with some more Johnny Karate.
Extra,"Hey, that's lunch everyone."
Extra,We're back in 30 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"Great job, bud."
Tom Haverford,You crushed it.
Tom Haverford,I love being Andy's agent.
Tom Haverford,"He does all the work, and I get 10% just for showing up."
Tom Haverford,"It's like a chef at a restaurant making all the food and then the owner gets the profit, which is my other job."
Tom Haverford,"Man, I really got things figured out."
Hank Muntak,Let's make this quick.
Tom Haverford,Andy's show gets huge ratings in three cities.
Tom Haverford,His GryzzlTube page has millions of views.
Tom Haverford,"If you don't want Andy walking over to your rival station in Snerling, I think you should start taking this seriously."
Hank Muntak,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do."
Hank Muntak,I'm gonna upgrade the parking spot.
Hank Muntak,"But my son gets a role as one of the kid ninjas, all right?"
Hank Muntak,He's gonna love me for it.
Hank Muntak,It's gonna drive my exwife crazy.
Tom Haverford,"So far, so good."
Tom Haverford,"But, in the words of Jerry Maguire"
Andy Dwyer,The human head weighs 8 pounds.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"""Show me the money."""
Hank Muntak,"Andy, do you know how lucky you are to work here?"
Hank Muntak,I'm a kingmaker.
Hank Muntak,"Pip Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez."
Hank Muntak,I made them.
Tom Haverford,You discovered Selena Gomez?
Hank Muntak,Different Selena Gomez.
Hank Muntak,"Look, I don't have the money for a raise."
Tom Haverford,"Uh Yeah, you do."
Tom Haverford,I've seen profit reports.
Tom Haverford,The show is a bonanza.
Tom Haverford,Andy starts making $500 a week.
Tom Haverford,Now.
Hank Muntak,Get the hell out of my office.
Tom Haverford,Sit down.
April Ludgate,"Look, dude, this internship leads nowhere."
April Ludgate,It'll just screw up the rest of your life.
April Ludgate,What do you love doing?
Jen,Texting.
April Ludgate,What did you wanna be when you were little?
Jen,A scary mermaid that lures sailors to their death.
April Ludgate,"Okay, side note, I'm gonna file papers to adopt you as my child, so keep an eye out for that."
April Ludgate,"But more importantly, don't do this internship."
April Ludgate,"Go do something fun, like trying to control birds with your mind, or posting Internet comments as Michael Jackson's ghost."
Jen,Okay.
Jen,Maybe you're right.
Jen,Thanks.
Extra,"Hey, April!"
Extra,We finished those questionnaires you gave us about our hopes and dreams for the internship.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,"Thanks, Mike."
Roscoe,I'm sorry this building is so lame.
Roscoe,"As soon as we get our new headquarters built, it's gonna be way, way tighter."
Roscoe,Check it.
Roscoe,Matty.
Roscoe,"Okay, this is GryzzlVibe."
Roscoe,It's this new app that we're developing that monitors your mood.
Extra,Tell them about it.
Extra,"As you know, the cameras on your phones are always on, whether you're using them or not."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ben Wyatt,They are?
Extra,This app uses facial recognition software to track your expressions.
Extra,It's always watching.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what do you do with this information?"
Roscoe,"Well, if the camera senses that you're in a bad mood, then we could geomatch you to, say, the nearest cup of sweet pick me up java."
Roscoe,"But, if you're in a good mood, then we could geonudge you to, like, a sweet coffee shop."
Roscoe,You could just keep the good times rolling.
Ben Wyatt,So it's really just a coffee sales app.
Roscoe,Yeah.
Roscoe,"Yeah, we're developing with Starbucks."
Extra,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?"
Roscoe,"Oh, hells yeah, dogman!"
Roscoe,"Our super rad algorithm searches all your texts, calls, banking, medical records, blah, blah, blah, to learn what you really want."
Roscoe,"You know, from snacks, to new books and movies, to when you ladies need to score some new 'pons."
Roscoe,"I mean, we might know you better than you know yourself, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,How did you know it was me?
Roscoe,It was about 40 different ways.
Roscoe,"I mean, geomaps on all your different Gryzzl devices."
Roscoe,"And, of course, we facescanned you when you came in."
Roscoe,We're really glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
Roscoe,No.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that your motto?
Leslie Knope,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?"""
Roscoe,Totes.
Roscoe,And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.
Roscoe,"I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone, and track them wherever they go, and anticipate what they're about to do."
Leslie Knope,"These are really interesting issues, Roscoe."
Leslie Knope,"I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV."
Roscoe,TV.
Roscoe,Retro.
Roscoe,I love it.
Roscoe,All right.
Roscoe,I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.
Extra,Skate mode activated.
Roscoe,"Later, chillers."
Extra,"This is The Perdples Court, a legal debate show about issues facing residents of Southern Indiana."
Extra,"With your host, Judge Perd Hapley."
Perd Hapley,"Tonight on The Perdples Court, we will have the guests that have been booked for tonight's show."
Perd Hapley,"The plaintiff, Leslie Knope, who has some big allegations against Gryzzl."
Perd Hapley,"The defendant, Gryzzl Vice President Roscoe Santangelo."
Perd Hapley,Who will win?
Perd Hapley,I don't know yet.
Perd Hapley,Which is what makes this a court show.
Leslie Knope,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining."
Leslie Knope,But there's one more thing we need.
Leslie Knope,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.
Leslie Knope,Public humiliation on live television.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, do not go on television."
Donna Meagle,Swanson?
Donna Meagle,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,This is the 27th version of the Pawnee Gryzzl free wireless Internet thing agreement.
Ron Swanson,Check out the page I marked.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Gryzzl is not allowed to collect and use customer data for any purposes.
Ben Wyatt,It's pretty clear.
Ben Wyatt,See?
Ron Swanson,Look closer.
Ron Swanson,"Amendment C, addendum 14."
Ron Swanson,"It directs you to this appendix, which reroutes you to this one, which says, in a subfootnote"
Ben Wyatt,It says here they can gather and use any information they want.
Ben Wyatt,How did I miss this?
Leslie Knope,Look at the revision date.
Leslie Knope,"December 18th, 2015."
Leslie Knope,That was the opening day of Episode VII.
Leslie Knope,You were muttering that date in your sleep for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew you'd be distracted.
Leslie Knope,That's how they slipped it in.
Ben Wyatt,I did this to the town.
Ben Wyatt,It's my fault.
Ben Wyatt,It's Ice Town all over again.
Ron Swanson,Is Star Wars the one with the little wizard boy?
Hank Muntak,"Okay, this is what I can give you."
Hank Muntak,"No more janitorial duties, better parking spot, unlimited Mike and Ikes from the vending machine, and for salary, we're at 500 a week."
Andy Dwyer,500 whats?
Tom Haverford,"Dollars, man."
Tom Haverford,What about the rights to Johnny Karate?
Hank Muntak,We own the rights to Johnny Karate.
Hank Muntak,I can't bend on that one.
Andy Dwyer,But I invented the character.
Hank Muntak,"Well, invent another character."
Hank Muntak,"Uh Here you go, KungFu Billy."
Hank Muntak,Jeremy Punch Guy.
Hank Muntak,Ed Kick.
Andy Dwyer,Those are actually pretty great.
Andy Dwyer,But Johnny Karate is special to me.
Andy Dwyer,"If we can't get the rights, I'm gonna walk."
Hank Muntak,He's making the biggest mistake of his life.
Hank Muntak,He's walking out on Hank Muntak?
Hank Muntak,I have six Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards.
Hank Muntak,I once sat in the original Batmobile.
Hank Muntak,James Woods follows my niece on Twitter.
Hank Muntak,He's gonna regret this.
Ben Wyatt,"All of this work, everything I've done for this city, it's all a wash now."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's gonna hate me again.
Donna Meagle,"Some of us are already there, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,This is not your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, talk some sense into him."
Ron Swanson,Ben's right.
Ron Swanson,This is Ice Town all over again.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna sign a legally binding document, you need to read it thoroughly."
Ron Swanson,That's why the only contract I've ever signed was my Mulligan's Steakhouse Club Card.
Ron Swanson,"And even then, I used a fake name."
Ron Swanson,Les.
Ron Swanson,Les Vegetables.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna take the fall for this.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, make sure that Donna doesn't hurt him."
April Ludgate,You wanted to see me?
Craig Middlebrooks,Yes.
Craig Middlebrooks,Can you tell me where Jennifer is?
April Ludgate,I convinced her to quit.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Martha Stewart's apron line, my tomato plants-- Oh, God, I'm out."
Craig Middlebrooks,Where's my emergency list?
April Ludgate,"Recently I've been feeling like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life, and it all started with this internship."
April Ludgate,"And I don't want those kids to make the same mistake, okay?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"April, you spent the last 10 years doing amazing things with this Parks Department, and learning from the greatest teacher in this or any business, Leslie Freaking Knope."
Craig Middlebrooks,You'd be a checkout girl at a gas station if it wasn't for that internship!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Sweet potato pie, unlikely animal friend pairings, Jennifer Love Hewitt."
Craig Middlebrooks,"You're lucky to have worked here, no matter what you wanna do with the rest of your life."
Craig Middlebrooks,And I think you know that.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go find a new intern."
Perd Hapley,"Now, Leslie, I understand that what you've brought to the show isn't a box of objects, but rather a symbolic box of allegations."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Perd--"
Perd Hapley,It's Judge Perd.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think there are certain questions about certain aspects of certain parts of this situation that require an evaluation about whether or not this is or is not a valid argument.
Perd Hapley,Extremely well put.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Judge Perd."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager."
Ben Wyatt,"What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill."
Roscoe,Whoa!
Roscoe,"That's a serious allegaysh, homie."
Roscoe,We are hella chill.
Roscoe,"And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we kind of do."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the Internet is no longer optional."
Ben Wyatt,It's a necessity for everyone.
Ben Wyatt,"And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement."
Ben Wyatt,A person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid being taken advantage of by a multibillion dollar company.
Ben Wyatt,You should be upfront about what you're doing and allow people the ability to opt out.
Perd Hapley,"To be honest, Judge Perd is stumped by this case."
Perd Hapley,I've also misplaced my judge hammer.
Perd Hapley,I cannot render a verdict here.
Perd Hapley,"Therefore, I must declare a mistrial, which is a term I've heard people use in the movies."
Perd Hapley,"Tap, tap, tap."
Perd Hapley,Case ended.
Extra,And we're clear.
Roscoe,All right.
Roscoe,"Later, dudes."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, good news."
Andy Dwyer,I think I found a job.
Andy Dwyer,There was an opening for a janitor at the TV station.
Andy Dwyer,"Get this, they're gonna pay me the minimum wage."
Tom Haverford,"Put your mop down, bud."
Tom Haverford,I got you the rights to Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,How?
Tom Haverford,"Just a great agent, I guess."
Tom Haverford,"Please, man, please! Andy's my friend and I want to do a good job, and there's this girl I really like and she lives in Chicago."
Tom Haverford,And she's still dating someone.
Tom Haverford,I just feel like--
Hank Muntak,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Do you wanna eat at my restaurant for free? Every week.
Tom Haverford,You can come once a week.
Tom Haverford,It's free.
Hank Muntak,"Hey, okay."
Hank Muntak,Fine.
Hank Muntak,Just stop.
Andy Dwyer,See? I told you it was gonna work out.
Andy Dwyer,That's actually really good advice for anything.
Andy Dwyer,"If there's something that you want badly, you just have to believe that it's gonna work out."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,I am sorry that I screwed up your life.
April Ludgate,I found a bunch of new potential interns to replace Jen.
Extra,Hi.
Craig Middlebrooks,How'd you manage that?
April Ludgate,"I just thought, ""What would Leslie do?"" So I handed out flyers and I canvassed the college."
April Ludgate,I even baked a bunch of cookies.
April Ludgate,It was weird.
April Ludgate,I actually really enjoyed finding them.
April Ludgate,And I enjoyed bullying Jen into quitting.
Craig Middlebrooks,Hmm.
Craig Middlebrooks,You should add telling people what to do to your perfect job description.
April Ludgate,Good idea.
April Ludgate,"You should up your therapy to seven times a week, stop dressing that way and give me your wallet."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Victor Garber, James Garner, Jennifer Garner."
Craig Middlebrooks,I go alphabetical now.
Tom Haverford,Hey! You're back.
Tom Haverford,How was the trip?
Lucy,It was okay.
Lucy,Kind of weird.
Tom Haverford,"Weird couple of days for me, too."
Tom Haverford,"Closed a bunch of deals, did a bunch of crunchesâ¦"
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,I broke up with Conrad.
Lucy,Which was a long time coming but it's still weird.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Do you want to talk about it?
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy,I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.
Lucy,But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTAs.
Tom Haverford,He deserved it.
Lucy,"No, he didn't!"
Tom Haverford,Uh Settle in.
Tom Haverford,Because I have some very strong feelings about this.
Leslie Knope,They're all down.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,Sometimes I think they're somehow the first humans who don't need sleep.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town."
Leslie Knope,"You have done so much for this town, and people know that."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just sorry we couldn't find something illegal on Gryzzl.
Ben Wyatt,"If we're gonna stop them, and you're gonna beat them on the Newport land, we need more ammo."
Ron Swanson,We need to talk.
Ben Wyatt,What is that?
Ron Swanson,This is a flying robot I just shot out of the sky after it delivered a package to my house.
Leslie Knope,I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on--
Ron Swanson,The package was addressed to my son.
Ron Swanson,Who is four years old and does not own a Gryzzl doodad.
Ron Swanson,Somehow the robots looked at Diane's computer and learned something about my child and then brought him a box of presents.
Ron Swanson,So I destroyed the robot.
Ron Swanson,No one is safe from these bastards.
Ron Swanson,"Tell me what to do, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,I wanna help you take 'em down.
