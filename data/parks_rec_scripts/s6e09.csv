April Ludgate,"Andy got back from London two days ago, and he still has jet lag."
April Ludgate,It's really annoying.
April Ludgate,We're on totally different schedules.
April Ludgate,Last night he mowed the lawn at 2:00 in the morning.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Get me a beer?
April Ludgate,All right.
April Ludgate,"As soon as I wake up he goes down, hard."
April Ludgate,This has to stop.
April Ludgate,"Babe, wake up."
Andy Dwyer,"That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca."
April Ludgate,Babe!
April Ludgate,"You hungry, Champion?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you kidding me?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I fell asleep again?"
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have got to stay up and get on a regular schedule!"
Andy Dwyer,Were you about to spray me with the hose inside the house?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I kind of want you to do it now.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,No no no no no no.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just a reminder, guys, today is Leslie's last day as a city councilor, so everyone be extra supportive."
Ron Swanson,Already done.
Ron Swanson,"When she walked past me this morning, I gave her a kind nod."
Ben Wyatt,Heartwarming.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I want to get her a present to cheer her up on her last day."
Ben Wyatt,Any ideas?
Donna Meagle,"A ""Sorry You Lost Your Dream Job"" gift?"
Donna Meagle,"Um, that's a tough one."
Donna Meagle,Stay away from wine.
Donna Meagle,Wine is crying juice.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I mean, you know her better than anybody."
Jerry Gergich,What does she really want more than anything in the world?
Ben Wyatt,A nice candle!
Ben Wyatt,I'm screwed.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, no!"
April Ludgate,No!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I'll be right out.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is the Pawnee City Council Chambers."
Leslie Knope,Your new home away from home.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, technically, my home away from home is in Zurich."
Ingrid de Forest,But this is nice too.
Leslie Knope,Today is my last day as City-- Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Let me try this again.
Leslie Knope,"Today is my last day asâ¦ Today is my last-- Today is my last day... You know what, you get the idea."
Leslie Knope,"My old friend Ingrid De Forest won the recall vote, and she's taking my place on Monday morning."
Leslie Knope,"But you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings, and I've gone through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance, cat returning to the adoption place, watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown and not giving a flying fart."
Leslie Knope,How many stages is that?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,The point is I'm fine now.
Ingrid de Forest,This must be hard for you.
Ingrid de Forest,"It's like what Sir Ian McKellen said to me the day I sold my boat to Karl Lagerfeld, ""Parting is such sweet sorrow."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is your life?
Ingrid de Forest,"If it makes any difference, your work here was a real inspiration to me, and I am going to do my best to continue your legacy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate the sentiment."
Ingrid de Forest,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud?
Ingrid de Forest,No.
Ingrid de Forest,"But, would you like to?"
Ingrid de Forest,I studied opera at the Sorbonne.
Ingrid de Forest,I'd be happy to harmonize.
Ingrid de Forest,Goodbye Goodbye Nah.
Leslie Knope,No.
Trevor Nelson,"And finally, here is a check for the entirety of the purchase of Rent A Swag."
Trevor Nelson,"And here is a personal note from my client, Dr. Saperstein."
Tom Haverford,"""Dear Tom, I win."""
Tom Haverford,"""You suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"""You still suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself?"
Tom Haverford,He had to send in his lackey.
Trevor Nelson,My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be.
Trevor Nelson,"Successful people, Mr. Haverford, use their money to get others to work for them."
Tom Haverford,"Mmm, that's an interesting idea, lawyer dude."
Tom Haverford,What if I give you five bucks to put a bag of poop in Saperstein's car?
Trevor Nelson,No.
Tom Haverford,"Ballpark me, how much would it cost?"
Trevor Nelson,10000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,"Counteroffer, why don't you just do it for the story?"
Trevor Nelson,"Goodbye, Mr. Haverford."
Dr. Saperstein,Is it done?
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, how many times did he turn the paper over?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, that is disappointing."
Dr. Saperstein,"So, look at this baby."
Dr. Saperstein,That is the most symmetrical fetus I've ever seen.
Dr. Saperstein,This could be a superhero.
Chris Traeger,Dr. Saperstein.
Dr. Saperstein,Yes.
Chris Traeger,"I know that we should hate you because you destroyed our friend's business, but we love you so much."
Ann Perkins,We love you.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm lovable.
Dr. Saperstein,"So, do you want to know the sex?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God Should we?"
Ann Perkins,"No, right?"
Ann Perkins,Or maybe yes?
Chris Traeger,Is there an option other than yes or no?
Dr. Saperstein,I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm gonna write it down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Then I'm going to put it in an envelope, seal it, and when you're ready, voila."
Ann Perkins,That'll be fun.
Chris Traeger,It's like the Oscars.
Ann Perkins,Let's get some food.
Ann Perkins,I'm starving.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to pee."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to barf!"
Ann Perkins,"Actually, all three."
Ann Perkins,Being pregnant is great.
Tom Haverford,"And finally, Larry's share of the profit."
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Good to be Larry.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's not, you boring grandpa."
Tom Haverford,"Meanwhile, Tommy's riding high, 32,000 dollars."
Tom Haverford,I'm basically a millionaire.
April Ludgate,"What are you going to do with the money, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,Glad you asked.
Tom Haverford,A horrible man recently gave me some great advice.
Tom Haverford,"For years, I've been coming up with my own ideas like some sort of non-rich idiot."
Tom Haverford,Now I'm going to let people come to me and invest my scrilla in the best idea I hear.
Ron Swanson,That sounds like an efficient use of the free market.
Ron Swanson,"I would wish you the best of luck, but I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures."
Tom Haverford,"Come hear the ideas with me, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice."
Donna Meagle,Do you think everyone here is a grandfather?
Tom Haverford,"Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa."
Tom Haverford,"And if you are a grandpa, you're dead."
April Ludgate,That sounds right.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, oops!"
Jerry Gergich,"This check is made out to ""Lenny,"" which I think is a typo for ""Larry,"" which isn't even actually my name."
April Ludgate,"Well, tell it to the bank, Lenny."
Jerry Gergich,Am I Am I Lenny now?
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to order a singing telegram.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my wife lost her job, so maybe something sad and slow?"
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anything from the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack?
Ben Wyatt,This is a bad idea.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm hanging up now, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ingrid is settled into my office, and this box contains the last of my stuff."
Leslie Knope,Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should go back for those?
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,There'll be other salt packets.
Leslie Knope,But not the kind that snaps in half maybe.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know I'm a broken record, but getting away from the City Council is absolutely the best thing for you."
Ben Wyatt,Trust me.
Perd Hapley,"This is Perd Hapley, talking to you now about what's going on, today."
Perd Hapley,"We're live at City Hall, where City Councilman Dexhart is addressing his latest sex scandal."
Councilman Dexhart,"Recently, certain allegations have come to light about my inappropriate conduct."
Councilman Dexhart,I am here to set the record straight.
Councilman Dexhart,I totally did all of it.
Ben Wyatt,Another sex scandal?
Ben Wyatt,This guy is unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How does he find the time?
Councilman Dexhart,"I also engaged in inappropriate texting, ""sexting,"" and ""Tex-Mexting,"" which is where you send photos of your junk from the restroom of a Chili's To Go."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Councilman Dexhart,"Does this make me a ""bad boy""?"
Councilman Dexhart,You tell me.
Councilman Dexhart,"No, really, tell me."
Councilman Dexhart,It gets me off when women tell me that.
Leslie Knope,He's reading this.
Leslie Knope,He wrote this down.
Councilman Dexhart,"I sent these texts to roughly 100 women, under the following pseudonyms"" ""Enrique Shockwave,"" ""Willie Dynamite,"" ""Lee Harvey Teabag."""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least you won't have to deal with that guy anymore."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Not after someone beats him in the next election.
Leslie Knope,Someone who is smart and hardworking and who knows the job because she's done it already and is also blonde and named Leslie and loves you!
Ben Wyatt,Is it you?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to run again.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to beat Dexhart!
Councilman Dexhart,"and ""Anthony Weiner."""
Ben Wyatt,Another City Council campaign?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, think about what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, for one, we don't even live in Dexhart's district."
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, but we can go and rent a second apartment, and we can spend 51% of our time there, and then I'll file the campaign form from that address."
Ben Wyatt,"I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district, it's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,It's like a raccoon shanty town.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not that bad."
Ben Wyatt,"And also, Dexhart fights dirty."
Ben Wyatt,"He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched earth campaigns."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"I've got plenty of dirt on that scumbag, I say bring it on."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm going to start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and"
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath, think about if this is really worth it."
Leslie Knope,Anything is worth me getting back on City Council.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's see which one of these lucky visionaries is gonna make me rich."
Tom Haverford,Greg Phillips?
Extra,"Hi, guys."
Extra,Thanks for meeting with me.
April Ludgate,Enough chitchat.
April Ludgate,"What's your pitch, kid?"
April Ludgate,"Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge, let's go."
Extra,"Okay, so, my idea is for an abacus, but on your phone."
Extra,"I call it a ""phone-bacus."""
Ron Swanson,"Son, you just described a calculator."
Extra,"But you're talking about it, right?"
Extra,"Three words, Automated Word Counter."
Tom Haverford,Get out.
Extra,Two words.
Tom Haverford,No.
Extra,One word.
Jerry Gergich,"As you may know, I do like to tinker with things in my garage."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna hit the can while he's up.
Jerry Gergich,"So, I think I have discovered a way to generate clean, renewable energy."
Jerry Gergich,I think it's going to
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Gross!
April Ludgate,"God, Larry, you sneezed all over us!"
Tom Haverford,I'm not going to buy that thing.
Tom Haverford,It's covered in a gallon of your boogers!
Jerry Gergich,I totally understand.
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, Geez!"
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we have a girl.
Ann Perkins,"Aw, tiny dresses, braids, glitter on everything?"
Ann Perkins,Forget it.
Chris Traeger,And also girls' names are so cute.
Chris Traeger,"Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly"
Ann Perkins,"Olive, Rosemary, Chicken."
Ann Perkins,Fifty burritos.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, I'm starving."
Ann Perkins,"Miss, hi, I'm pregnant, and I'm a little bit crazy, so if you don't bring our appetizers out in the next 30 seconds, I'm going to plunge your face into the deep fryer."
Chris Traeger,"And also two waters, please, but no hurry."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, I don't know if there's a story in these emails."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"They're iffy, but Dexhart has been elected eight times."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't think the voters care.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,His poll numbers are actually up since the scandal broke.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's just because people found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He is?
Councilman Dexhart,"Morning, Leslie."
Councilman Dexhart,Sweet Jugs.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He's kinda cute.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Shauna, no."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I just feel like I could fix him, you know?"
Tom Haverford,This sucks!
Tom Haverford,We heard 100 pitches and they're all terrible.
Tom Haverford,Change of plans.
Tom Haverford,You guys are my idea factory.
Tom Haverford,"April, go!"
April Ludgate,"Okay, I got one."
April Ludgate,"""Macaroni and Poison,"" it's like mac and cheese, but with a special ingredient."
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Ron Swanson,Every socket set I've ever bought only goes up to half inch.
Ron Swanson,"I'd love a couple larger sizes, take it all the way up to five eighths."
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,Bears bouncing on trampoline roads.
Andy Dwyer,There's a chance that I might have dreamed that.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, time to head back to the office."
Ron Swanson,"I've missed an entire day of work, so at least some good came from this."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference, so I am cobbling together a banner from all the other discarded banners."
Ben Wyatt,"""Second chunce four Lesle"""
Ben Wyatt,Perv Dexxxhrt equals birthday mouse?
Leslie Knope,Rat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, listen to yourself, loopholes, scorched earth policies. This isn't you."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this.
Leslie Knope,Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office?
Leslie Knope,"That is not a coincidence, this was meant to be."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't we gather everyone in here, you explain to them what you're thinking, and we get some feedback."
Leslie Knope,Now you're talking!
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we had a boy.
Chris Traeger,"I have perfected the art of shaving the human face, and I would love to be able to pass that on."
Ann Perkins,"Toy trucks, superhero costumes, tiny little acorn penis? Forget it."
Chris Traeger,"A weird image, but one that does not diminish my enthusiasm."
Chris Traeger,"Well, Ann Perkins, are you ready to find out the sex of our baby?"
Ann Perkins,I'm ready.
Chris Traeger,"We are having a ""Distributions."""
Chris Traeger,"That's what it looks like, ""Distributions."""
Ann Perkins,Let me see that.
Ann Perkins,"It says ""Congratulations."""
Ann Perkins,I think.
Ann Perkins,"Then it says, ""I leg Smurf."""
Ann Perkins,Are we having a Smurf?
Chris Traeger,"We are having an ""eleven jewel toilet."""
Ann Perkins,I can't tell what's words and what's punctuation.
Ann Perkins,The suspense is killing me!
Chris Traeger,I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.
Ann Perkins,I'm calling Domino's.
Ann Perkins,Do you think Domino's delivers to this restaurant?
Ann Perkins,I hope so.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,He's out for the rest of the day.
Chris Traeger,I have literally never been more stressed out.
Leslie Knope,"Good, you guys are here."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,I have a big announcement.
Leslie Knope,I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to be running for Dexhart's seat, and the campaign starts now!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer."
Leslie Knope,"That's what's happening, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, no offense, I've heard a lot of bad ideas today, this is the worst."
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,I would love it if you ran an insane campaign and basically turned into the Joker.
April Ludgate,But that means you probably shouldn't do it.
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"It seems risky, and I'd hate to see you go through another tough fight."
Andy Dwyer,"But I could be wrong, I haven't pooped in three days."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you have always given me sage counsel, and your words carry great influence."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you think I should do?"
Ron Swanson,I do not think you should run again.
Leslie Knope,"What the hell do you know, dumdum?"
Leslie Knope,"All of you, look, this is my only option."
Leslie Knope,I am running again with or without you.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you're running for office again?"
Jerry Gergich,What a great idea!
Jerry Gergich,How can I help?
Tom Haverford,"Well, no one else brought me any good business ideas, so I decided to take care of it myself."
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue!
Tom Haverford,"Every time you pull one out, you get a little message to hype you up."
Tom Haverford,"Blow that nose, playa!"
April Ludgate,No.
Tom Haverford,This stinks!
Tom Haverford,I'm just gonna have to go back to my same job that I've had forever.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I get why you're bummed out."
April Ludgate,"I mean, look at me, I'm younger than you, and I already have my own department."
April Ludgate,"Plus I'm married, and I make more money than you."
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,You just merged your department with Parks and then made up your own title.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,It's awesome.
Tom Haverford,"I'm empty, yo!"
Tom Haverford,Fill me up!
Andy Dwyer,Do that again.
Dr. Saperstein,What could you possibly need at 6:00 in the morning?
Ann Perkins,"We couldn't read your writing, and we need to know the sex of our baby."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm watching cartoons with my son.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy, an Elmer Fudd one is on."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Stop it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What's up, beautiful?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I live in the guesthouse.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I get together in a special way?
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The more the merrier.
Chris Traeger,With my baby.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You can come too, beautiful."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Look at that, I guess sometimes I call men ""beautiful"" too."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I guess I'm open-minded as hell!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I think you're pretty goodlooking
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Can you just read that and tell us what the sex is, please?"
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,It looks like the chicken that wrote this had a stroke on the paper.
Dr. Saperstein,"Listen, I kind of remember, but I don't want to say anything that's wrong."
Dr. Saperstein,Give me 15 minutes.
Dr. Saperstein,"I will get dressed, we'll go down to my office."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Have a good day at work today, Daddy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Also, if you don't know already, there's a malfunction with the TV where it keeps ordering porno"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Like a ton of porno, like how can someone watch that much porno in one sitting, only when you're out of the house, so if you see it on the bill that's why."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"""And therefore, with your help, we can make our future bright."
Leslie Knope,"""I believe I still have a lot to offer this city."""
Ben Wyatt,I'd swap those two lines.
Ben Wyatt,Always helps to end on the call to action.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry if it felt like everyone piled on.
Ben Wyatt,"We were just being honest, but if you really want to do this, of course we'll support you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I stormed out.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've been thinking for weeks of what to get you as a ""last day in City Council"" present."
Ben Wyatt,I finally figured it out.
Ben Wyatt,"You remember Jen Barkley, political consultant and power broker."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope,What brings you back to Pawnee?
Jennifer Barkley,Ben bought one hour of my time.
Jennifer Barkley,I heard you need some consulting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, I guess."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, how are you? How's your family?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, I get paid $1,200 an hour."
Jennifer Barkley,Do you really want to spend any of that time talking about my mother and her 19-year-old Korean husband?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that does sound fascinating,"
Leslie Knope,but you're right.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, getting a chair."
Tom Haverford,Ron! That's how I enter rooms now.
Tom Haverford,It's more dramatic.
Ron Swanson,Why did you enter at all?
Tom Haverford,Because I have some huge news.
Tom Haverford,You're looking at Pawnee's new Business Liaison.
Ron Swanson,I don't like French words.
Ron Swanson,"I do like the word ""business."""
Ron Swanson,You may continue.
Tom Haverford,"April created a new position for herself, and I want to do the same."
Tom Haverford,"The town could use more private sector money after the merger, so as Business Liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee."
Ron Swanson,Now this is a good idea.
Ron Swanson,"You've come a long way, son."
Tom Haverford,And while I've got you here
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue.
Tom Haverford,Go for it.
Tom Haverford,"Yo, dawg, life is what you make of it! Leave while I'm ahead? You got it! Clear them sinuses, playboy."
Tom Haverford,"Someone's got the ""sniffies."""
Tom Haverford,Tell your mama you love her.
Tom Haverford,"Step up your vitamin C game, bro."
Leslie Knope,So they recall me after all I've done for them!
Jennifer Barkley,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,But Dexhart now has another sex scandal.
Jennifer Barkley,Of course he does.
Leslie Knope,"And the plan is I'm going to run for his seat because how do I lose to a guy like that? That's a great idea, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,It's a terrible idea.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Jennifer Barkley,"First of all, you could lose to a guy like that."
Jennifer Barkley,"I should know, those terrible people have paid me so much money, I have a condo on every Virgin Island."
Jennifer Barkley,"Now, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley,"You're smart, Ben is smart, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley,But why would you want to?
Leslie Knope,Because it's my dream job.
Jennifer Barkley,Then dream bigger.
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, you love this town, it's being run by monsters and morons? Get a better job, rise above their heads, affect change at a higher level."
Jennifer Barkley,"Don't be the kid that graduates high school, hangs out in the school parking lot."
Jennifer Barkley,"Be the woman who moves away climbs the ladder, and then confidently comes and has sex with her hot old English teacher just for kicks."
Leslie Knope,Is that what you did?
Jennifer Barkley,"Yeah, Mr. Baker."
Jennifer Barkley,"Sex was pretty good, thanks to me."
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, Pawnee has done you a favor."
Jennifer Barkley,You've outgrown them.
Jennifer Barkley,"You've got talent, you've got name recognition, which means that you have a bright, wide-open future with a thousand options."
Jennifer Barkley,"State Senate, federal jobs, even Congress, all of these are doable for you."
Jennifer Barkley,And you can trust me.
Jennifer Barkley,Because I don't care enough about you to lie.
Jennifer Barkley,"Uh-oh, time's up Okay, if you want to keep talking, you're going to have to pay me 1,200 more dollars."
Leslie Knope,I just need
Jennifer Barkley,"I swear to God, if you say one more word, you will legally owe me 1200 dollars, and I will sue you."
Jennifer Barkley,Let's not end it like that.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, great to see you, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,Those five words are on me.
Jennifer Barkley,Should I move this back? Don't answer that.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know what you're thinking, but you have a press conference in 10 minutes."
Chris Traeger,"Well, this is it. The final moment."
Chris Traeger,What are you hoping for?
Ann Perkins,I will honestly be happy either way.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,"Boy or girl, it doesn't matter."
Chris Traeger,Because it will literally be the greatest child who has ever lived.
Ann Perkins,You swear you have no preference?
Chris Traeger,You?
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Dr. Saperstein,"Who's ready, raise your hand? It's a boy!"
Chris Traeger,Yes! Yes! I thought you didn't have a preference!
Ann Perkins,I didn't.
Ann Perkins,I just really wanted it to be a boy.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,I don't know why.
Dr. Saperstein,You guys are just so neat.
Dr. Saperstein,"Would you be interested in adopting my children? They're in their late 20s, They're terrible."
Dr. Saperstein,No? No go? Huh.
Dr. Saperstein,I ask all my patients.
Leslie Knope,"I have gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement about my future."
Leslie Knope,"I will be heading to lunch today, with my husband, at JJ's Diner."
Leslie Knope,We will eat waffles and then we will go home and make out on our couch.
Leslie Knope,"That is my future, for now."
Leslie Knope,"It's been an honor to serve this town, and I will cherish the memories forever."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Perd Hapley,"There you have it, a shockingly un-shocking press conference, in which a recently-unemployed woman said nothing of importance."
Perd Hapley,I'm Perd Hapley and I just realized I'm not holding my microphone.
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was the best present I could've gotten.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt,But I did get you one other present to take your mind off of all this.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you are the sweetest man in the world."
Leslie Knope,Where is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not here."
Ben Wyatt,We have to go get it.
Leslie Knope,"In times of stress, or moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you."
Leslie Knope,"When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen to the people who love you when they give you advice, and remember what really matters."
Leslie Knope,"And if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, go to Paris."
Ben Wyatt,I found one.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
