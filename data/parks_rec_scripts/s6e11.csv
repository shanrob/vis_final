Ben Wyatt,"I've got to say that this report is quite impressive, Miss Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Mr. City Manager."
Leslie Knope,And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ron Swanson,"Can we hurry this up, please?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fantastic work of one of your employees, especially if she's adorable."
Leslie Knope,"I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher."
Leslie Knope,And awesome.
Leslie Knope,We live together
Ben Wyatt,And work together.
Leslie Knope,And we are so In sync
Ben Wyatt,That we finish each other's
Leslie Knope,Sentences!
Leslie Knope,We rehearsed that at home.
Leslie Knope,Naked in bed.
Ben Wyatt,What!
Leslie Knope,What!
Ron Swanson,Please stamp the form.
Ben Wyatt,I just want to admire it one more time.
Ben Wyatt,"Again, fantastic work."
Ben Wyatt,"In fact, such good work I think I'm in love with you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,Stamp the form.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out."
Leslie Knope,"We love you too, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Stamp the damn form.
Leslie Knope,Group hug!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm down for a group hug."
Ben Wyatt,Little G.H.
Ben Wyatt,Bring it in.
Ben Wyatt,Come on
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I think our love made him angry.
Ben Wyatt,I think he broke my wrist.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"Good morning, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling today?
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.
Chris Traeger,Whales don't have feet.
Ann Perkins,I am a crazy shape.
Ann Perkins,"This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin."
Ann Perkins,Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Let me rub them.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait."
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I read something on raddadsolutions.net that there's a pressure point in the foot that could induce labor.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
Ann Perkins,I don't care.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, I'll cut them in half for you."
Chris Traeger,And I will pour you a glass of flaxseed milk to wash it down.
Chris Traeger,Everything is amazing.
Chris Traeger,"Today is perfect, and I love you."
Ann Perkins,Chris is so wonderful and thoughtful and positive.
Ann Perkins,He's driving me up the wall.
Chris Traeger,Smoothie's ready!
Leslie Knope,Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.
Leslie Knope,"It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs."
Extra,Look at this tiny tree.
Extra,Can you eat this?
Extra,Aww.
Extra,This one's dead.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Connie Cabbage."
Leslie Knope,What's good today?
Connie Cabbage,Green cabbage is always a safe bet.
Connie Cabbage,Red cabbage is good.
Connie Cabbage,"I mean, you can't go wrong."
Connie Cabbage,That's the fun thing about cabbage.
Ben Wyatt,One of the fun things.
Connie Cabbage,Oh!
Nolan,"Time to crank this market up a notch, y'all!"
Ben Wyatt,"""Chardbodies: Get a chard on""?"
Nolan,"Let's get ""recharded"" in here!"
Leslie Knope,What the hell is going on?
Connie Cabbage,"Oh, yeah."
Connie Cabbage,That's the new chard stand.
Connie Cabbage,I suppose that's one way to sell vegetables.
Nolan,"We got Swiss chard, we got white chard, we got chard poppers!"
Nolan,And for all you freaky vegans out there... We got chard shots!
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,"Mmm, chard is so bitter."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, do something."
Ben Wyatt,What do you want me to do?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're the city manager."
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.
Ben Wyatt,"By ""rules of conduct,"" do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, ""Peas be kind to others""?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are."""
Leslie Knope,"I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but"
Leslie Knope,A little iffy?
Ben Wyatt,I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.
Connie Cabbage,Cabbage!
Connie Cabbage,Come and get it.
Leslie Knope,"Connie, no."
Leslie Knope,Put those away.
Andy Dwyer,"April's sitting on my lap, I shouldn't tell her that I gotta take a crap, oh, no"
April Ludgate,Don't.
Andy Dwyer,I should just go
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, my God."
Craig Middlebrooks,You play guitar?
April Ludgate,"No, that's a super small piano."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, I'm gonna need the sarcasm to take a long walk right now."
Craig Middlebrooks,"My terrible nephew Sebastian is having his sixth birthday party this weekend, and the clown they hired has shingles."
Craig Middlebrooks,You think your band could play for an hour?
April Ludgate,How much?
Craig Middlebrooks,75
Andy Dwyer,"75,000 dollars?"
April Ludgate,How about 300?
Andy Dwyer,"300,000 dollars?"
Craig Middlebrooks,150
April Ludgate,They'll do it.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ah, thank you."
Craig Middlebrooks,That is such a relief.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I love my nephew very much, but he's a horrible little tyrant, so don't ruin this day for him!"
Andy Dwyer,150 bucks?
Andy Dwyer,"Split that four ways, boom."
Andy Dwyer,600 dollars.
Tom Haverford,I'll say it again: The men's room needs a separate dispenser for face wash.
Tom Haverford,I can't wash my face with hand soap.
Tom Haverford,Look at these pores.
Tom Haverford,They're gaping.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,Timeout.
Tom Haverford,Let's take a brief recess.
Tom Haverford,"Can we help you, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work."
Tom Haverford,"It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous."
Tom Haverford,It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.
Donna Meagle,"Over fine wines and cheeses, of course."
Ron Swanson,"Larry, salami!"
Ron Swanson,The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.
Ron Swanson,The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.
Jerry Gergich,And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.
Jerry Gergich,"Now, that is the fourth time this month."
Music,"Hello, walls Hello Hello how'd things go for you today?"
Jerry Gergich,I just want to choke him until he passes out.
Tom Haverford,Time.
Ann Perkins,This looks like fun.
Ann Perkins,I want to try.
Tom Haverford,"Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford,It's Donna's turn next.
Donna Meagle,I'll cede my time to Ann.
Donna Meagle,I have a feeling this is gonna be good.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder."
Donna Meagle,That sucks.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,And I'm never not hungry.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, have some cheese."
Ann Perkins,"I can't have cheese, Larry!"
Ann Perkins,And I can't have wine either.
Ann Perkins,I can't have anything good.
Ann Perkins,"You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed."
Ann Perkins,But I don't want that.
Ann Perkins,You know what I want?
Ann Perkins,Pork rinds.
Ann Perkins,I want jelly beans.
Ann Perkins,And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.
Ann Perkins,"I want to be PacMan, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns."
Ann Perkins,"I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?"
Tom Haverford,Time.
Donna Meagle,Yikes.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Harrison Ford movie night."
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor."
Ben Wyatt,I can't just kick them out for no reason.
Leslie Knope,The reason is it's vegetable porn.
Leslie Knope,Porn on the cob.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just very good at that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children."
Leslie Knope,There's your reason.
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate."
Ben Wyatt,"Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,That's smart.
Leslie Knope,"Home is home, and work is work."
Leslie Knope,We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,Glad you agree.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Crystal Skull it is.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator."
Leslie Knope,"Mmhmm, yeah, uh-huh."
Ben Wyatt,"But still, it's like"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,"Firewall, man."
Leslie Knope,"We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose."
Leslie Knope,"So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158."
Leslie Knope,The new farmers market rule book.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, when did you make this?"
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night.
Leslie Knope,I also made these: Leslie's toffee surprise.
Leslie Knope,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.
Leslie Knope,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.
Leslie Knope,"Good day, colleague."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling?
Ann Perkins,You don't want to know.
Chris Traeger,It's all I want to know.
Ann Perkins,"All right, man, you asked for it."
Ann Perkins,I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.
Ann Perkins,My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an old-fashioned globe.
Ann Perkins,My boobs are getting really sore.
Ann Perkins,"Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on postpartum depression."
Ann Perkins,Now I have pre-postpartum depression anxiety.
Chris Traeger,"Well, never fear."
Chris Traeger,I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.
Chris Traeger,And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.
Chris Traeger,"There, it's all good."
Chris Traeger,Is that better?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,I've been reading up on nipples.
Chris Traeger,"The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit."
Chris Traeger,It's from Kernsten's: the nipple people.
Chris Traeger,"It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word ""nipple."""
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Anyway.
Chris Traeger,Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.
Ann Perkins,"Larry, get in there!"
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Jerry Gergich,What do
Jerry Gergich,I don't even know what we're doing.
Ron Swanson,"What is the meaning of this, nurse?"
Ann Perkins,Emergency whine & cheese club.
Ann Perkins,"Put your headphones on, Ron."
Ann Perkins,I have a lot of complaints.
Ann Perkins,Sit down.
Ann Perkins,I need to vent.
Ann Perkins,And do not under any circumstances respond to anything I say.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"Let's talk about vomit, kids."
Ann Perkins,I do it all day long.
Andy Dwyer,Super fun it feels super good I wanna do it all the time sex is cool
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, Sex Is Cool."
Andy Dwyer,Got that.
Andy Dwyer,I say we finish on Drunk Off Our Asses.
Andy Dwyer,And I think we should do Sex in Space.
Andy Dwyer,"It's 20 minutes long, but it's really good."
April Ludgate,"Babe, I don't think you should play any of those songs for a group of six year olds."
Burly,"Whoa, wait six year olds?"
Burly,Did you book us a gig at a kids' party?
Burly,You said we were playing at a festival.
Chang,You said Dave Grohl might be there.
Andy Dwyer,Dave Grohl might be there.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,He might be anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,"The guy's awesome, and he's unpredictable."
Burly,"No, no, I'm not playing for a bunch of screaming kids."
Burly,Mouse Rat is a rock band.
Burly,We're not the Wiggles.
Andy Dwyer,Come on!
Rivers,I'm sick of all the drama with this band.
Rivers,I quit.
Rivers,I'm going back to rabbinical school.
Andy Dwyer,Umbilical school?
Andy Dwyer,"Rivers, come back."
Andy Dwyer,"Rivers, don't do this."
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Shaq might be there!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I read it, but it seems like your farmers market rules may be specifically targeting chardbodies."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Ben Wyatt,"""No visible cleavage."""
Ben Wyatt,"""No strobe lights."""
Ben Wyatt,"""No chard-related innuendo."""
Leslie Knope,Those apply to all vendors.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's too late."
Leslie Knope,The train has left the station.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what train, from which station?"
Nolan,You're revoking my license?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, back me up on this without hesitation."
Ben Wyatt,"Nolan, can I have a second to speak with my-- with Ms. Knope for a second?"
Nolan,"Look, chard is disgusting."
Nolan,You try selling it without sexy dancers.
Nolan,It's impossible.
Nolan,"It's like, ""Hey, you like lettuce?"""
Nolan,"""Try this."""
Nolan,It's worse.
Nolan,It tastes like kale took a dump on spinach.
Leslie Knope,I like to think of it as celery with B.O.
Leslie Knope,"But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else."
Nolan,I inherited this farm from my dad.
Nolan,It's all I have.
Nolan,"Plus, the other vendors want me there."
Nolan,I'm good for business.
Ben Wyatt,We're not revoking your license.
Ben Wyatt,For now.
Ben Wyatt,I am sorry you had to come in.
Leslie Knope,Judas!
Ben Wyatt,"I don't appreciate being ambushed, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're trying to do.
Leslie Knope,"If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M."
Leslie Knope,And we will solve this chard issue once and for all.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your approval pen.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,There's no such thing.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is."
Leslie Knope,I made it for you last night.
Ann Perkins,"Ugh, and Lamaze class, wait till I tell you about that Ponzi scheme."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?"
Ann Perkins,You know I can't be around smoke or fatty tuna.
Ann Perkins,Ron--
Donna Meagle,"At first, this was funny, but it's gotten out of hand."
Donna Meagle,"This was our chance to vent about work, and you've taken it over."
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,It's sushi and cigar club now.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I see how it is.
Tom Haverford,I feel bad.
Donna Meagle,I don't.
Donna Meagle,This is a Cuban.
Donna Meagle,This is yellowtail.
Donna Meagle,I feel amazing.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Monster in the window!
Ann Perkins,You know what my biggest complaint is?
Ann Perkins,"I have a million things I need to complain about, and I can't take them home because Chris is the most considerate person in the world, and he just wants to help me, and then I feel bad about that, and then I get annoyed that he wants to help me, and I feel even worse about that!"
Ann Perkins,"I thought you guys would be cool with me complaining 'cause it's all you do, is sit here and complain without judgment or guilt."
Ann Perkins,But you know what?
Ann Perkins,I guess I was wrong.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,"I would yell some more, but I think I just peed my pants a little bit."
Ron Swanson,What's happening now?
Ron Swanson,Is the nurse upset?
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, 6:00."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,Larry?
Jerry Gergich,Mm.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Ben couldn't make it, so he asked me to read you this."
Jerry Gergich,"""Dear honey"" Oh, how sweet."
Leslie Knope,Read.
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"""Sorry, but I think we just need to take a break from this work issue."""
Jerry Gergich,"""Please don't grind your teeth too hard when you hear this."""
Jerry Gergich,"""I will see you in the car."""
Jerry Gergich,"""I love you."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that is so sweet that you still write love letters to"
Leslie Knope,What the hell are you doing out here?
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, babe."
Ben Wyatt,I am off city hall property.
Ben Wyatt,You have to stop.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall.
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,"All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall."
Leslie Knope,Firewall down.
Leslie Knope,"Stay frosty, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,We're just getting started.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,You know why?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Because
Leslie Knope,Mother
Ben Wyatt,Haha!
Ben Wyatt,Bank!
Ben Wyatt,Private property.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall restored!
Leslie Knope,Hahaha!
Leslie Knope,The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a municipal construction crew.
Ben Wyatt,"Private fountain, private property."
Ben Wyatt,I'm safe.
Leslie Knope,Guess where the water comes from.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee reservoir.
Leslie Knope,"You can't escape city hall, fool!"
Leslie Knope,Let's dance.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, friends."
Chris Traeger,I'm just about to go on my night jog.
Chris Traeger,Would you like to join me?
Donna Meagle,"Mm, hard pass."
Donna Meagle,We're here because you need to tend to your woman.
Donna Meagle,"She's complaining about everything, ruining whine & cheese club."
Chris Traeger,I literally have 1000 questions.
Chris Traeger,Why is Ron wearing headphones?
Chris Traeger,What's whine & cheese club?
Chris Traeger,And what is Ann complaining about?
Donna Meagle,"You, mostly how you never let her vent because you're always too busy trying to solve everything for her."
Chris Traeger,She's upset that I'm trying to help her?
Ron Swanson,"You've fallen into a classic trap, Christopher trying to fix a woman's problems instead of just listening to what they are!"
Chris Traeger,Why are you yelling?
Ron Swanson,Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol, she can get it herself."
Tom Haverford,"What she needs from you is to just look her in the eyes, nod your head, and say those two magic words."
Donna Meagle,"""That sucks."""
Chris Traeger,"""That sucks""?"
Tom Haverford,I spent my entire life reading instructional books about relationships in order to trick women into liking me.
Tom Haverford,"When Ann tells you what's bothering her, don't try to fix it."
Tom Haverford,"Just say, ""Damn, that sucks."""
Ron Swanson,The songs just play one right after the other!
Ron Swanson,This is an excellent rectangle!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is insane."
Leslie Knope,"It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is our motivation."
Ben Wyatt,We are not leaving this fountain until we've figured this out once and for all.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Why are you not supporting me on this?
Leslie Knope,I thought you agreed with me.
Ben Wyatt,"I do, as a person, but as city manager, I'm not 100% sure you have a case."
Ben Wyatt,You're not listening to my side.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, sometimes when we disagree, you're so passionate, I feel like I'm arguing with the sun."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is totally crazy!
Leslie Knope,I am super chill all the time!
Ben Wyatt,"Look, let's just admit it."
Ben Wyatt,We're in a weird position.
Ben Wyatt,We're married.
Ben Wyatt,"Our professional status has flipped, like, five times."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, now I'm your boss."
Ben Wyatt,"This is ""un-charded"" territory for us."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's nice."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,I learned from the best.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, forget firewalls."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's just be respectful and communicate, and we'll find the right balance."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I should have considered your side.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and you're also a very smart person."
Ben Wyatt,Let's get out of this fountain.
Leslie Knope,I can't because my legs are numb.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I can't move."
Ben Wyatt,Are we gonna die here?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, don't do that."
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't like this game.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't know what the rules are!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, babe, here's what I did."
Andy Dwyer,Tell me if this is appropriate for a kids' song.
Andy Dwyer,"I changed the lyrics in Sex Hair to You got sex bears you got 'em from me, kids sexbears big ol' sex bears"
April Ludgate,"Andy, the word ""hair"" was not the problem with Sex Hair."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's sex! Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer,Now what the hell am I supposed to sing?
Craig Middlebrooks,"It's time, Andrew."
Craig Middlebrooks,"These kids are tearing my house apart, and I need you to calm them with the power of song."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, gosh, here's the thing-- I can't do it."
Andy Dwyer,I got laryngitis.
Craig Middlebrooks,"You will not bail on me, Andrew Dwyer."
Craig Middlebrooks,You will perform.
Craig Middlebrooks,"My nephew is something of an outcast in his school, and I got Erica Swarvane to come, which is a huge get."
Craig Middlebrooks,She rules the first grade.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And this party will determine his social status for the next hundred years! So you better get out there, or I am going to lose it!"
April Ludgate,Have you not lost it?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, you don't even know!"
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm freaking out."
April Ludgate,Listen to me.
April Ludgate,You make up songs all the time off the top of your head.
April Ludgate,You do.
April Ludgate,"You can do this, and afterwards, we can have cake."
Andy Dwyer,I already had cake.
April Ludgate,Andy!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, focus up, you little monsters! Not you, Erica."
Craig Middlebrooks,"You're an angel, and we're thrilled you're here."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Now, is everyone ready to hear the best music you've ever heard in your miserable little lives?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, then, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome-- what even do you call yourself? Oh, it's too late! Please welcome Johnny Karate and his magical guitar stick!"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh It feels super good it's super fun I wanna do it all the time pick your nose 'Cause boogers are gross clean out your snout You can pick your nose with your smelly toes Ew! He's doing it! You're picking your nose, and you put it on your friend! Ha-ha, I started that."
Andy Dwyer,Great! Everybody pees the bed just something that we do I for instance peed the bed until I was 32.
Andy Dwyer,Don't play with matches they're really not safe your parents keep 'em in a drawer with twist ties and batteries
Andy Dwyer,My name is Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,I investigate stinky feet for the FBI.
Andy Dwyer,Stinky feet patrol stinky feet patrol Stinky feet patrol! Stinky feet patrol!
Andy Dwyer,This is so fun.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot believe this only cost me 150 bucks.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey."
Chris Traeger,How was your day?
Ann Perkins,It was okay.
Ann Perkins,Now my legs really hurt.
Ann Perkins,"It's like I have a tension headache, but in my calves."
Ann Perkins,A new surprise every day.
Chris Traeger,That sucks.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,And I'm so gassy.
Ann Perkins,"There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking this morning."
Chris Traeger,That really sucks.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,It does.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry that I was trying to fix all your problems.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I was such a freak.
Ann Perkins,"You're the nicest, most thoughtful baby daddy a girl could ask for."
Craig Middlebrooks,That was incredible.
Craig Middlebrooks,"You are overflowing with talent, and I admire you."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Extra,Excuse me.
Extra,Mr. Karate?
Andy Dwyer,Mr. Karate!
Extra,My son wants you to sing at his birthday party next weekend.
Extra,Are you available?
April Ludgate,"He is, but it's actually $250 for short notice."
April Ludgate,You can call this number and ask for April Karate.
Extra,"Yes, I will."
April Ludgate,Babe
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,That was amazing.
April Ludgate,I kind of think you can make a career out of this.
Andy Dwyer,"But, I mean, I don't know."
Andy Dwyer,What does that make me-- a kids' performer? I'm supposed to be a rock star.
Andy Dwyer,You just had fun in there and made $150.
April Ludgate,Who cares about what you were supposed to be?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Plus, you have never been sexier to me than when you were singing to those kids just now."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's weird."

Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this was a terrible idea."

Ben Wyatt,Bleh.
