Harris,Welcome to Animal Control.
Harris,Let me show you around.
Harris,Those are some chairs.
Harris,That's a cat or opossum.
Harris,"Oh, this is a napkin where I wrote down a cool name for a dog."
Harris,"""Bark Obama."""
Brett,Right?
Leslie Knope,Is that what's happening here?
Brett,Oh.
Brett,Yo.
Brett,Yeah.
Brett,We found this bird outside.
Brett,"We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones."
Brett,"Tougher than it looked, though."
Leslie Knope,"We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals."
Leslie Knope,They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
Leslie Knope,This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pothead losers.
Leslie Knope,It's completely and utterly mismanaged.
Harris,Thanks!
Chris Traeger,"It does seem to be very poorly run, but we've only been here for two minutes."
Chris Traeger,There may be a method to their madness.
Chris Traeger,There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Brett,Four.
Brett,There's four ways to skin a cat.
Brett,Regular blade
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,What is this?
Harris,"Coyote trap, dude."
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,This hurts!
Brett,"Yeah, we got, like, a huge vermin problem."
Brett,"I mean, we've been meaning to call somebody about it, but you know, nobody get on the phone."
Leslie Knope,You're the people you would be calling.
Harris,That is so trippy.
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,The whole department is fired.
Chris Traeger,"Ow, this hurts!"
Chris Traeger,This was one of my running feet!
Brett,"Yo, let's go to Jamaica."
Harris,"No, we should go to Jamaica."
Harris,"Oh, is that what you said?"
Brett,"Yeah, dog."
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you've been sweating in here all day."
Ann Perkins,Are you drinking any fluids?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, plenty."
Ann Perkins,"No, you need to drink water."
Ron Swanson,"Usually, I take it neat, but I will make an exception in the name of health."
Ron Swanson,"Last night, I watched a movie with Diane and the girls in which an orange fish is separated from his father."
Ron Swanson,"The children were sniffling, which I believed to be due to the sad nature of the film."
Ron Swanson,I was wrong.
Ann Perkins,"You need to take off those layers, rehydrate, and go to the doctor."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your concern, I will be fine."
Ron Swanson,Please turn the thermostat up to 90 and leave me alone.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, this isn't safe."
Ron Swanson,I am a grown man.
Ron Swanson,"I have had a cold before, I need no help, so if you don't mind"
Ann Perkins,That seems about right.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, pop quiz."
Tom Haverford,Name the scent.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, ""Spasm."""
Ben Wyatt,"No, ""Butter Face""!"
Tom Haverford,Very good!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"I'm trying to get more big companies to donate to the Sweetums Foundation, and tom got us a meeting with Dennis Feinstein, Pawnee's premiere manufacturer of perfumes and cologne."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Or possibly, insecticide."
Ben Wyatt,Whew!
Tom Haverford,"Dennis Feinstein belongs to a new generation of wealth rappers, tech geniuses, X games medallists, and of course, ""scent artists."""
Tom Haverford,The man owns a Rolexus.
Tom Haverford,It's a Lexus filled with Rolexes.
Ben Wyatt,What's the point of that?
Tom Haverford,"To have it, which he does."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll lay out the benefits of donating."
Ben Wyatt,Tom will flatter and schmooze as only tom can.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, you know, this is just a learning experience for you, so you just watch and listen."
Tom Haverford,"I had to pull a lot of strings to get this meeting, so please, no one embarrass me."
Tom Haverford,"Ben, put on something decent, like a tux."
Tom Haverford,"Andy, you're hopeless, just take a shower."
Andy Dwyer,"I already took what I call a ""dwyer shower."""
Andy Dwyer,I rubbed my armpits with air fresheners.
Andy Dwyer,New car.
Leslie Knope,Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich got his start there.
Councilman Howser,Well.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm way ahead of you there, girly."
Jeremy Jamm,I got the perfect guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Friend of mine, bit of an alcoholic, a little grabby, either a war hero or war criminal, depending on who you ask, but a good dude."
Chris Traeger,How do you know him?
Jeremy Jamm,I do his teeth.
Jeremy Jamm,"A few coffee stains up front, but his canines are insane."
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect."
Leslie Knope,Are his gums great too?
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"They are excellent, beet red."
Leslie Knope,I was being sarcastic.
Leslie Knope,I think we should open this to the floor for more discussion.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, maybe you would like to explain this to her, please?"
Councilman Howser,"Traditionally, Leslie, the councilmen just kind of take turns on departmental appointments."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, this one is mine, then Dexhart, then you."
Jeremy Jamm,This whole place runs on dibs.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,You guys are all fine with this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?"
Leslie Knope,This is how departments get mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are going to be thorough.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them."
Jeremy Jamm,Boring!
Leslie Knope,"""Boring"" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I guess I'm leaving."
Chris Traeger,Good to see you.
Chris Traeger,Great meeting!
Ron Swanson,I'd like to object again to being brought here against my will.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm just gonna doublecheck your form here."
Ann Perkins,Ron!
Ann Perkins,You redacted all the information.
Ron Swanson,I answered some of them.
Ann Perkins,"For ""date of birth,"" you wrote ""springtime."""
Ron Swanson,Which is true.
Ann Perkins,Everything you write down is confidential.
Ann Perkins,We need you to give real answers.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ann Perkins,How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
Ron Swanson,One.
Ann Perkins,"That's it, one drink?"
Ron Swanson,One shelf.
Ann Perkins,Do you exercise?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Lovemaking and woodworking.
Ann Perkins,Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?
Ron Swanson,I have an uncle who does yoga.
Ann Perkins,Allergies?
Ron Swanson,Cowardice and weak willed men.
Ron Swanson,And hazelnuts.
Ann Perkins,Sexual history.
Ron Swanson,Epic and private.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go get your doctor.
Ann Perkins,"He's a rude, brash jerk."
Ann Perkins,You'll love him.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't like charity.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't get it.
Dennis Feinstein,"Feels to me like I'm giving money away, and getting nothing in return."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not true."
Ben Wyatt,You can really help your personal brand if you show that you're a mogul that gives as much as he gets.
Dennis Feinstein,"If I give as much as I get, I'm giving 20 million dollars."
Dennis Feinstein,Ay yi yi.
Dennis Feinstein,"That's how much I'm worth, 20 million dollars. Yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, he's disgusting, but I want to take his money and give it to needy people, so I'm just gonna keep on smiling."
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,"People who give to charity, they get amazing press."
Dennis Feinstein,Huh.
Andy Dwyer,Like Bill Gates.
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever heard of Bill Gates?
Andy Dwyer,"He lives in Seattle, guy with glasses."
Andy Dwyer,Bill Gates?
Dennis Feinstein,I know who Bill Gates is.
Dennis Feinstein,"Bill Gates is, like, a super nerd."
Dennis Feinstein,Is this some sort of nerd thing?
Dennis Feinstein,Are you calling me a nerd?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, he meant Mark Cuban."
Dennis Feinstein,Cuban?
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, that's the kind of guy I can hang out with Mark Cuban."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm interested now.
Dennis Feinstein,Keep talking.
April Ludgate,Stay still.
Chris Traeger,"""Don't think about how much this itches."""
Chris Traeger,That's very good advice.
Leslie Knope,"I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head."
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.
Chris Traeger,I'm not going to lie to you.
Chris Traeger,I needed that.
Chris Traeger,I know.
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate is beautiful
April Ludgate,Stop.
Leslie Knope,You are talented
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you're passionate about animals."
April Ludgate,That's true.
April Ludgate,It's because I'm half wolf.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate."
Harris,Wassup?
Harris,I'm Harris.
Harris,I'm 33 years young.
Harris,I have my cousin Jason's truck for two more weeks.
Harris,I have one testicle whacamole accident and I'm down to clown.
Chris Traeger,"Harris, we know who you are."
Chris Traeger,I literally just fired you.
Harris,"Oh, is this that job?"
Harris,That's crazy!
Harris,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?
Donna Meagle,'Cause he's one of only two applicants with actual experience at animal control.
Leslie Knope,Uhohh.
Leslie Knope,Does that mean
Brett,What up?
Brett,"Yo, my name is Brett."
Brett,"I like burgers, and also, I'm very high right now."
Harris,"Dude, this is hilarious!"
Brett,"Oh, yo!"
Harris,We live together!
Brett,"Yo, we live in the same place!"
Harris,This is my boy!
Brett,"Hey, ""Wyld Stallyns""!"
April Ludgate,You guys know why there are all those cops out there?
Brett,Where are the cops at?
Harris,I gotta go.
Brett,Yo.
Ben Wyatt,"A lot of charities waste their money on overhead, but we at the Sweetums Foundation, spend our money wisely."
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,You know what?
Dennis Feinstein,Shut up.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Dennis Feinstein,"You guys seem like pretty cool dudes and I'm feeling pretty generous, so why don't we take this conversation to the Pawnee Smokehouse?"
Dennis Feinstein,"Dumb Dumb Eddie, get the checkbook."
Dennis Feinstein,We're going out.
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Guys, we're going out."
Dennis Feinstein,Let's scent up!
Tom Haverford,"I call dibs on ""Ooze."""
Andy Dwyer,"I got ""Money Shot."""
Dennis Feinstein,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I got ""Blood Spurt."
Dennis Feinstein,"Ooh, no, don't use that one."
Dennis Feinstein,"Eh, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,So why do you want this job?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I love cats, and dogs sure are great."
Chris Traeger,"Well, you have all the qualifications."
Chris Traeger,You went to a four year college.
Jerry Gergich,"Actually, when I went there, it was just a two year college."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, geez."
April Ludgate,You're fired.
April Ludgate,Get out.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, you're not fired, but we're definitely going to have to lower your salary."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, fair's fair."
Extra,"I am very, very, very, very frightened of animals."
Leslie Knope,This may not be the job for you.
Extra,"I know, but my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, told me to confront my fears."
Chris Traeger,You see Dr. Richard Nygard?
Chris Traeger,I'm a Nygardian too!
Chris Traeger,Would you sign my cast?
Extra,"Yes, but just please don't give me this job."
Extra,"The spaying and neutering tools, do you think those fit humans?"
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
Extra,And is there a lock on the spaying room door?
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming in.
Extra,Thanks for having me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Orin."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for applying, now leave."
April Ludgate,"Hey, give him a chance."
April Ludgate,What makes you qualified for animal control?
Orin,"I studied zoology in college, and I can control animals with my mind."
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Orin,I made you say that.
Chris Traeger,I liked him.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates."
Chris Traeger,I think you've got several options.
Chris Traeger,"They're all terrible, but you have them."
Ron Swanson,"Before you begin, a few ground rules."
Ron Swanson,"I need you to explain everything you do before you do it, so I can determine whether I will allow you Oh!"
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Balsa wood?
Ron Swanson,You could at least use mahogany.
Dr. Harris,There's something occluding your ear.
Ron Swanson,It's sawdust.
Ron Swanson,Just blow.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Dr. Harris,You've got strep throat.
Dr. Harris,I'm writing you a prescription for penicillin.
Ann Perkins,We'll have the rest of your test results in about 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,Cholesterol
Ron Swanson,Not interested.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Dr. Harris,Wish all patients were like that.
Dr. Harris,It's really annoying when they ask questions.
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, they claim that smoking is bad for you, but is there any medical evidence to back that up?"
Tom Haverford,Great point.
Ben Wyatt,So the Sweetums Foundation has really accomplished a lot recently.
Ben Wyatt,Our health care outreach program has reduced pink eye in the rural community by 30% to 70%.
Dennis Feinstein,Snooze.
Dennis Feinstein,You guys ever been fox hunting?
Dennis Feinstein,I have my own foxes flown in from Russia.
Dennis Feinstein,We drug them pretty heavily so they can't get very far.
Dennis Feinstein,"In fact, mostly, they just flop around on the ground."
Dennis Feinstein,"Makes it easier to just walk up and ""pow!"""
Dennis Feinstein,Stupid foxes.
Dennis Feinstein,It's deeply erotic.
Tom Haverford,That sounds amazing.
Dennis Feinstein,We should go hunting sometime.
Tom Haverford,I'd love to.
Tom Haverford,I could bust out my Ralph Lauren Fall 2010 collection.
Tom Haverford,Copped it in 2012.
Tom Haverford,Clearance rack!
Dennis Feinstein,"Wear whatever you want, as long as it's not too bright or reflective."
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, I want you blending in to the surroundings."
Dennis Feinstein,How fast can you run?
Tom Haverford,I think that guy wants to hunt me.
Ben Wyatt,"So, Dennis, not to interrupt"
Dennis Feinstein,Then don't.
Dennis Feinstein,Boom!
Dennis Feinstein,Ha ha!
Dennis Feinstein,Shut him right down!
Dennis Feinstein,I have heard so much talking from you.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't want to hear your fat mouth say anything else.
Dennis Feinstein,Boo!
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,You're a dick.
Dennis Feinstein,Excuse me?
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Dennis Feinstein,How dare you talk to me like that?
Dennis Feinstein,Where are your manners?
Dennis Feinstein,"You come to me asking for money, and you treat me like this?"
Dennis Feinstein,I don't think so.
Dennis Feinstein,Wrap it up!
Dennis Feinstein,We're done!
Dennis Feinstein,Hey!
Dennis Feinstein,Show these garbage people out!
Dennis Feinstein,"Take the garbage out, Eddie."
Tom Haverford,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Palletta, what is your occupation currently?"
Extra,"I run a children's break dancing studio called ""D.J. Jazzy Vern's."""
Leslie Knope,Do you have any experience with animals?
Extra,"Uh, a bat landed on my face once."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him."
Jeremy Jamm,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer."
Extra,How many more questions are there gonna be?
Extra,"Jamm said if I got my teeth whitened, I'd just get the gig."
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, ga ga gaho."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, that's enough."
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, you're done."
Jeremy Jamm,"You did a heck of a job, Vernie."
Extra,"Thanks, Jimbo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not bad, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, if he can catch raccoons as well as he can teach six year olds to pop and lock, he's a home run."
Leslie Knope,That is an insane statement.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I don't see anyone better."
Leslie Knope,"April, I got a present for you."
April Ludgate,I don't like lotion.
April Ludgate,I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?"
Leslie Knope,"Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons."
Jerry Gergich,I was just happy to be considered.
Leslie Knope,"Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes."
Leslie Knope,Surprise.
April Ludgate,"No, I don't want the job."
April Ludgate,You can have your mud and blood back.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, you will be so good at it."
Leslie Knope,You are so good with animals.
April Ludgate,"Even if I wanted the job, I don't want to do the stupid confirmation hearing, okay?"
April Ludgate,Stupid councilmen asking me stupid questions about my stupid life it seems stupid.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's easy they'll just ask you a few questions."
Leslie Knope,Let's practice.
Leslie Knope,What's your name?
April Ludgate,Batman.
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,I failed.
Leslie Knope,"I will be there to help you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will be your Pocahontas.
Leslie Knope,Climb into my papoose.
Leslie Knope,Please do this.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do it.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
April Ludgate,But only if you divorce Ben.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, don't even joke about that."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I really think he's wrong for you.
Councilman Howser,We now resume the confirmation proceedings for director of the Animal Control Department.
Jeremy Jamm,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant."
April Ludgate,Andy?
April Ludgate,That's my husband.
Councilman Dexhart,"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us."
Councilman Dexhart,"I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak."
April Ludgate,Those are personal.
April Ludgate,No one's allowed to read those.
Jeremy Jamm,You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.
Jeremy Jamm,How do you justify that?
April Ludgate,Easily.
April Ludgate,Alcohol is delicious and fun
Leslie Knope,Damentally a substance that should not be abused.
Leslie Knope,"I agree, April."
Leslie Knope,Very good point.
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth."
Jeremy Jamm,Would you like to put her on your knee?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that'd be really fun."
Jeremy Jamm,"Just three years ago, you drove"
Chris Traeger,She is not ready.
Chris Traeger,"Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction."
Leslie Knope,Grab that gavel and break your other foot.
Chris Traeger,"I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives."
Leslie Knope,Don't panic.
Leslie Knope,Maybe she can pull this off.
April Ludgate,"I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt."
Leslie Knope,Okay! Let's take a brief recess.
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, well, well."
Dennis Feinstein,Look who's back.
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir."
Ben Wyatt,We just came to apologize.
Andy Dwyer,"Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad."
Andy Dwyer,"I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it."
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you for saying that.
Dennis Feinstein,"Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven."
Dennis Feinstein,"To that end, here is a check for 25,000 dollars for your charity."
Dennis Feinstein,"Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing."
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. Feinstein, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,This is extremely generous.
Dennis Feinstein,"It's nothing, really."
Dennis Feinstein,I'm happy to help.
Ben Wyatt,"This check is made out to ""Go [bleep] yourself."""
Dennis Feinstein,In your face! Dennis Feinstein helps no man! Get the hell out of my office!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's your problem, man? -"
Andy Dwyer,Why did you make me - apologize to him?
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay? Mr. Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick."
Dennis Feinstein,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,Run!
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie, get my crossbow."
Andy Dwyer,- Crossbow? What the--
Dennis Feinstein,You will pay for this!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you look better."
Ann Perkins,I guess actual medicine can be effective.
Ann Perkins,Who'da thunk?
Ron Swanson,Please leave me alone.
Ann Perkins,Not until we go over your test results and your blood work.
Ann Perkins,Your blood pressure looks fine.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen."
Ron Swanson,"What's ""cholesterol""?"
Ann Perkins,"And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile."
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you."
Ron Swanson,"I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die."
Ann Perkins,That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.
Ann Perkins,"You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron."
Ann Perkins,"You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana."
Leslie Knope,"I am so sorry, April."
Leslie Knope,"You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault."
Leslie Knope,"It's not you, it's me."
April Ludgate,Are you breaking up with me?
Leslie Knope,I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.
Leslie Knope,He does have good teeth.
April Ludgate,"No! All right, I have an idea."
April Ludgate,Trust me.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible."
Jeremy Jamm,Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,But neither is your guy.
April Ludgate,Neither of us should get the job.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no? Why is that?"
April Ludgate,There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.
April Ludgate,"Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that."
April Ludgate,So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,That is a genius idea.
Leslie Knope,Somebody wake up Milton.
Leslie Knope,History is being made.
Councilman Milton,Iwo Jima!
April Ludgate,"Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies."
Chris Traeger,"Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense."
Jeremy Jamm,Hang on a second.
Jeremy Jamm,"You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope he kept a receipt."
Leslie Knope,"That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec."
Councilman Howser,I second that.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Look at that, April."
Leslie Knope,You won over Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, no, she didn't."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just sick of being on the losing side.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.
Jeremy Jamm,Retro-jammed.
Andy Dwyer,What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing.
Tom Haverford,Screw that.
Tom Haverford,You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.
Ben Wyatt,"God, we really could've used the money, though."
Ben Wyatt,Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.
Tom Haverford,"You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month."
Tom Haverford,"It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help."
Ben Wyatt,"That's very generous, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Feinstein's the worst.
Ben Wyatt,I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.
Tom Haverford,"For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it."
Leslie Knope,"April, I have a gift for you."
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Chris Traeger,"At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department."
Chris Traeger,"You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing."
April Ludgate,How did you make this plaque so quickly?
Leslie Knope,I had it made your first week here.
Leslie Knope,"I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared."
April Ludgate,Can I hire an intern?
Leslie Knope,Not yet.
April Ludgate,Can I hire a Mexican elf?
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Can I buy a child bride?
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Then how is this even a promotion?
Leslie Knope,Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.
Leslie Knope,It should operate based on good ideas.
Leslie Knope,"April had the best idea, and today the best idea won."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, right, sorry."
Chris Traeger,You don't have to come in with me.
Leslie Knope,I wasn't going to.
Chris Traeger,Could you pick up the pace a little bit?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Miss Daisy."
Donna Meagle,"Night, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,"Night, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Ladies, ladies."
