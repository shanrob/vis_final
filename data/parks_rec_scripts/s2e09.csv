Paul,Okay.
Paul,"As everybody knows, The Spirit of Pawnee was defaced again last night."
Leslie Knope,What was it this time?
Paul,Chocolate pudding.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,That's new.
Leslie Knope,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it's very controversial.
Leslie Knope,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce."
Leslie Knope,Someone tried to stab it once.
Leslie Knope,We really need better security here.
Leslie Knope,"We also need better, less offensive history."
Paul,"So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying."
Paul,"Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural."
Paul,And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.
Paul,"All righty, folks?"
Paul,Thank you very much.
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Leslie."
Joe From Sewage,What's your design going to be?
Joe From Sewage,A tree?
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you work in Sewage."
Leslie Knope,Your department literally specializes in crap.
Leslie Knope,You really want to do this?
Joe From Sewage,I told you before.
Joe From Sewage,"""Crap"" is a slang term."
Joe From Sewage,And I don't like that term.
Joe From Sewage,"But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys."
Joe From Sewage,Sewage.
Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.
Tom Haverford,Damn!
Tom Haverford,How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever."
Leslie Knope,This could be our legacy.
Ann Perkins,I thought building a park on Lot 48 was going to be our legacy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can have two legacies."
Leslie Knope,Look at Madonna.
Leslie Knope,"Great singer, amazing arms."
Tom Haverford,Look at O.J. Simpson.
Tom Haverford,"Heisman Trophy winner, Naked Gun."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Donna Meagle,"No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not true, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I've seen your fingernails.
Donna Meagle,"Um, I pay someone to do this."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, shoot."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, only Ron can order the whole department to do something."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Order them to do this.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever Leslie says.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, here are your supplies."
Leslie Knope,I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And make me a sketch.
Leslie Knope,And it needs to be breath-taking and moving and historical and better than every department.
Leslie Knope,And you have one hour.
Leslie Knope,Designers.
Leslie Knope,Make it work.
Leslie Knope,Tim Gunn.
Andy Dwyer,"You, my friend, are ready to go dancing."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, sir."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Ron Swanson,Andrew.
Ron Swanson,Looking good.
Ron Swanson,Business is booming.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, how about you?"
Andy Dwyer,Need a little dog waxing?
Andy Dwyer,"It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy."
Kyle,What?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Beat it.
Andy Dwyer,This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.
Ron Swanson,I'm impressed with Andy.
Ron Swanson,Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.
Ron Swanson,He reminds me of me.
Ron Swanson,I got my first job when I was nine.
Ron Swanson,Worked at a sheet metal factory.
Ron Swanson,"In two weeks, I was running the floor."
Ron Swanson,Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Andy Dwyer,Do you have a key in your shoe?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe."
Ron Swanson,"Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors."
Ron Swanson,"But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That was neat.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hey."
Andy Dwyer,We are all finished.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was great."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Andy Dwyer,No sweat.
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Kyle,You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Kyle,It's not good business.
Andy Dwyer,You want to know what else isn't good business?
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my friend.
Kyle,Right.
Kyle,I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry Kyle.
Andy Dwyer,Here.
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.
Andy Dwyer,Next.
Artist,"So, what are you looking for exactly?"
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."
Tom Haverford,"""The spirit of Pawnee."""
Tom Haverford,That's all I got.
Tom Haverford,Here.
Tom Haverford,Just give me 20 dollars worth of art.
Tom Haverford,"Just something that seems personal, that only I could have done."
Artist,Tell me about yourself.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Just paint.
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in art.
Tom Haverford,Let me clarify.
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in non-nude images.
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?"
Tom Haverford,It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.
Artist,I'm an abstract expressionist.
Tom Haverford,"No, you're a con artist."
Tom Haverford,And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Ann Perkins,I'm a terrible artist.
Ann Perkins,"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.
Leslie Knope,I know everything about this town and these murals.
Leslie Knope,And that's why this is a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.
Leslie Knope,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering."
Leslie Knope,"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me."
Leslie Knope,"At one point, Gina Gershon was there."
April Ludgate,My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"I never understood the term ""elbow grease."""
Andy Dwyer,I guess it's not really grease.
Andy Dwyer,Just hard work.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Nice, shiny shoes you got there."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hey."
Ron Swanson,"I was just, I thinkâ¦"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,Shoot.
Ron Swanson,"Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one."
Andy Dwyer,"Do you need your money back, Ron?"
Andy Dwyer,Because I already spent it.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,How did... Never mind.
Ron Swanson,I think I'll just take another full polish.
Ron Swanson,Can I cut in line again?
Andy Dwyer,I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.
Andy Dwyer,"I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go first."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Um... Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park."
Ann Perkins,With dogs playing.
Ann Perkins,"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine."
Tom Haverford,That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I tried."
Tom Haverford,And you failed.
Ann Perkins,It's dogs and people playing in a park.
Ann Perkins,It's cute.
Tom Haverford,"It's okay, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford,"You can't make art, because you are art."
Tom Haverford,You're beautiful.
Tom Haverford,But that sucks.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Let's see yours.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Mine is amazing.
Tom Haverford,It's going to blow your mind.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,This is some professional-ass art right here.
Leslie Knope,I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.
Tom Haverford,"It's abstract, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"Over here, you've got some shapes."
Tom Haverford,"And then you come over to this side... You know, it's actually kind of interesting."
Tom Haverford,Each shape is its own thing.
Tom Haverford,"But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of... completion."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.
Tom Haverford,Is that normal?
Donna Meagle,"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana."
Donna Meagle,"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox."
Donna Meagle,"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey."
Donna Meagle,Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.
Donna Meagle,"So, a NASCAR."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, my friend, Becky."
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,Who's the Jesus?
Donna Meagle,That would be Greg Kinnear.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know he was from Indiana.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you know, I read that he was."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he was great on ER."
Tom Haverford,Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he was."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that he was.
Leslie Knope,Who am I thinking of?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Next?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Really good, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,"For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma."
Tom Haverford,"You said ""murinal."""
Jerry Gergich,"She... No, I didn't."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Ann Perkins,"You said ""murinal."""
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, she--"
April Ludgate,Jerry.
April Ludgate,Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?
Tom Haverford,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Go to the doctor.
Tom Haverford,You might have a murinary tract infection.
Jerry Gergich,I just wanted to show you my art.
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Leslie Knope,Disqualified!
Jerry Gergich,It's pointillism.
Jerry Gergich,And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.
Tom Haverford,No one cares.
Tom Haverford,At all.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So, this is a multimedia project."
April Ludgate,"First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage."
April Ludgate,And this is a TV screen.
April Ludgate,"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries."
April Ludgate,And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.
April Ludgate,"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding."
April Ludgate,"And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff."
April Ludgate,"And that'll be, like, right next to the mural."
Leslie Knope,I have one question.
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"If you have to ask, you don't get it."
Leslie Knope,I don't think they really got the assignment.
Leslie Knope,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time."
Leslie Knope,Like the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope,Or the music of Squeeze.
Leslie Knope,"June 8, 1922."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.
Leslie Knope,We lost a lot of good bread that day.
Leslie Knope,As well as several human lives.
Leslie Knope,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.
Leslie Knope,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing."""
Leslie Knope,But I digress.
Leslie Knope,The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.
Tom Haverford,Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history."
Leslie Knope,And people love voting for tragedy.
Leslie Knope,Look at the Oscars.
Leslie Knope,This is our Holocaust movie.
Leslie Knope,"This is our ""English Patient."""
Ann Perkins,It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ann gets it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Time to vote, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Cast your votes.
Leslie Knope,"May the best, most tragic project win."
Leslie Knope,"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural."
Leslie Knope,And then those six voices came together as a team.
Leslie Knope,There are no losers today.
Leslie Knope,"But there is one winner, us."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, the results of the vote, please."
Tom Haverford,One to one to one to one to one to one.
Leslie Knope,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Third time today.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,That's a good shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep] man?
Ron Swanson,I I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,Frankly.
Ron Swanson,I emitted a noise.
Ron Swanson,The noise was involuntary.
Ron Swanson,"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound."
Ron Swanson,You know?
Leslie Knope,We need to whittle these down.
Leslie Knope,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?
April Ludgate,Ann's blows.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Don't hold back.
April Ludgate,"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park."
April Ludgate,That's not art.
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat."
April Ludgate,You don't even work here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you both have a point."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, yours was a little trite."
Leslie Knope,"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Look, there's something about those shapes."
Tom Haverford,There's some emotional art right there.
April Ludgate,Any kid could do that.
Tom Haverford,No kid could do that.
Tom Haverford,Only God could do that.
Donna Meagle,What is so great about the shapes?
Leslie Knope,"He likes the shapes, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And he's part of the team.
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.
Leslie Knope,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
Leslie Knope,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.
Leslie Knope,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.
Leslie Knope,Imagine how good that painting would be.
Leslie Knope,I think it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,Brendanawicz!
Leslie Knope,We need you for something.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can it wait?
Mark Brendanawicz,I am so swamped here.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in trouble.
Leslie Knope,We think it might be pills.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,But this is just as important.
Leslie Knope,We need you to look at a piece of art.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, God."
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Leslie Knope,This is our entry for the mural contest.
Leslie Knope,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you made a camel."
Mark Brendanawicz,You've never heard that saying?
Mark Brendanawicz,The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.
Mark Brendanawicz,And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.
Mark Brendanawicz,Featuring Bill Paxton.
Donna Meagle,Greg Kinnear.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,Greg Kinnear.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?
Leslie Knope,You have to save us.
Leslie Knope,You have to design something.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I'm not an artist."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you sketch things.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs."
Leslie Knope,That everybody stops and looks at.
Mark Brendanawicz,"By law, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,They're required to.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.
Leslie Knope,I know you'll do something good.
Leslie Knope,"And I really, really want to win this."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,What are you going to do tonight?
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park."
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh... The spirit of Pawnee?
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe?
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Ann Perkins,How is that better than my park scene?
April Ludgate,It isn't.
April Ludgate,And that's saying something.
Donna Meagle,And who's the man?
Donna Meagle,Is he famous?
Donna Meagle,Is it Martin Landau?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I have no dog in this fight."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm just saying that this will win.
Tom Haverford,It's nothing.
Tom Haverford,It's mush.
Tom Haverford,"There's not even one shape in there, Mark."
Tom Haverford,Where are the shapes?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not saying that this is any good.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm saying that this will win.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mass appeal.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it."
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,Who did this?
Ron Swanson,I like it.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,I mean... Sorry.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,It comforts me.
Ron Swanson,That'll win.
Tom Haverford,This is garbage.
Tom Haverford,We've got to go back to the shapes.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,This is boring.
April Ludgate,We got to go back to the garbage.
Ann Perkins,I would take the shapes over this.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, come on."
Donna Meagle,I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.
Donna Meagle,I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is the one.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Mark's right.
Tom Haverford,This is an outrage.
Tom Haverford,Mark's not even in the department.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,Neither is Ann.
Tom Haverford,But Ann's hot.
Tom Haverford,And that counts for something.
April Ludgate,"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!"""
April Ludgate,"""Rah rah rah!"""
April Ludgate,"""Down with the Sewage Department!"""
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason."
Leslie Knope,We have a reason.
Leslie Knope,We're going to win.
Leslie Knope,That's our reason.
Leslie Knope,Our designs are not going to win.
Leslie Knope,Mark's might win.
Leslie Knope,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?"
Leslie Knope,"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win."
Leslie Knope,We're going with this one.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"That is an order, team."
Leslie Knope,Go team!
Leslie Knope,Team dismissed.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are a team."
Leslie Knope,But I am the team leader.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made a bold decision."
Leslie Knope,We're playing it safe.
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Knope."
Joe From Sewage,How's life in the Parks Defartment?
Leslie Knope,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.
Leslie Knope,Which makes more sense.
Joe From Sewage,Whatever.
Joe From Sewage,You guys are screwed.
Joe From Sewage,Get used to this.
Joe From Sewage,Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.
Leslie Knope,That was pretty good.
Leslie Knope,You think they're going to win?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,They went super patriotic.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a classic mistake.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It seems crowd pleasing, but it's still a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,"And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,Us?
Mark Brendanawicz,Old man feeding pigeons?
Mark Brendanawicz,No stance.
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.
Leslie Knope,No point of view.
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I haven't been back.
Ron Swanson,I wish him good luck in his business.
Ron Swanson,"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon."
Ron Swanson,"I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Ron Swanson,"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?"
Andy Dwyer,"Other day, other day... Yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yesterday?"
Ron Swanson,I am... That... That... Was... I feel--
Andy Dwyer,"I'm okay-- You know, I'd be okay if we... I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again."
Ron Swanson,Never mention what again?
Andy Dwyer,"The moan, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,The weird moan you made.
Andy Dwyer,That was super weird.
Andy Dwyer,Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.
Andy Dwyer,She said she thought it was an animal--
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,It was just an odd moment.
Ron Swanson,"Let's just, let's just not talk about it anymore."
Andy Dwyer,That's what I was trying to say.
Andy Dwyer,"But, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Good time.
Chief Konner,Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope,Chief Konner.
Leslie Knope,What do you got there?
Chief Konner,"Well, we aren't really artists."
Chief Konner,But we gave it a shot.
Chief Konner,"It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's on fire theme."
Chief Konner,This is my nephew over here.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Chief Konner,And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.
Chief Konner,"Just some stuff we liked, you know? Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together."
Leslie Knope,"Well, good luck."
Chief Konner,Thanks.
Chief Konner,We think it's a winner.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,Camel's way more fun.
Leslie Knope,I want my team back.
Leslie Knope,"And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess."
Leslie Knope,"So, this is what we're going to submit."
Leslie Knope,Even if it means we lose.
Leslie Knope,"God, I hope we win."
Leslie Knope,But we're definitely going to lose.
Ann Perkins,Probably.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And Ann.
Ann Perkins,How Ann gets it done.
Donna Meagle,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Paul,What are the shapes?
Ann Perkins,"The shapes are awesome, is what they are."
Ann Perkins,You can't handle it.
Paul,"No, I actually like them."
Extra,Forgive me.
Extra,Is that Michael Jackson?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,The pride of Indiana.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,"So, it's relevant."
Extra,Who is he carrying?
Leslie Knope,Jesus Greg Kinnear.
Paul,"You know, it looks like he's carrying Kinnear into the burning building."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking."
Leslie Knope,"So, he should be going the other way."
Leslie Knope,That did not occur to me.
April Ludgate,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"So, there you go."
Leslie Knope,The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We didn't win.
Leslie Knope,But neither did anyone else.
Leslie Knope,They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.
Leslie Knope,"So, they're just going to restore the old one."
Leslie Knope,"They're changing the title to ""The Diversity Express."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
April Ludgate,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Donna Meagle,Ah! Look at that.
Tom Haverford,It's not as good as the other one.
Artist,"I don't know what you mean by ""good."""
Tom Haverford,Neither do I! Just do another one.
Artist,"You know, I have actual assignments that I have to finish for art school?"
Tom Haverford,Shut up and do more art for me.
Tom Haverford,This one's racist.
Tom Haverford,It's beautiful.
Tom Haverford,I've looked at this for five hours now.
Tom Haverford,I like the green one.
Tom Haverford,And the red circle right here.
Tom Haverford,"I'm tearing up, man."
