Bobby Newport,Hey.
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, guy."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, all right."
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,"You know, we're two days into this campaign, and so far it's going great."
Bobby Newport,"In fact, I don't know why they call it a ""campain."""
Bobby Newport,"Because up until now it's been a ""campleasure."""
Bobby Newport,"All right, hey, why don't we line up for autographs and free Bobby bars."
Bobby Newport,Huh?
Bobby Newport,Who wants a Bobby bar?
Leslie Knope,"Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune."
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
Leslie Knope,"He just entered the race, and he's already 70 points up in all the polls."
Leslie Knope,He is attractive and charming.
Leslie Knope,"And his family employs half the town, but so what?"
Leslie Knope,I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's wellversed in the issues.
Leslie Knope,And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
Bobby Newport,How's it going?
Bobby Newport,I'm Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport,But you probably knew that already.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Mr."
Leslie Knope,"Newport, we meet at last."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Bobby Newport,"Ah, okeydoke."
Bobby Newport,So do you want me to sign that to miss lope or just Nesney?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leslie's fine.
Bobby Newport,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, miss Knope is a candidate for city council."
Ben Wyatt,Been calling your office trying to set up a debate.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, no, you guys are wrong."
Bobby Newport,I'm running unopposed.
Bobby Newport,"I'm pretty sure I'm running unopposed, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, you're not running unopposed."
Leslie Knope,You've very opposed by me.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, terrific."
Bobby Newport,I love meeting people.
Bobby Newport,"I love it, yeah."
Bobby Newport,What do you guys do?
Leslie Knope,We just told you.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna be running for city council.
Bobby Newport,Great.
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,"Go ahead, my dad made 'em."
Extra,"Okay, folks."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Leslie Knope,I think we scared him.
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse or did they fire you because you slept with all the doctors?"
Ann Perkins,You wanna try that again?
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse?"
April Ludgate,Because Andy's not feeling well.
Ann Perkins,"What's wrong, Andy?"
Andy Dwyer,Just got a headache.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm seeing double.
Andy Dwyer,"And I got a song stuck in my head, and my teeth hurt."
Andy Dwyer,Also I'm hungry.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, some of those things are symptoms and some of them are just being a person."
Ann Perkins,Did you hit your head?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yes, technically I did smash my head area into the wall area."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he was hanging up his gold record."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm good."
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, I have a gold record."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I can help you with cuts and bruises but the other stuff you're gonna have to see a real doctor."
April Ludgate,"Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, smart ass, yes, you can."
Ann Perkins,You have insurance.
Andy Dwyer,Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.
Andy Dwyer,P.S. I haven't had it in years.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, we used to live together."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you still got it for me."
Bobby Newport,I'm Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport,My family owns nine square Miles of land in this town.
Bobby Newport,And isn't my family what this town's really about?
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Ann Perkins,That guy is everywhere.
Donna Meagle,I am not complaining.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we have to find a way to beat him."
Leslie Knope,And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ben, here's your great idea."
Leslie Knope,We're all ready for it.
Leslie Knope,And start.
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office.
Leslie Knope,I'm surrounded by my friends.
Leslie Knope,My campaign manager and I are in love.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr. Belvedere
Ben Wyatt,We are David.
Ben Wyatt,Newport is goliath.
Ben Wyatt,This is our slingshot.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we'll write an inspiring oped piece."
Ben Wyatt,"No, the Pawnee Eagleton high school basketball game."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, in this town it's bigger than the super bowl."
Ben Wyatt,"We take all our money, we air a TV ad right at halftime."
Ben Wyatt,And I think we should make an attack ad against Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Ann Perkins,That is a great idea!
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"Yay, it's a good idea."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, great."
Ben Wyatt,So let's get to work.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Ron Swanson,Present.
Chris Traeger,"I have a meeting at public works, and I was thinking that maybe you might wanna sit in."
Ron Swanson,Why would you think that?
Chris Traeger,"They are working on a number of fascinating, big budget projects"
Ron Swanson,I'm very busy here.
Chris Traeger,That I am being forced to brutally cut entirely.
Ron Swanson,I can make room in my schedule.
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,"As you know, I'm not a big fan of delivering bad news."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, it would be my absolute pleasure."
Ron Swanson,Have you considered cutting the entire fire department?
Ron Swanson,I've personally put out several local fires at no cost to the taxpayer.
Dr. Harris,Look to the left.
Dr. Harris,The right.
Dr. Harris,Whatever.
April Ludgate,Are you the kind of doctor who gets hooked on his own drugs?
April Ludgate,I bet you are.
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy, tell me what happened."
Andy Dwyer,"I was reading an encyclopedia, and I tripped or ""fell over"" and hit my head or brain helmet."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he sneezed and smacked his head against the wall."
Dr. Harris,That sounds about right.
Dr. Harris,"Well, if it's a concussion it's extremely mild, so I wouldn't worry about it."
Dr. Harris,Anything else bothering you?
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, yeah, I've got a weird rash in my knee pit area."
Andy Dwyer,"And my tongue, on this side, doesn't taste anything anymore."
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when I walk my ankles make, like, a weird rattlesnake sound."
Dr. Harris,What else?
Andy Dwyer,Things that are far away from my eyes are fuzzy.
Andy Dwyer,"I once at a twix with the wrapper on it, and I've never seen the wrapper come out."
Andy Dwyer,Also I've swallowed every piece of gum that I've chewed for the past 25 years.
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Just fix me.
Dr. Harris,"Well, I can help you with the thumb."
Dr. Harris,And I'll have to give you referrals for specialists for the other thousand things.
April Ludgate,"Wow, thanks for nothing, Dr. Harris"
Dr. Harris,You're welcome.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,I'm a regular guy.
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Bobby Newport,"I'm here with my persian greyhound raclette, who was given to me by my buddy, the pretender to the crown of Alsace-Lorraine."
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad."
Donna Meagle,"Nahuh, I always go negative."
Donna Meagle,Even if I like the guy I go negative.
Donna Meagle,Keeps 'em interested.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Donna."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it."
Leslie Knope,She's kind of freaking out right now.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, this magic marker smells like cherries."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, here's a question, do you like the idea?"
Leslie Knope,It's who
Leslie Knope,Do you like it?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you have a vision of how your campaign should go."
Ben Wyatt,"I am your chief strategist, so I'm sure we can work it out."
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just tell me what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, John, for coming in."
Chris Traeger,"The public works department is wonderful, and you are the best idea man in the business."
Ron Swanson,Also we're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
Extra,What?
Extra,What about the Pawnee river dam?
Ron Swanson,Dam's dead.
Ron Swanson,Have a nice day.
Extra,Where will all the water go?
Ron Swanson,Wherever it's headed now.
Ron Swanson,The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
Chris Traeger,We're very sorry.
Ron Swanson,I am not.
Ron Swanson,Good meeting.
Ben Wyatt,It's not a negative ad.
Ben Wyatt,"We're stating facts about him, and, yeah, they happen to be negative because he's a bonehead."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are our communications director."
Leslie Knope,Weigh in here.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I love your idea."
Tom Haverford,I also love your idea.
Tom Haverford,"Two great ideas, two great people."
Tom Haverford,"I don't know which idea's better, but I do know I'll end up on the winning side."
Tom Haverford,"When I bet on horses, I never lose."
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,I bet on all the horses.
Ben Wyatt,"How about we do this, we split up into teams, we each make a demo version of our ad."
Ben Wyatt,Whichever one we like better we use.
Tom Haverford,Great idea!
Tom Haverford,As long as Leslie thinks so as well.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team."
Leslie Knope,You can take Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you wanted to go negative."
Leslie Knope,"You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
Leslie Knope,So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Leslie Knope,Positive is always better than negative.
Leslie Knope,"Barack Obama said, ""yes we can,"" and now he's president."
Leslie Knope,"Ben says, ""no we shouldn't,"" and now he's working for his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I need double the smiles, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's take it back again.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,And this is going great.
Leslie Knope,We're really positive.
Leslie Knope,"I think we're getting good stuff, right?"
Leslie Knope,What's it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's bus was in that shot."
Leslie Knope,Do you think?
Andy Dwyer,"E, h, 4, m."
Andy Dwyer,Potato shape.
Andy Dwyer,Coffee mug shape.
Andy Dwyer,"Smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge."
Andy Dwyer,The rest are all smudges.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, you drove us here."
Andy Dwyer,"We made, like, 100 million doctors' appointments for ourselves in one week."
April Ludgate,"After this we won't have to go to the doctor for, like, ten years, because we're smart."
Extra,"Well, you definitely need glasses."
April Ludgate,"No, he's not getting glasses."
April Ludgate,I like his face the way it is.
April Ludgate,"If you get glasses, I'll divorce you."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you heard her, doc."
Andy Dwyer,"Too handsome for glasses, no offense."
Tom Haverford,"I gotta admit, his hair game's on point."
Tom Haverford,Gotta find out what kind of product he puts up in his hair.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's Leslie's ad going?"
Tom Haverford,It's very good.
Tom Haverford,But yours is also very good.
Jerry Gergich,You ready for the voiceover?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Tom Haverford,You gotta give it more attitude.
Tom Haverford,It's gotta scare people.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, okay."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby.
Tom Haverford,Bobby.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby.
Jerry Gergich,Newport.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, now we're just wasting time, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,I want to thank you for being so ruthless and cruel in the meeting the other day.
Ron Swanson,You'll have to be more specific.
Chris Traeger,With the public works department about the dam.
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Chris Traeger,What do you say I take you to lunch and then we can talk about all the projects that you want to get accomplished.
Ron Swanson,That won't be necessary.
Ron Swanson,I don't have any projects.
Ron Swanson,I hate projects.
Chris Traeger,What a pill.
Chris Traeger,We should order.
Chris Traeger,And then we can talk shop.
Chris Traeger,What are you gonna have?
Chris Traeger,I'm thinking something raw and cucumber based.
Chris Traeger,A cucumber.
Ron Swanson,I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,I declined his invitation.
Ron Swanson,He started laughing.
Ron Swanson,"And the next thing I knew, we were at lunch."
Ron Swanson,Did he drug me?
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,My dad is friends with John cougar mellencamp.
Bobby Newport,That's pretty cool.
Leslie Knope,"What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time?"
Ann Perkins,"Reminder, Leslie, we have less than an hour to get the ad to the station."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized."
Leslie Knope,"So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yay, the awesome one."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"I'm pro parks, pro public safety, and I'm pro clean water."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also pro environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro local propositions 45, 86, and 102F. But most of all, I'm pro Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Here are some other things that I'm pro.
Leslie Knope,"As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Charlie?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Tom Haverford,Fantastic.
Leslie Knope,Do we even want to screen yours?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, yeah, that was awful."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you never even mentioned you were running for office."
Ben Wyatt,"You literally never said the words ""city council."""
Leslie Knope,I did it's implied.
Leslie Knope,I didn't we can just put it in.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.
Ben Wyatt,"His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him."
Ben Wyatt,"His 60 foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten."
Ann Perkins,She has.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.
Ben Wyatt,Don't.
Ann Perkins,I won't.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, yes."
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, people, this is an ad."
Ben Wyatt,"It's succinct, it's punchy."
Leslie Knope,It's mean.
Leslie Knope,It's depressing.
Leslie Knope,It's awful.
Leslie Knope,"""I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams."""
Extra,"Okay, if you're allergic to any food, we'll know in a few days."
Andy Dwyer,I think based on the redness I might be allergic to getting stabbed by needles.
Andy Dwyer,"We have already been to, like, five different doctors."
Andy Dwyer,I got my ankles microwaved.
April Ludgate,Xrayed.
Andy Dwyer,They took my blood away to use for science.
April Ludgate,Cholesterol tests.
Andy Dwyer,April had her sinuses removed?
April Ludgate,Looked at.
Andy Dwyer,"Some guy looked at my wiener, touched it."
Andy Dwyer,That was weird.
April Ludgate,And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
Andy Dwyer,That What?
Leslie Knope,Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
Leslie Knope,So who's in favor of Ben's ad?
Leslie Knope,Traitors!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I painted your garage pink."
Ann Perkins,I did not ask you to do that.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better."
Leslie Knope,Our friendship is over.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,It's not over.
Leslie Knope,It's never over.
Leslie Knope,Bff.
Leslie Knope,I love you forever.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split."
Leslie Knope,I think we should keep debating.
Ben Wyatt,We're not split.
Ben Wyatt,It's unanimous.
Ben Wyatt,We air my ad.
Leslie Knope,But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
Ben Wyatt,"This is the right call, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to air a negative ad.
Leslie Knope,It's out of my hands now.
Leslie Knope,"But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this."
Extra,Are you are Ben Wyatt?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Extra,"Okay, I need that DVD in the control room."
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,"Give it to me, no"
Ben Wyatt,What are you Ah.
Tom Haverford,"Alright, the good news is, there's only two pieces of bad news."
Tom Haverford,"The bad news is, none of our ads aired and we cannot get our money back."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,There was probably a better way for you to tell us that.
Tom Haverford,You both really blew this.
Tom Haverford,But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
Tom Haverford,I love them already.
Tom Haverford,"Ooh, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a mango.
Tom Haverford,See ya.
Leslie Knope,I'm really sorry I tackled you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I really don't wanna crush your childhood dreams, but I bet in your dreams you weren't losing an election by 70 points."
Ben Wyatt,"You need to get tougher, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You just have to.
Leslie Knope,You need to get tougher.
Leslie Knope,You were pretty easy to take down.
Jerry Gergich,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,Just the man I wanted to see.
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to be going to a seminar on the art of the japanese tea ceremony Or chakai the Pawnee community college, and I thought you might like to come with me."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Chris Traeger,I know how much you value silence.
Ron Swanson,A fair point.
Ron Swanson,"But we did just have lunch last week, so I feel like we've spent enough social time together for the foreseeable Ever."
Chris Traeger,"All right, well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me."
Chris Traeger,Donna Meagle!
Donna Meagle,Chris Traeger!
Ron Swanson,For some godforsaken reason that man is suddenly determined to hang on with me.
Donna Meagle,You mean hang out?
Ron Swanson,What is wrong with him?
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, he's got you doing Ben's job, eating lunch with him like Ben used to."
Donna Meagle,Maybe he just misses his little buddy.
April Ludgate,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Let's get you home and get me some ice cream.
Extra,Here's your bill.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, yeah, won't be needing that."
Andy Dwyer,I've got the free medicine card.
Extra,"Uh, there's a $500 deductible for dental procedures."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I think you're wrong."
Andy Dwyer,We have the insurance thing.
Andy Dwyer,I believe we're covered.
Extra,It's still $500.
Andy Dwyer,Let's see here.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, because, you know what Let's go!"
Andy Dwyer,Dine and dash.
Andy Dwyer,Out of the way!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Whoohoohoo!
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, call an ambulance!"
Andy Dwyer,A different ambulance than the one I ran into.
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Leslie Knope when she was ten years old.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,I love Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And I want to make it even better.
Leslie Knope,"Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties."
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Bobby Newport today.
Bobby Newport,"People keep asking me: Bobby, what are you gonna do once you get into office?"
Bobby Newport,"Um, I'm pretty sure I'll figure it out."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope had better ideas when she was ten than Bobby Newport has now.
Ben Wyatt,They do have one thing in common.
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Leslie Knope,I like dogs.
Ben Wyatt,"For a better Pawnee, vote Knope for city council."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we already have a thousand views."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but no calls from reporters, no interview requests."
Leslie Knope,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,I'm proud of it.
Ben Wyatt,You sure?
Leslie Knope,"It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take"
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold that thought."
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,What a pleasant surprise.
Chris Traeger,And who's this?
Ron Swanson,This is a great friend of mine.
Ron Swanson,He is a fellow who works in the building and he is named Dennis.
Kyle,Kyle.
Ron Swanson,"He strongly enjoys japanese culture, and I thought he might wanna go with you to the thing."
Chris Traeger,The tea ceremony.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Chris Traeger,You're a brother japanophile?
Kyle,"I was eating rice, and Ron made me come up here."
Kyle,"But sure, that sounds fun."
Chris Traeger,Arigato.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, a moment."
Chris Traeger,"All right, pal, level with me."
Chris Traeger,What's going on?
Ron Swanson,"Well, you seemed like you wanted a friend."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,I'm not lonely.
Chris Traeger,I have me.
Chris Traeger,"And 4,000 Facebook friends and a hot girlfriend."
Chris Traeger,"I wanted to spend time with you, because I have to replace Ben as assistant city manager and I was giving you a tryout of sorts."
Chris Traeger,"Now, I'll mull my options for the next few months, but I'd love you to keep an open mind."
Chris Traeger,Kyle-San! Arigato!
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, hello."
Bobby Newport,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt.
Bobby Newport,"Yeah, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Good to see you.
Bobby Newport,Nice to see you.
Bobby Newport,"You guys want anything? This is a restaurant, so they have food and stuff."
Leslie Knope,I'll take a milkshake.
Ben Wyatt,We're good.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're good."
Leslie Knope,What can we do for you?
Bobby Newport,"Yes, um, why'd you guys post that video of me, man? I mean, that didn't make me feel good."
Bobby Newport,It was it was mean.
Bobby Newport,You guys are mean.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean."
Bobby Newport,"All right, let me lay it out for you."
Bobby Newport,My friends keep sending me links to that video and they just make fun of me.
Bobby Newport,"So just stop running, okay? Just that stop."
Leslie Knope,Stop running the ad?
Bobby Newport,"No, stop running the campaign."
Leslie Knope,What?
Bobby Newport,Just quit.
Bobby Newport,It would be so cool of you if you just quit.
Bobby Newport,"Then I can win the election, and I'll have a big party, and I'll put you both on the guest list, plus one."
Bobby Newport,I'm gonna have a man who does magic.
Bobby Newport,He's really good.
Bobby Newport,"Not, like, cheesy magic."
Bobby Newport,"Like, good magic."
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Leslie Knope,Why would we do that?
Bobby Newport,Because I want it.
Bobby Newport,"Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport,Give me it.
Bobby Newport,Give me it.
Bobby Newport,"Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport,Just give me the election.
Bobby Newport,"I'm sorry, please."
Bobby Newport,Please.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie, he does make a compelling argument."
Bobby Newport,"Come on, ugh! Come on, guy."
Leslie Knope,Bobby.
Bobby Newport,"- Ah, it's not padded!"
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question? Why are you even running for office?
Bobby Newport,"You know what, I need something to do to get my dad off my back."
Bobby Newport,This seemed easy.
Bobby Newport,"What about you, why are you doing it? Who's your dad?"
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
Bobby Newport,"What? What does that even mean? Hey, I've got an idea."
Bobby Newport,"How 'bout you quit running, then I win, but then I let you do all the work."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff."
Leslie Knope,So you should toughen up.
Bobby Newport,Why are you guys smiling? I feel bad.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, quick question."
Bobby Newport,That little girl from your video.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, my God, she's so cute."
Bobby Newport,Do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me?
Leslie Knope,That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
Bobby Newport,How'd you do that?
April Ludgate,Maybe you should see one of the other doctors.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No more doctors.
Andy Dwyer,They're a bunch of scam artists.
Andy Dwyer,They reel you in with the free stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Next thing you know, bam, you run into an ambulance."
Andy Dwyer,Every time.
Andy Dwyer,Let's just go home and care for each other.
Andy Dwyer,We could buy a sewing kit.
Andy Dwyer,You could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere.
April Ludgate,"Mmm, so romantic."
April Ludgate,"Oh, sorry, I forgot."
April Ludgate,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
