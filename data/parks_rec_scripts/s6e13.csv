Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were married one year ago this week at the Pawnee city hall."""
Leslie Knope,"""The bride wore a gown made by her friend Ann Perkins."""
Leslie Knope,"""And the groom wore a butt so perfect it could make an angel hang itself."""
Leslie Knope,"You wrote this, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,They cut it way down.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,So let's go over this again.
Ben Wyatt,What are the anniversary rules?
Leslie Knope,At lease 100 kisses.
Leslie Knope,Dinner at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,And no gifts.
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, no gifts."
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm getting him a gift."
Leslie Knope,I always say that I'm not gonna get him a gift.
Leslie Knope,And Ben always believes me.
Leslie Knope,"And then, bam, I surprise him with the best gift of all time."
Leslie Knope,"He makes the cutest, dopiest face when he's surprised."
Leslie Knope,It's like Whaaaat?
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna make my stupid surprise face this year because this time I got her the most amazing gift ever.
Ben Wyatt,"And she'll never see it coming because I'm giving it to her today, one day early."
Ben Wyatt,So she's gonna make the face this year.
Ben Wyatt,She will make that stupid face!

Derry Murbles,Welcome to Thought For Your Thoughts.
Derry Murbles,"I'm your Pawneean host, Derry Murbles."
August Clementine,"And I'm your Eagletonian host, August Clementine."
Derry Murbles,"Yes, if you have not heard our program in a while, Thought For Your Thoughts now has a cohost, thanks to the Pawnee Eagleton merger"
August Clementine,"I believe that is the Eagleton Pawnee merger, n'estce pas?"
Derry Murbles,I'd like to apologize to our listeners for my cohost's sudden and violent outburst just now.
Derry Murbles,Our guest is former city councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, thought--"
August Clementine,For your thoughts.
August Clementine,I said it.
Derry Murbles,"Absorb the aggression, Derry."
Derry Murbles,Absorb the aggression.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me."
Leslie Knope,It's a thrill to be here.
Leslie Knope,"As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun."
Leslie Knope,It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.
Leslie Knope,Things are going... okay.
Leslie Knope,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.
Leslie Knope,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.
Leslie Knope,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.
Leslie Knope,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.
August Clementine,"Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there were some bumps and bruises."
Leslie Knope,And a brief rash of arson.
Leslie Knope,And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.
Leslie Knope,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong."
August Clementine,Scoff.
Leslie Knope,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?"
Derry Murbles,"You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy."
Derry Murbles,"For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless."
August Clementine,This twerp has a name.
August Clementine,And it's August N'gutu Liebowitz-Clementine.
Leslie Knope,Guys... Hello.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.
Jerry Gergich,It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on."
Ben Wyatt,"She has to make that face, do you understand?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed."
Ben Wyatt,"I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman."
Ben Wyatt,"Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?"
April Ludgate,What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?
April Ludgate,"We have dogs, cats, rabbits."
April Ludgate,"Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me."
Ron Swanson,The girls want an actual dog.
Ron Swanson,And they want it to look like this.
April Ludgate,Interesting.
April Ludgate,"So, like a banana made of spiders?"
Ron Swanson,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists."
Ron Swanson,And artists are crooks.
April Ludgate,I think I know a good dog.
April Ludgate,There he is!
April Ludgate,"Ron, how about this guy?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, he is a handsome fellow."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, dog."
Ron Swanson,I'll take him.
April Ludgate,That was easy.
April Ludgate,Awesome.
April Ludgate,"Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork."
April Ludgate,Donna?
Ron Swanson,"""Why lie?"""
Ron Swanson,"""I'm shopping."""
Ron Swanson,"""Back in an hour."""
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,"God, she's always just leaving and not telling me."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, caller."
Leslie Knope,You have a comment?
Extra,"Yeah, ever since the merger, we've had a really bad trash problem."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes."
Leslie Knope,And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.
Extra,"No, I mean Eagletonians are human garbage."
Extra,And we should throw them in a dumpster.
Extra,Kapow!
Extra,"Yeah, I really like the merger, but I hate that Eagleton was forced to join Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's what the merger is."
Extra,Oh.
Extra,"Yeah, then I hate the merger."
Andy Dwyer,I think the merger was great.
Andy Dwyer,And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know who this is, but I agree."
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the radio!
Derry Murbles,That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.
Derry Murbles,I'm Derry Murbles.
August Clementine,And I'm August Clementine.
August Clementine,And I talked last.
August Clementine,Good day.
April Ludgate,Is this land mine still functional?
Ron Swanson,Partially.
Ron Swanson,Why?
April Ludgate,Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.
April Ludgate,"I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her."
April Ludgate,What do I do?
Ron Swanson,Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.
Ron Swanson,"Be mature, direct, and firm."
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.
April Ludgate,I took Ron's advice.
April Ludgate,I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.
Donna Meagle,"""Stopped by to adopt a dog, but the employee, Donna Meagle, was nowhere to be found."""
Donna Meagle,"""Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle."""
Donna Meagle,"""Booooo!"""
Donna Meagle,"With five ""O""s."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that sucks."
April Ludgate,"Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?"
Donna Meagle,This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?
Donna Meagle,I'm about to hunt you down.
Tom Haverford,"Don't be upset, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,No one listens to the radio.
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even listening.
Tom Haverford,I was listening to podcasts.
Tom Haverford,Podcasts are great.
Tom Haverford,Radio is boring.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this merger needs a win-- something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so stressed."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?"
Jerry Gergich,Something very special to show you.
Leslie Knope,"Now is not the time, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Please leave.
Jerry Gergich,I think you--
Leslie Knope,Larry!
Leslie Knope,What are you still doing here?
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, this is a picture of us."
Leslie Knope,This is a picture of an elderly couple.
Leslie Knope,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.
Leslie Knope,They've been married for 50 years.
Leslie Knope,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is perfect."
Leslie Knope,A Pawnee Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee Eagleton unity.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.
Ben Wyatt,Stop where you are and take off your clothes.
Ben Wyatt,It's couples massage.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out."
Jerry Gergich,"And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come."
Jerry Gergich,And since you had said do not tell her the secret under any circumstances--
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,Should I text her and try again?
Jerry Gergich,"Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I have been kind of tense lately.
Ben Wyatt,Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.
Ben Wyatt,I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.
Extra,Just you?
Extra,You paid for a couple.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?"
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.
Tom Haverford,Are we sure we should do this?
Tom Haverford,"Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack."
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,He farted so much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and mergery."
Rosie DeMarco,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day."
Doug DeMarco,All right.
Doug DeMarco,How much money did we win?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money."
Leslie Knope,A golden anniversary celebration.
Rosie DeMarco,So no money.
Leslie Knope,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check is."
Tom Haverford,Told you.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you did, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Now is not the time.
Leslie Knope,We-- Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,We'll give you some money.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Here, here's some money."
Leslie Knope,Everybody give 'em money.
Andy Dwyer,"I got football cards, and a travel mouthwash."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Let's get started!
Donna Meagle,Just give me the IP address of the dude that gave me that cracked-out Yelp review.
Extra,"Okay, here we go."
Extra,The IP address says it came from someone inside city hall.
Donna Meagle,In this building?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
April Ludgate,"Well, who cares, really?"
April Ludgate,It's just some dumb internet person.
April Ludgate,Ignore it.
Donna Meagle,Ignore it?
Donna Meagle,I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
Donna Meagle,I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!
Ron Swanson,Speaking of bad reviewsâ¦
Ron Swanson,"Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people and places."
Ron Swanson,"I am composing strongly worded letters about things I disapprove of, and I am using the internet to get addresses where I can send them."
Ron Swanson,"So far I've written to a vegetable farm, several European ambassadors, a manufacturer of male cologne, and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar."
Ron Swanson,"""Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts."""
Ron Swanson,"""Be ice cream or be nothing."""
Ron Swanson,"""Zero stars."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie to see this surprise."
Ben Wyatt,I am so prepared.
Ben Wyatt,I watched Enchanted three times to get all the details right.
Ben Wyatt,"And then another two times, because that movie is amazing."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it really is."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You want to go grab lunch together?
Ben Wyatt,I'm out front.
Ben Wyatt,Super casual.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,I'm not even in my office.
Leslie Knope,I'm out saving the merger.
Leslie Knope,Can it wait?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at dinner.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not too late to cancel the waffle buffet or the Hilary impersonator, but a lot of these deposits were non-refundable."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,You up for a boys' day out in a horsedrawn carriage?
Jerry Gergich,Sure.
Jerry Gergich,What the heck?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thus begins our enchanted adventure."
Ben Wyatt,"God, that movie really was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,And you know what doesn't get enough credit in that movie?
Ben Wyatt,The score.
Jerry Gergich,Music.
Ben Wyatt,"Good sir, tally ho."
Jerry Gergich,"God, that-- from the movie!"
Ben Wyatt,That is definitely from the movie.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you two, head on up there."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.
Doug DeMarco,"Okay, let's relive that day."
Doug DeMarco,Only this time could we shave her moustache?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.
Leslie Knope,They're sort of grumpy.
Tom Haverford,Why are we wasting our time with these old people anyway?
Tom Haverford,They're like the old version of iTunes.
Tom Haverford,"We're like the new version of iTunes, baby."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna be here forever.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna die someday.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other."
Rosie DeMarco,"Hey, no touching."
Rosie DeMarco,This is not your birthday.
Jerry Gergich,"Now, you see, the trick with paella is to use just enough saffron to complement the shellfish."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that is so good."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, isn't this exciting?"
Leslie Knope,"In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television."
Doug DeMarco,Could I have a glass of water before we go on?
Rosie DeMarco,Don't give him any water.
Rosie DeMarco,"He does this annoying thing where every time he takes a drink of water he goes, ""Ah"""
Doug DeMarco,She does this annoying thing where every time she takes a drink of water she is an old nag.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team."
Leslie Knope,"That's what this is, right?"
Joan Callamezzo,"All right, let's burn this candle."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, if we could just have a moment."
Leslie Knope,We need to get ready.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,We gotta go.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, the uppers are kicking in."
Joan Callamezzo,"Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot."
Joan Callamezzo,"Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll."
Rosie DeMarco,"Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?"
Rosie DeMarco,You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I'm going to admit something.
Leslie Knope,"I orchestrated the Pawnee Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible."
Leslie Knope,"So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past 50 years together and focus on the good times, okay?"
Kyle,"Donna, you wanted to see me?"
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I did, troll."
Kyle,What?
Donna Meagle,"You tried to adopt a cat last week and I turned you down, because I thought it was too sad for you to have six cats."
Donna Meagle,Then you tried to blow up my spot online.
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Kyle,"You're not my boss, I work for the city attorney's office."
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Ron Swanson,How much postage does it take to send a letter to Canada?
April Ludgate,Who's it going to?
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Dear Canada, [bleep] you."""
Joan Callamezzo,"Doug and Rosie DeMarco,"
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Joan Callamezzo,Tell us how you first met.
Rosie DeMarco,"Well, it was 1963, and we met, and it was great."
Leslie Knope,Isn't love grand?
Leslie Knope,"50 years of marriage, helping to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton."
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, my show, my questions."
Joan Callamezzo,So what is the secret sauce that we should all be putting on our marriage burgers?
Doug DeMarco,"Well, we never go to bed angry."
Joan Callamezzo,"Never, ever would have thought of that."
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Rosie DeMarco,Okay.
Rosie DeMarco,I can't do this.
Rosie DeMarco,"Leslie, you can keep your money."
Joan Callamezzo,Money?
Joan Callamezzo,Did you bribe them to be here?
Leslie Knope,"No, I--"
Doug DeMarco,Leslie offered us each 200 bucks to keep this goingâ¦
Joan Callamezzo,Ahh.
Doug DeMarco,But it's impossible.
Rosie DeMarco,You want to know why we got married?
Joan Callamezzo,Bring it.
Rosie DeMarco,"I had no prospects, and Dougie here had an alcohol problem."
Rosie DeMarco,"Plus the Cold War was happening, and frankly, we all thought we were gonna die."
Doug DeMarco,"Well, I figured I could really tick off my parents by shacking up with some Pawnee trash."
Leslie Knope,Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it becauseâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Who likes tap dancing?
Doug DeMarco,I slept with Sharon in 1979.
Rosie DeMarco,I used to get out of the shower in front of your brother on purpose.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie, who cares?"
Andy Dwyer,They're old people.
Andy Dwyer,"They eat, they sleep, they complain, and they watch Family Feud."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, I wanna be an old person."
Leslie Knope,"Gah, I don't know what to do."
Leslie Knope,I wish Ben was here.
Leslie Knope,What is he doing right now?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Jerry Gergich,You did good!
Ben Wyatt,Larry!
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Extra,"Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat, the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive, and I wanted to know why you nailed this letter to my door."
Ron Swanson,"""Veganism is the sad result of a morally corrupt mind."""
Ron Swanson,"""Reconsider your life."""
Ron Swanson,Because I believe it.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Extra,Carnivores.
Extra,You're all the same.
April Ludgate,How did that guy know where to find you?
Ron Swanson,I assume he saw my name and address at the bottom of the letter I nailed to his door.
April Ludgate,You signed your real name?
Ron Swanson,Of course I did.
Ron Swanson,What's gonna happen?
Ron Swanson,A vegan is gonna physically attack me?
Ron Swanson,They're basically made of glass.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it."
Ron Swanson,Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.
April Ludgate,"Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?"
April Ludgate,I did.
Donna Meagle,I know.
April Ludgate,You do?
Donna Meagle,I checked what else that user had written.
Donna Meagle,"It was a review of a funeral home that said ""Great first date spot."""
Donna Meagle,I dragged Kyle in here to see if you would come clean.
April Ludgate,"Well, you overestimated how much I care what happens to Kyle."
April Ludgate,"Or anyone, really."
April Ludgate,But I'm sorry that I didn't just talk to you.
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I bailed on work.
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I toyed with you instead of coming at you straight.
Donna Meagle,"From now on, we say what we feel."
Donna Meagle,Cool?
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Your lipstick looks weird.
Donna Meagle,You're gonna want to shut your mouth right now.
April Ludgate,Good talk.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least our merger is going well."
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Andy and Tom were right when they said the DeMarcos don't matter."
Ben Wyatt,Their generation's the past.
Ben Wyatt,The way to make this merger take hold is to focus on the future.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,The children.
Leslie Knope,The children are our future.
Leslie Knope,"Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need your help on something.
Leslie Knope,I think we should go to work
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,But not now.
Leslie Knope,We're having dinner.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, this paella is good."
Leslie Knope,Did you put saffron in here? It makes the shellfish taste delicious.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it does."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee Eagleton Youth Committee."
Leslie Knope,"Now, April says that young people think the word ""committee"" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout."
Tom Haverford,Worse.
Tom Haverford,That's worse.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, new people."
Ben Wyatt,Let's introduce ourselves.
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig Middlebrooks.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Samantha in the boardroom, Miranda in the bedroom."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I know it's not ideal, but it's who I am."
Craig Middlebrooks,This is my friend Madison.
Craig Middlebrooks,She's amazing.
Craig Middlebrooks,And she drove me here!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This group has an incredibly important job.
Ben Wyatt,You need to figure out how to hold this town together.
Leslie Knope,"You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick."
Leslie Knope,So we are gonna order you some 'zzas.
Leslie Knope,"You get to B.S.-ing, brainstorming."
Ben Wyatt,Just chill.
Ben Wyatt,Peace out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so it's been an hour."
Leslie Knope,"From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other."
Leslie Knope,So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford,We have an idea.
Tom Haverford,It's called the Unity Concert.
Tom Haverford,It's a massive music and arts festival to celebrate the merger.
Andy Dwyer,We get artists and musicians from both towns to come together.
Andy Dwyer,"It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock, except for instead of everybody rolling around in mud, they'll be rolling around in happiness."
Andy Dwyer,Or maybe mud.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I can't control the weather.
Madison,We want to have a bunch of different band stages.
Madison,"You know, people will go to parts of the town they don't usually go to."
Madison,"Plus, we'll have tents for art exhibits and panels, and maybe a short film festival."
Tom Haverford,Donna said she might be able to get Ginuwine.
Tom Haverford,That's given me a reason to live.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not like everyone's gonna suddenly start holding hands and making out, but we figure, why not throw a big three-day outdoor party, show everyone a good time, and maybe they'll forget about this stupid stuff."
Tom Haverford,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,I don't-- I don't-- I don't even-- You know what I mean?
Madison,What's wrong with her? Why is making those noises?
April Ludgate,"Oh, right, you don't know Leslie."
April Ludgate,That means she loves it so much she can't speak.
Leslie Knope,"You guys, that's like-- I don't know-- Amazing."
Leslie Knope,Like-- what you do there.
Ben Wyatt,Happy anniversary.
Ben Wyatt,So I know we agreed on no gifts.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,But I did get you a gift.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,"A bunch of them, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"I was gonna surprise you with them yesterday, but they never reached you."
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my eff-ing God."
Leslie Knope,You planned all of this for me? An enchanted carriage? This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I can't believe I actually defeated Leslie Knope at a gift exchange."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,About that.
Leslie Knope,Happy anniversary.
Ben Wyatt,It's the Iron Throne.
Ben Wyatt,Ohh!
Ben Wyatt,It's the Iron Throne.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I had a guy at the model store make a replica.
Leslie Knope,He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know I'm making that dumb surprise face, but I can't help it."
Ben Wyatt,"This is the greatest gift I've ever received, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt,"Come hither, peasant."
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt,Who are you?
Leslie Knope,Our starship is in trouble.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, listen."
Ben Wyatt,If you're not-- if you don't know what you're talking about
