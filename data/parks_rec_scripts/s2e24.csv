Andy Dwyer,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,It's quiet in here.
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
Ron Swanson,The government is shut down.
Ron Swanson,It's in every newspaper.
Andy Dwyer,How long is it going to last?
Ron Swanson,"Well, if we're lucky, this building will be empty for months."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,That is really bad timing.
Andy Dwyer,I just got this super sweet-ass rad crotch rocket.
Andy Dwyer,I've always wanted one of these.
Andy Dwyer,"But due to, you know, never having a job, I couldn't afford it until now."
Andy Dwyer,Got a really good deal on my lease.
Andy Dwyer,Paying 12% interest.
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, one of the highest you can get."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of April."
Andy Dwyer,"If you see her, will you tell her I really need to talk to her?"
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh!
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.
Leslie Knope,"Look, no one is more upset about this than I am."
Leslie Knope,Not like it's a competition or anything.
Leslie Knope,"Because if it was, I would win."
Leslie Knope,But that's neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,The point is I would win.
Extra,How long will they be closed?
Ron Swanson,Could be forever.
Extra,"With the government shut down, who is going to stop Al Qaeda?"
Leslie Knope,One thing at a time.
Extra,School is out in two weeks.
Extra,What am I going to do with my kids all day?
Extra,Keep them in my house?
Extra,Where I live?
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to tell you.
Extra,What about the kids' concert tomorrow at Ramsett Park?
Extra,The Freddy Spaghetti concert.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you're happy."
Ron Swanson,I am. I am extremely happy because I don't think we should be wasting taxpayer money.
Leslie Knope,It's not a waste to provide fun for kids.
Leslie Knope,And I for one do not like having Freddy Spaghetti's blood on my hands.
Ron Swanson,I believe you mean Freddy Spaghetti's sauce.
Ron Swanson,I burned my tongue. Don't even care.
Chris Traeger,You see this color? I don't like it. It's too depressing.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope. One second. I'd like some water.
Chris Traeger,"I'd like it to be cold, I'd like it without ice, I'd like it in a glass or a mug with no handle."
Chris Traeger,How can I help you?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I believe there has been a casualty of war in this government shutdown, and it saddens me."
Leslie Knope,And it is Pawnee's children.
Chris Traeger,"Well, sit down and tell me exactly what has happened."
Leslie Knope,"Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series."
Leslie Knope,"And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown."
Chris Traeger,"It's terrible, and we need to fix it."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument."
Leslie Knope,Is there any way I can still kind of... Yeah?
Chris Traeger,I'd love to hear it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're wrong.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,What a surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"The government has been shut for two days, and one city employee has tried to schedule 14 meetings with me."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guess who?
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Chris Traeger,There was a big concert.
Chris Traeger,"Now, there's not."
Chris Traeger,Isn't there anything that we can do about that?
Ben Wyatt,"No, there isn't."
Chris Traeger,That's too bad.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,I have to go run 10 miles.
Chris Traeger,I have run 10 miles a day every day for 18 years.
Chris Traeger,"That's 65,000 miles."
Chris Traeger,A third of the way to the moon.
Chris Traeger,My goal is to run to the moon.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's talk solutions."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Pawnee is broke."
Ben Wyatt,There's no money for a concert.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park."
Leslie Knope,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is better than Idaho.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Pawnee is not special."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Your department, all the way down here, is not a priority."
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, you're not even supposed to be in the building, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You're non-essential.
Leslie Knope,That is not your call.
Ben Wyatt,"I know, it's on your badge."
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,This isn't me.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris something.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,"I was just doing my daily lunch time 10 miles and I ran by the hospital, and I thought I'd pop up and say hi."
Ann Perkins,Did you just start your run?
Chris Traeger,"No, I'm already at mile nine."
Ann Perkins,But you're not sweating at all.
Chris Traeger,I know.
Chris Traeger,I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute.
Chris Traeger,The scientist who studied me said that my heart could pump jet fuel up into an airplane.
Chris Traeger,I'd love to go out on a date with you.
Chris Traeger,I think you might find me attractive because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met.
Chris Traeger,"And no pressure, but I do have tonight open."
Ann Perkins,I am so sorry.
Ann Perkins,I'm really busy right now.
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,I will try again soon.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Extra,"That's the guy who likes you, that you're not into."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Extra,And which part of him are you not looking at?
Ann Perkins,"Traditionally, when I end a long-term relationship, I'm a little fragile, and I have a tendency to do some reckless things."
Ann Perkins,So I need to stay away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this government shutdown.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this budget crisis.
Leslie Knope,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,You know everything.
Leslie Knope,What should I do about this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"And so now, I work for Norton Construction."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I know I shouldn't have done that.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,How could you quit?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years."
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanaquitz.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I felt like I needed a sign.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a [bleep] on me."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I was indoors.
Mark Brendanawicz,Soâ¦
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, sorry."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,Is this a bad time?
Tom Haverford,Lucy is here.
Tom Haverford,I'm in my sexy pajamas.
Tom Haverford,I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is a bad time."
Leslie Knope,You're about to have sex.
Tom Haverford,Why else would Boyz II Men's On Bended Knee be playing right now?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long."
Leslie Knope,Ladies don't like that.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Just one more thing.
Leslie Knope,Are you using protection?
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Less man time, more Ann time."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Everyone needs a friend they can call and wake up in the middle of the night. Leslie's usually already up.
Ann Perkins,"And often, she's already on her way over."
Leslie Knope,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.
Leslie Knope,You know what is?
Leslie Knope,Sewage.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what are you going to do?"
Leslie Knope,That's the way it is.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ann Perkins,"If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you devious bastard."
Freddy Spaghetti,"Well, the cow goes ""moo"" and the pig goes ""oink"""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan."
Leslie Knope,And I sent up the Bat Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.
Leslie Knope,I told them to be here by 8:00.
Ann Perkins,Do you think anybody is going to show up?
Leslie Knope,"A, yes."
Leslie Knope,"B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves."
Leslie Knope,"But C, yes."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, they're definitely going to show up."
Leslie Knope,"Although, D, maybe not."
Ann Perkins,I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one--
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!"
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I never thought I'd hear those words from you.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,April is here.
Leslie Knope,"Move, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I didn't think you were going to help.
April Ludgate,I still might not.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?"
Jerry Gergich,My doctor just said I should avoid--
Leslie Knope,Being a wuss?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck."
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Can you make us some more pancakes?
April Ludgate,"Yes, Ann, I want pancakes."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%."
Ron Swanson,Let's make it an even 40.
Ben Wyatt,That's not necessary.
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Florence,"Ron, a lot of people are going to get fired. Do you mind trying not to gloat?"
Florence,"Yes, I do, Florence. I do mind that."
Ron Swanson,I'm very excited about this. I made pennants.
Ron Swanson,I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.
Ron Swanson,Just saying that gave me a semi.
Ron Swanson,"Right off the bat, we sell City Hall."
Ron Swanson,Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.J. Maxx.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, that is a very creative idea."
Chris Traeger,"But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams."
Ron Swanson,I hear that.
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,I have tons more ideas.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, uh--"
Ron Swanson,So sorry.
Ron Swanson,New ring tone.
Ron Swanson,Don't cut anything without me.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you hate what we do.
Leslie Knope,I love it enough for both of us.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48."
Ron Swanson,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,Watch me.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to do this, Ron."
Leslie Knope,With or without you.
Leslie Knope,Hammering away.
Leslie Knope,Crank it.
Leslie Knope,Hit it.
Leslie Knope,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?"
Leslie Knope,We need to give him the star treatment.
Donna Meagle,He'd better be showered.
Donna Meagle,"I just detailed my car, and he is notoriously funky."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Sorry we're late.
Tom Haverford,I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.
Lucy,Hi.
Lucy,I'm Lucy.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Lucy,Hey.
Tom Haverford,We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.
Tom Haverford,What were we doing in between?
Tom Haverford,Sex stuff.
Lucy,"You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?"
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"We're so glad you're here, thanks for coming."
Lucy,"Thanks, it's gonna be fun."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna put on a show today.
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna make all the problems in our town go away.
Leslie Knope,But it is gonna make a lot of people happy.
Leslie Knope,Everybody ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
All,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"All right, so-- Oh I forgot."
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a chance to get porta-potties so the audience are gonna have to use Ann's house for the bathrooms.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, aren't we expecting like 300 people?"
Leslie Knope,"Hopefully! Okay, back to work!"
Andy Dwyer,"The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud."
Andy Dwyer,You know what I mean?
Andy Dwyer,"I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything."
Andy Dwyer,Am I talking loud right now?
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,And you know how to ride a motorcycle?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's just like driving half a car."
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,I called you a gajillion times.
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you call me back?
April Ludgate,I'm so sorry.
April Ludgate,I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
April Ludgate,"Jerry, what are you doing?"
Jerry Gergich,Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,You want some help with that?
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard about you and Chris."
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's gonna happen there.
Tom Haverford,Why not? You're a free agent.
Tom Haverford,Unlike me.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I make some bad decisions sometimes at the end of long relationships."
Ann Perkins,I think I'm just gonna cool it for a while.
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to jump into anything.
Tom Haverford,A girl like you can have whatever guy she wants.
Ann Perkins,Shut up.
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious Ann. I might joke about how nice your booty is, but I think you're a really nice person, and I think any guy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,Listen to you. I like Tom with a girlfriend.
Ann Perkins,He's really sweet.
Tom Haverford,How much do you like him? Because I could definitely talk to Lucy about a three way situation.
Ann Perkins,Unbelievable.
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,But serious at the same time.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec."
Ben Wyatt,This one is a little complicated.
Chris Traeger,I know what will loosen up our brains.
Chris Traeger,Massage train.
Chris Traeger,And I know what you're thinking.
Chris Traeger,It's not that I want a massage.
Chris Traeger,I'll be the caboose.
Chris Traeger,And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.
Ben Wyatt,"And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly."
Ben Wyatt,"So, seems like the best option is job cuts."
Ben Wyatt,Starting with Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,"If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me."
Ben Wyatt,But we've run out of options.
Ron Swanson,There are plenty of other options.
Ron Swanson,"For example, sell the zoo animals."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,To whom?
Ron Swanson,Cosmetics labs?
Ron Swanson,Weird restaurants?
Ron Swanson,I'm just spitballing here.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's switch it up."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she makes the second highest salary in the department."
Ben Wyatt,It will go a long way.
Ron Swanson,I'm telling you.
Ron Swanson,It's just not an option.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, focus up, buddy."
Ron Swanson,Just give me a sec.
Andy Dwyer,Will you just stop and listen to me?
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't want to talk to you, anyways."
Andy Dwyer,Reverse psychiatry.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,I like you.
Andy Dwyer,"In a, you know, romantical kind of way."
April Ludgate,You do?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Do you like me?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I don't think we should see each other.
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Because you're 21 and I'm 29?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I don't care about that.
April Ludgate,"It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't.
Andy Dwyer,"Really, I don't."
April Ludgate,"Well, I think you do."
April Ludgate,So... That's a problem for me.
Ron Swanson,"Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work."
Ron Swanson,So you should lay me off.
Ron Swanson,I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.
Ben Wyatt,It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.
Ben Wyatt,You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.
Ron Swanson,I strenuously object.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron, we're moving on."
Ben Wyatt,Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,"No, Ben, they are not."
Ron Swanson,No other department has one to begin with.
Ron Swanson,"Right now, she's singlehandedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids."
Ben Wyatt,She's doing what?
Chris Traeger,Could someone else massage my shoulders?
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Looking good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?"
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ann Perkins,Like a rock arena kind of thing?
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ron Swanson,They're coming.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Andy Dwyer,The Russians?
Ron Swanson,"No, the state auditors."
Ron Swanson,I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.
Ron Swanson,It's been a very strange day for me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, be cool."
Leslie Knope,Just be cool.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Everyone.
Chris Traeger,You are all super amazing.
Chris Traeger,"You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!"
Chris Traeger,"Now, my partner Ben wants to say something."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we're shutting this down."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,That's terrible news!
Chris Traeger,"Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Chris Traeger,Ben says no.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, everyone."
Ben Wyatt,Chris and I used to slash budgets individually.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, when he would do it by himself, nothing got done, and when I did it by myself, I'd get death threats."
Ben Wyatt,"Together, it seems to work."
Ben Wyatt,"The concert is canceled, everybody."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, though, Ben."
Leslie Knope,It's not canceled.
Leslie Knope,We're putting it on.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Because the stage is already built.
Leslie Knope,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.
Leslie Knope,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Leslie, I just found out."
Donna Meagle,Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.
Leslie Knope,But something much cooler is going to happen.
Leslie Knope,I think.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Good job.
Chris Traeger,You should hydrate.
Donna Meagle,"When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton."
Donna Meagle,At a library.
Tom Haverford,That's literally the worst place I can imagine.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Guys?
Leslie Knope,We're not giving up on this.
Leslie Knope,He's not the only musician in town.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I don't really feel like playing right now.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, please."
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Andy Dwyer,I don't even have children's songs.
Andy Dwyer,My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle."""
Andy Dwyer,Pickle?
Andy Dwyer,"You got pickle hair, baby, And you got it from me"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Still sounds like it's about sex.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,I've got to grab my guitar from my house.
Andy Dwyer,I'll be back shortly!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"See, guys?"
Leslie Knope,We have a solution.
Leslie Knope,"And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just."
Leslie Knope,There's nothing--
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Andy Dwyer,My arm!
Ann Perkins,"You have two broken bones in your right arm, and four in your hand."
Andy Dwyer,That's the side that hurts.
Leslie Knope,How soon until he's better?
Dr. Harris,"We'll set the fractures, and I'd like to keep him overnight for observation."
Andy Dwyer,Is there any chance you can fix me in the next 10 minutes?
Dr. Harris,"Sure, I'll just advance medical science 30 years."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Leslie Knope,Can Mouse Rat play without you?
Andy Dwyer,They tried once.
Andy Dwyer,"They're called Rat Mouse, and they're awful."
Andy Dwyer,But you have got to find somebody.
Andy Dwyer,There's an old saying in show business.
Andy Dwyer,"""The show must go wrong."""
Andy Dwyer,"Everything always goes wrong, and you just have to deal with it."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I'm Renata Ricotta.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.
Leslie Knope,He bumped his noodle.
Leslie Knope,There was sauce everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It was just streaming out of his face.
Leslie Knope,It was really scary.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"If you're happy and you know it, Clap your hands, If you're happy and you know itâ¦"
Freddy Spaghetti,Clap your hands
Freddy Spaghetti,"Hey, kids!"
Freddy Spaghetti,"It's me, Freddy Spaghetti!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton."
Freddy Spaghetti,All I know is this guy showed up and made me a much better offer.
Freddy Spaghetti,"I am all about the money, babe."
Freddy Spaghetti,"She cooked an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot linguine, That she made for the first time that day"
Ron Swanson,Thank you very much.
Tom Haverford,Ron Corleone.
Tom Haverford,"This really attractive woman is my girlfriend, Lucy."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Lucy."
Ron Swanson,Whoa!
Lucy,Hi.
Ron Swanson,Impressive handshake.
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy,My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and Communists.
Lucy,He hated both.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Tommy."
Tom Haverford,Is that bacon on your turkey leg?
Ron Swanson,They call it a Swanson.
Lucy,Wow.
Ron Swanson,Freddy Spaghetti.
Lucy,That guy rules.
Ann Perkins,I brought you your favorite.
Ann Perkins,Every color of Jell-O.
Andy Dwyer,The Jell-O rainbow.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Is something wrong?
Andy Dwyer,"Okh, okay, you know when you're just already having a bad day, and then you break all the bones in your arm because you crash your motorcycle?"
Ann Perkins,"Dude, that's what my whole week has been like."
Ann Perkins,My life is a motorcycle crash right now.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,Injured Andy.
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of like old times, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I almost expect you to call me A-Cakes.
Andy Dwyer,A- Cakes.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're okay."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I'm... I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins,I should not... I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,That was notâ¦
Freddy Spaghetti,Spaghetti.
Kids,Spaghetti.
Freddy Spaghetti,Fusilli.
Kids,Fusilli.
Freddy Spaghetti,Egg noodles.
Kids,Egg noodles.
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm not a monster."
Ben Wyatt,I want the kids to have their concert.
Leslie Knope,Mean Ben has a soft spot.
Ben Wyatt,Is that what you guys call me?
Leslie Knope,"No. No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Mean Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this is really great today, but there's going to be a lot of pain ahead, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,We have to cut 32% of the--
Leslie Knope,"Just... Can you just stop it? Okay? Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut."
Leslie Knope,A service.
Leslie Knope,And they love it.
Freddy Spaghetti,Macaroni.
Kids,Macaroni.
Ben Wyatt,The biggest service was getting you to stop singing.
Freddy Spaghetti,Linguine.
Kids,Linguine.
Freddy Spaghetti,Tetrazzini.
Kids,Tetrazzini.
Lucy,Hey.
Lucy,You wanna go to Ann's house?
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Move!
Lucy,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,April.
April Ludgate,I just heard.
April Ludgate,Are you okay?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
