Ben Wyatt,"Okay, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,"Big, big news."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie, would you like to do the honors?"

Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but you're the candidate."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but you're the brilliant campaign manager."
Ben Wyatt,But you're the cutest.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, were you going to tell us something?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, right."
Ben Wyatt,The latest poll has us only two points behind Bobby Newport!
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Two points!
Leslie Knope,"I know, you guys, we only have one more day to close the gap, and we're going to do so in a onetime campaign blitz aboard the S.S. Knope"
Leslie Knope,This is going to be our home for the next 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,"And if we win, hopefully, it will be the home that Ben and I share forever."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, what?"
Leslie Knope,It's just an idea I had.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to do it.
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,We've come so far.
Leslie Knope,"I want this so bad, I can taste it."
Leslie Knope,"When I close my eyes, I can picture the flash of the cameras at my swearing in."
Leslie Knope,And I can hear the sound of the applause when I take my oath.
Leslie Knope,And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
Leslie Knope,He made it.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't think he would come, but he made it."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,"A few days ago, on a routine campaign stop in downtown Pawnee, one Leslie Knope pause was attacked play by a pie."
Andy Dwyer,"Luckily, it only hit Jerry, so no damage was done."
Andy Dwyer,Play.
Andy Dwyer,"The only evidence we have is a video shot by pause my wife, April Ludgate."
Andy Dwyer,This is Bert Macklin's greatest assignment yet.
Andy Dwyer,"If you are watching, perpetrator, just know that you are still at large."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, listen up, folks."
Andy Dwyer,We have a security situation here.
Andy Dwyer,"As you know, when we reach the location, I will be conducting a security sweep."
Andy Dwyer,"Also, from now on, we'll be using code names."
Andy Dwyer,"You can address me as ""eagle one."""
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, code name: ""Been there, done that."""
Andy Dwyer,"April is ""currently doing that."""
Andy Dwyer,"Donna is ""it happened once in a dream."""
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, code name: ""If I had to pick a dude."""
Andy Dwyer,"Ben is ""eagle two."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God."
Tom Haverford,"No, please."
Tom Haverford,Come we have a problem.
Tom Haverford,"The vans we rented to take senior citizens to the polls tomorrow are now, quote, ""no longer available."""
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"I thought we locked those vans down, like, a week ago."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we worked really hard to get those seniors back on our side after that ramp debacle."
Leslie Knope,I really need their votes.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, go down there and get those vans back."
Tom Haverford,I'll use my legendary Haverford charm.
Leslie Knope,I have total faith in you.
Leslie Knope,Take Donna with you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you go too."
Leslie Knope,"April, you are a very intelligent and savvy young woman."
Leslie Knope,"I do not just think of you as just a gofer, but right now, I need you to get me a triple espresso with eight sugars."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Wha I'm on it.
Chris Traeger,I'll go.
Chris Traeger,I'm going.
April Ludgate,"Please, I can go."
April Ludgate,I don't mind.
April Ludgate,It's better than listening to her stump speech for a millionth time.
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I will do it.
Chris Traeger,I have to do it.
Chris Traeger,I need to do it.
Chris Traeger,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,"This has been a difficult year for me, romantically."
Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, Ann Perkins, Andy's professor lots of disappointment, but if I keep my body moving and my mind occupied at all times, I will avoid falling into a bottomless pit of despair."
Ann Perkins,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next city councilor of the great city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope!"
Andy Dwyer,"This is ""eagle one,"" ""been there, done that"" is leaving the stage."
Andy Dwyer,"""I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it"" is in position."
Leslie Knope,What do we want for our city?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I want.
Leslie Knope,"I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square."
Leslie Knope,And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"In the last few weeks, we've turned this campaign into a well oiled machine."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes and 40 seconds every time.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,There will be a big laugh right now.
Ben Wyatt,"And now, a two second awkward silence after Leslie does her Rodney Dangerfield impression."
Leslie Knope,"I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect."
Leslie Knope,No respect at all.
Ben Wyatt,"She insists on trying it every time, and it never works."
Ben Wyatt,"But the rest of the speech, fantastic."
Leslie Knope,"When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby?"
Leslie Knope,"He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain."
Leslie Knope,You deserve more.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the best part.
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when she says
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can build a better Pawnee."
Music,Get on your feet
Ben Wyatt,"Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon."
Andy Dwyer,I've been staring at this board for days.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so close to putting it together.
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something we missed.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go over this again.
Andy Dwyer,"The video shows that the pie came from a high angle, so it would've hit your face like this."
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,Don't close your eyes.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh No, no."
Andy Dwyer,It was actually from up higher.
Andy Dwyer,Is that about right?
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Clean yourself up.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this again.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Bill!"
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford from the Knope campaign.
Bill,"And you brought the whole posse with you, huh?"
Bill,I'm not changing my mind.
Ron Swanson,"We already paid for those vans, Mr. Butler."
Ron Swanson,$900 for one day.
Bill,"Yeah, it was $900, but now it's $10,000."
Donna Meagle,Excuse me?
Bill,The Newport campaign offered me 10 grand to just rent the vans and park them somewhere.
Bill,"So I'm going to tear up your contract, and I'm going to take the money."
Bill,Anything else?
Bill,No?
Bill,Great.
Donna Meagle,"Well, what now?"
Tom Haverford,He's just playing hardball.
Tom Haverford,Let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
Tom Haverford,"In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then, bam!"
Tom Haverford,I start crying.
Tom Haverford,"We need the vans, so please, give the vans, please?"
Tom Haverford,We need the vans.
Leslie Knope,"And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river."
Extra,"Leslie, can you comment on Bobby's father Nick Newport?"
Leslie Knope,Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong."
Extra,"Sorry, I meant can you comment on Nick Newport dying earlier today?"
Leslie Knope,He died?
Leslie Knope,I Sad.
Extra,Is that your official statement?
Extra,"""I sad""?"
Leslie Knope,"No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer."
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,And and together we can build a better Pawnee.
Music,Get on your feet
Leslie Knope,"No, this is isn't the time."
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Music,Get up and make it happen
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk."
Perd Hapley,"Harsh words, but this reporter does love those tshirt cannons."
Perd Hapley,"Now, Jen, what are your thoughts about all of this?"
Jennifer Barkley,This is not a time for politics.
Jennifer Barkley,I am calling on Leslie Knope to cancel all of her campaign events out of respect for the Newport family.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anything else would be a classless move, on par with spraypainting nipples on the Lincoln memorial."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, emergency meeting."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,A man has died.
Leslie Knope,"But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man."
Leslie Knope,"However, he is a man, and he died."
Ann Perkins,"Also, you called the dead man a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"However, he was a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high."
Ben Wyatt,We can't just stop campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"We stop, we lose."
Leslie Knope,"Good answer, great body."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, try to beat what he said."
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to beat him.
Leslie Knope,Not with that attitude.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,I think you should stop.
Ann Perkins,At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann."
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,If the if the guy if Okay.
Chris Traeger,I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
Chris Traeger,"The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, because if the campaign stops, we all stop."
Chris Traeger,And stopping is certain death.
Chris Traeger,Who wants a panini?
Chris Traeger,Anyone?
Chris Traeger,Everyone?
Chris Traeger,I'm going to say everyone.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ann Perkins,"All right, Leslie, what's your call?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,We're going to keep campaigning.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs."
Leslie Knope,"What's next on the ""schedge?"""
Donna Meagle,"If you let Newport have the vans, they just sit there in a lot."
Donna Meagle,"If you let us have the vans, they drive around town all day."
Donna Meagle,Free publicity.
Donna Meagle,Everyone will see your logo.
Donna Meagle,Which is you all pressed up on some chick with huge cans.
Bill,Yeah.
Bill,It was a hell of a day.
Bill,People need to know about it.
Bill,And I don't need free publicity.
Bill,I can just pay for it.
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player."
Tom Haverford,You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.
Tom Haverford,So how about this?
Tom Haverford,I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.
Tom Haverford,I call it Yogurt platinum.
Tom Haverford,I'll let you in on the ground floor.
Tom Haverford,"And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand."
Bill,"Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself."
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Tom Haverford,"No, you can't do that!"
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment?"
Ron Swanson,"I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man."
Tom Haverford,He's gonna steal yogurt platinum.
Bill,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"""We're all your friends,"" said Mr."
Leslie Knope,bacon.
Leslie Knope,"""Welcome home."
Leslie Knope,""" The end."
Leslie Knope,"And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative."
Leslie Knope,Any questions?
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,How did Groffle cross the syrup river?
Extra,And why did you call Mr.
Extra,Newport a jerk?
Leslie Knope,"Ah well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler."
Extra,Ms.
Extra,"Knope, I have a followup to what I'm now deciding to call ""jerkgate."""
Extra,Are there any other deceased members of Bobby Newport's family you'd like to attack?
Extra,And quit ducking the waffle question.
Extra,Did Groffle use a boat of some kind?
Ben Wyatt,"All right, that's all the questions for now."
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, everybody."
Extra,Are we to assume that he swam across the syrup river?
Extra,Ms.
Extra,Knope!
Leslie Knope,I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
Ann Perkins,It's obvious what you need to do.
Ann Perkins,You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,"We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize"
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time to finish the bus tour."
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a real apology."
Ann Perkins,It's just sneaky.
Ann Perkins,I don't like it.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, for once, this is not about you."
Leslie Knope,A man is dead.
Ron Swanson,"Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract."
Ron Swanson,"Where I come from, a man's word is sacred."
Bill,"Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington?"
Bill,I'm taking the money.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I'll match it.
Ron Swanson,"I'll give you $10,000 for the vans."
Ron Swanson,Deal?
Bill,No.
Bill,Price has gone up.
Bill,"Now it's $12,000."
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,Why?
Bill,"Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them."
Bill,"Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me."
Bill,"And now it's 15,000."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how do we leak this to the press?"
Leslie Knope,"Do we, like, release a statement?"
Leslie Knope,Do we call somebody?
Ann Perkins,"Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap.
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap!
Ben Wyatt,We got to get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Turn around!
Ben Wyatt,Turn around!
Jennifer Barkley,This is a time of solemnity and remembrance.
Jennifer Barkley,"This is not a time for politic Oh, wow."
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is driving her campaign bus through a memorial service.
Ben Wyatt,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, back up!"
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Jennifer Barkley,Just when we thought she couldn't stoop any lower.
Jennifer Barkley,Just oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,Uh Go forward!
Ben Wyatt,Go forward!
Leslie Knope,Go forward!
Jennifer Barkley,I feel like he's dying all over again.
Chris Traeger,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Hi Sorry, are we late?"
Jennifer Barkley,"So I I hate to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I'm going to get paid."
Jennifer Barkley,It was a handshake agreement with Mr.
Jennifer Barkley,Newport.
Jennifer Barkley,It was for a lot of money.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, you can wiretransfer it."
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry for your loss.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you turned this situation into a political sideshow.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press."
Leslie Knope,"No way, that's not us."
Leslie Knope,You don't know us at all.
Ben Wyatt,It's rude to say it.
Leslie Knope,We wouldn't even think it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim."
Leslie Knope,"We brought a ""sorry for your loss"" fruit basket for Bobby."
Leslie Knope,And it is very classy.
Leslie Knope,"No melon, no apples."
Jennifer Barkley,"You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you."
Jennifer Barkley,'Cause I'm smarter and faster.
Jennifer Barkley,That is not a judgment.
Jennifer Barkley,That's just a fact.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,I love polka dots.
Jennifer Barkley,It's so cute.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I should have seen this coming."
Ben Wyatt,And we should not have driven here on a bus with your face on it.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's my fault."
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Jen is right.
Leslie Knope,I'm no better than her.
Ann Perkins,"No, Leslie, yes, you are."
Ann Perkins,All you need to do is stop the machine for a second and go apologize to Bobby.
Ann Perkins,Alone without cameras.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago?"
Ann Perkins,That's not going to work.
Leslie Knope,I had to try.
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,"I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back."
Chris Traeger,What's next?
April Ludgate,"Nothing, Chris."
April Ludgate,Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.
Chris Traeger,I can't.
Chris Traeger,I've had a very tough year.
Chris Traeger,I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.
Chris Traeger,"And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place."
April Ludgate,"Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome."
April Ludgate,"Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet."
April Ludgate,"And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets."
April Ludgate,And you're not alone.
April Ludgate,You've got lots of friends.
April Ludgate,Somewhere.
April Ludgate,I assume.
April Ludgate,You're going to be just fine.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,I'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,I'm not fine.
Chris Traeger,It didn't work.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Bobby."
Bobby Newport,"Oh, hi."
Bobby Newport,Want to play bowling?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you play with the real one?
Bobby Newport,Oh.
Bobby Newport,I like this one better.
Bobby Newport,The little guy looks like me.
Bobby Newport,See?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk."
Bobby Newport,That's okay.
Bobby Newport,"He was, like, a million years old."
Bobby Newport,And he was kind of a jerk.
Bobby Newport,"The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less."
Leslie Knope,"You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid."
Leslie Knope,"So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it."
Leslie Knope,"And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event."
Leslie Knope,And I finished dead last.
Leslie Knope,And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,But she wasn't.
Leslie Knope,"She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me."
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, Leslie."
Bobby Newport,That's a great story.
Bobby Newport,"I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but"
Leslie Knope,"You finished this race, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign is over, and you finished."
Leslie Knope,"Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you."
Bobby Newport,Now I get it.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Bobby Newport,Your mom and my dad are both dicks.
Tom Haverford,"There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000."
Ron Swanson,"Even if we had the dough, that bunco artist would just demand more, trust me."
Tom Haverford,Don't move.
Tom Haverford,Let's just stay here.
Tom Haverford,"For like an hour, and not let him out."
Donna Meagle,This isn't right.
Donna Meagle,Our girl's worked hard.
Donna Meagle,We're so close.
Donna Meagle,I know he didn't just hit my baby!
Bill,"Hey! What the hell, guys? Move!"
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Y'all got your seat belts on? Oh!
Donna Meagle,Did you see that? That son of a bitch just rear-ended me.
Tom Haverford,Am I dead?
Bill,What the hell?
Donna Meagle,"Exactly, Bill."
Donna Meagle,What the hell? You just rear-ended me.
Bill,That is not what happened.
Donna Meagle,But I got witnesses.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"It went down exactly the way my girl said it did, you mean, bald man."
Bill,"Hey, what about you, Mr."
Bill,"""A man's word is sacred""?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, it is, but you're an ass [Bleep]."
Donna Meagle,So we can settle this now.
Donna Meagle,I will accept payment in van rentals.
Bill,Gah!
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's go to the video again."
Andy Dwyer,"Sweet kick, Leslie exits the building, and then you get hit."
Andy Dwyer,What else do we know?
Andy Dwyer,"We know that Leslie was about 15 feet in front of you, so clearly the assailant has terrible aim."
Jerry Gergich,Mm-hmm.
Andy Dwyer,Or Leslie wasn't the target.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, who then?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, that's permanent marker."
Andy Dwyer,"Go find Ben, get a list of everyone he's ever fired."
Andy Dwyer,"Go, go! Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Bobby Newport,A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.
Bobby Newport,"Well, let me tell you a little story."
Bobby Newport,My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.
Bobby Newport,"When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it."
Bobby Newport,"At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters."
Bobby Newport,And I won.
Bobby Newport,It was awesome.
Bobby Newport,"My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me."
Bobby Newport,That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we're dead."
Ben Wyatt,It's over.
Leslie Knope,That's my story.
Bobby Newport,"Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest."
Bobby Newport,Somebody who's been very supportive and mega cool today.
Bobby Newport,Leslie Knope.
Bobby Newport,Will you come up here?
Leslie Knope,What?
Bobby Newport,"Come on, come up here."
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Bobby Newport,"You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great."
Bobby Newport,People should stop being so mean to her.
Bobby Newport,"In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady."
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, we did it!"
Bobby Newport,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Maybe we're not dead.
Jennifer Barkley,"Chris, right? Hi, I'm Jen."
Chris Traeger,Hello.
Jennifer Barkley,"You know, there are 30 bedrooms in this house. Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free."
Jennifer Barkley,What do you say?
Chris Traeger,Oh! That is very flattering.
Chris Traeger,But you're the opposition campaign manager.
Chris Traeger,I couldn't do that to Leslie.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, for God's sake, Chris."
Jennifer Barkley,This campaign is over.
Jennifer Barkley,My job is done and so is yours.
Jennifer Barkley,It's just sex.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm very good at it.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,Great! Let's do it.
Jennifer Barkley,"Haven't got all day, honey."
Andy Dwyer,Sewage Joe.
Andy Dwyer,"Ben Wyatt fired you for sending pictures of your penis to everyone, and you've come here to ""pie"" him."
Joe From Sewage,Little twerp has it coming.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, dude, I dare you."
Andy Dwyer,Please.
Andy Dwyer,Give me one reason to take you down.
Andy Dwyer,"I would love nothing more Oh, [Bleep]."
Andy Dwyer,"Ben, sorry."
Extra,"All right, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I did it!"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Great job.
