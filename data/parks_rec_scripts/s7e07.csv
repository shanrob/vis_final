Joe,"We're going to have orchids on the all the pews, right?"
Joe,"Because orchids are Donna's favorite flowers, and she's my favorite flower."
Donna Meagle,We're real cute.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, of course, there are going to be orchids."
Craig Middlebrooks,You think this is my first time working a side job as a wedding planner for a former coworker?
Joe,No?
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm so sorry.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I mostly have my rage problem under control, but planning is very stressful."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Please, avoid my trigger words, flowers, schedule, vows, bride, groom, food, love, happy, church, event, wedding, and Craig."
Joe,"I'm so sorry, Craig."
Joe,I'm sorry.
Joe,I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,"April, walk with me."
Donna Meagle,So I chose you as my maid of honor because you've become one of my best friends.
Donna Meagle,And I love you like a sister.
April Ludgate,Ew.
Donna Meagle,"But also, because you're tough."
Donna Meagle,My family arrives tonight.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,And they're all set with their welcome bags.
April Ludgate,"And I told your brother, LeVondrious, that he is not welcome."
Donna Meagle,"Good, but still, there's going to be 28 Meagles in one room, which means there's gonna be drama."
April Ludgate,I will handle everything.
April Ludgate,I actually care whether you're having a good time and are happy.
April Ludgate,It's weird.
Donna Meagle,The Meagles are a coldblooded crew of judgmental grudgeholders.
Donna Meagle,"My cousin Winnie once forgot to use a coaster at my grandpa's house, and he wrote her out of his will."
Donna Meagle,The last four Meagle family Pictionary tournaments ended at the hospital.
Donna Meagle,"Legally, no more than three Meagles are allowed on an international flight together."
Donna Meagle,But they give great gifts.
Donna Meagle,Got to get that flatware.
Lucy,"Tommy, I was at the nail salon and I picked up some geranium hand cream."
Lucy,Do you want to try it?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes."
Tom Haverford,"Warm it up, please."
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,That smells nice.
Lucy,"I'm just gonna go and make sure everything is set for tonight, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"All right, see you later."
Lucy,"See you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I've always liked that Lucy.
Ron Swanson,Glad things are going well.
Tom Haverford,Better than well.
Tom Haverford,And guess what I have planned for tonight.
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"As Donna's butler of honor, I'm going all out."
Tom Haverford,Baby blue brocade.
Tom Haverford,"As a surprise, I got a matching dress for Lucy."
Ron Swanson,And you believe Lucy will be happy with this gift?
Tom Haverford,"A hundred percent, we're so in sync."
Tom Haverford,I finally feel like I'm with the person I'm going to be with forever.
Tom Haverford,I'd marry her tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, son."
Ron Swanson,"More importantly, do you have tri-tip for tonight?"
Ron Swanson,"Because if not, I brought my own."
Ron Swanson,I love weddings.
Ron Swanson,"Good food, the celebration of romantic love, and most of all, churches."
Ron Swanson,"Say what you will about organized religion, those bastards knew how to construct an edifice."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, monsters."
Leslie Knope,Mommy and Daddy have to pack because we're going to a hotel.
Leslie Knope,But Roz is going to stay here with you.
Roz,"Yeah, and we are going to have so much fun, we're going to play games, we're going to color, maybe we're going to even sit quietly for 30 seconds."
Roz,Do you think I could have 30 seconds?
Roz,That's all--
Leslie Knope,She's fading.
Leslie Knope,"Roz, Roz."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You are a wonderful nanny.
Roz,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're tough and strong.
Leslie Knope,And you're an excellent caretaker for our children.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, every time you come to our house, we are so happy to see you."
Leslie Knope,I love you more than Ben.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"If Ben left me, I would be sad but I would get through it."
Leslie Knope,But if you left me I would never recover.
Roz,Thanks.
Roz,That helps.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm so used to packing for them, I almost put in diapers for myself."
Extra,"Incoming call, Jen Barkley."
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley is calling again.
Leslie Knope,She's relentless.
Ben Wyatt,Jen is a powerful political operative.
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to know what she has to say?
Leslie Knope,"She'll just say what she always says, which is, ""Leslie, would you consider running for state Senate or Congress?"""
Leslie Knope,"And I'll say, ""Jen, thank you very much, that's very flattering but I love my job and I get to do it for the entire country."""
Leslie Knope,The whole world is my park.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, our lives are so chaotic, we can't run a campaign."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if you really wanted to do it, we'd find a way."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, things aren't that chaotic."
Roz,All three of them just bonked into each other and broke everything you own.
Roz,I don't know what that was.
Gayle Gergich,Oh!
Gayle Gergich,Would you look at that?
Gayle Gergich,"Sweetie, I think your best friend, Tom, is giving his lady friend a gift."
Jerry Gergich,You know Gayle gives me a gift each and every day.
Gayle Gergich,"Oh, I've got the greatest gift of all."
Gayle Gergich,Being married to you.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,Sweetie!
Ron Swanson,"Control yourselves, Gergiches!"
Lucy,"Damn, Tommy, well done!"
Tom Haverford,I knew you'd like it.
Tom Haverford,"Get changed, baby."
Tom Haverford,We've got to dominate this party.
Lucy,"What do you think, Ron?"
Lucy,Tommy's the man.
Ron Swanson,I normally don't get involved in people's personal affairs but something about a wedding... I'll just say it.
Ron Swanson,Tom is quite taken with you.
Lucy,"He's taken with me, huh?"
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,"He said he'd ""marry you tomorrow."""
Ben Wyatt,Seems silly to stay at a hotel that's 10 minutes from our house.
Leslie Knope,"It's been three years, we deserve one night away together."
Leslie Knope,A little down time.
Leslie Knope,A little privacy.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we make some more kids?
Ben Wyatt,Don't even joke about that.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just make, like, three more so that each one of them can have a friend."
Leslie Knope,Jen?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Jennifer Barkley,You idiots won't answer my calls and what I have to tell you cannot wait.
Jennifer Barkley,What's that horrible sound?
Ben Wyatt,Children.
Jennifer Barkley,Ugh!
Jennifer Barkley,Your life is gross.
Jennifer Barkley,My life is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Jen, thank you so much for coming but we have to go."
Leslie Knope,I have never been late for an event that requires an RSVP.
Jennifer Barkley,"You guys live in Pawnee, Indiana."
Jennifer Barkley,Where do you have to go?
Jennifer Barkley,Puttin' up a new scarecrow?
Ben Wyatt,"Could you, please, just get to the point?"
Jennifer Barkley,Sure.
Jennifer Barkley,"Paul Hartwell, who is your congressional incumbent from this district, is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,Even by Washington standards.
Jennifer Barkley,But he wins every year because he's a horrible bully and nobody opposes him.
Jennifer Barkley,Till now.
Extra,Indiana's 10th district needs a new leader.
Extra,Someone who's made it a home.
Extra,"Who cares about our citizens, and who understands the local economy."
Leslie Knope,"Jen, I told you."
Leslie Knope,I have a dream job.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to --
Extra,A candidate named Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry?
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm dead serious, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,I think you should run for the House of Representatives.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,What was that?
Jennifer Barkley,That was huge.
Ben Wyatt,"Hang on, this is Congress you're talking about."
Ben Wyatt,Like where... Like bills become laws.
Ben Wyatt,I am not qualified for that.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're talking about the House of Representatives, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,You might be over qualified.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hartwell's biggest weakness is the economy, which is your exact strength."
Jennifer Barkley,You're young.
Jennifer Barkley,You're smart.
Jennifer Barkley,You're running the biggest city in the district.
Jennifer Barkley,I saw you handle that WiFi thing on TV.
Jennifer Barkley,"My firm is ready to go, as soon as you say the word."
Jennifer Barkley,Are you in or are you out?
Roz,"Uh, two of the three kids are showering in their pajamas, and most of Ben's ties are in the toilet."
Roz,"Just like, as a update of where things are at."
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, this is chaos."
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, it happened a really long time ago, right?"
Andy Dwyer,And it was probably an accident.
Extra,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Dig Dug machine just unplugged itself, right before I was about to beat his high score."
Extra,"Yeah, I'm sure it was an accident."
April Ludgate,"Hey, status report?"
Andy Dwyer,The Meagles are weird.
Andy Dwyer,The words that they say sound passive but seem aggressive.
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like there should be a term for that, like Nicey meany."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just had to physically separate two 80 year old men who were arguing about whether it was really Lena Horne in that grocery store in 1970."
April Ludgate,"Okay, you stay on the Key Largo and Denver Meagles, and I will handle the Berlin Meagles."
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Leslie Knope,"So, you're thinking about Jen's offer?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, how would this even work?"
Ben Wyatt,"Our lives are so busy, and if I won, I would be a Congressman or woman, I mean, equal rights."
Ben Wyatt,"No, that doesn't apply."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Try this.
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, just act like you've decided to run."
Leslie Knope,"And then tomorrow, at the wedding, act like you've decided not to run."
Leslie Knope,See which one feels better.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,And what do you think I should do?
Leslie Knope,Ben has to run.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to push it because it might backfire but he has to run.
Leslie Knope,He would be good for America.
Leslie Knope,Good for the world.
Leslie Knope,Ben should be the Royal Archduke Sultan Emperor of all inhabitable lands on Earth.
Leslie Knope,I'm completely neutral.
Leslie Knope,I will support you no matter what you do.
Tom Haverford,"You told Lucy, I want to marry her?"
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, son, the small hamburgers!"
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,You have to walk back what you said.
Ron Swanson,"""Walk back"" sounds like lying."
Tom Haverford,Can you drop your strict life codes for a second and help me out?
Tom Haverford,"Even though I've known Lucy for years, and can see myself spending a life together with her, having children, walking the grounds of Tommy's Bahama, a private island, I'll eventually buy."
Tom Haverford,"That's way in the future, man."
Ron Swanson,"Don't call me, ""Man."""
Tom Haverford,That's what you took away from this?
Tom Haverford,Uh!
Tom Haverford,Don't serve this man.
Tom Haverford,No more food until he fixes the giant disaster he's created.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Starting now, you're in campaign mode."
Leslie Knope,"So first up, meet and greet."
Leslie Knope,"You remember how this goes, right?"
Leslie Knope,Your goal is to act like everyone is interesting and important.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Too hard.
Leslie Knope,Let's try someone else.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Here's Donna's parents, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Work your magic.
Ben Wyatt,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Meagle, I presume."
Extra,"I am Mr. Meagle, but we're divorced."
Extra,I'm Grace Callahan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm sorry Ms. Callahan."
Extra,It's Doctor Callahan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hope that you are a podiatrist or a dentist because I seem to have a case of foot in mouth disorder."
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,How's everything going?
Joe,"April, we couldn't be happier and you are an angel for asking."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's surprisingly painless."
Donna Meagle,"No swiping, no passive-aggressive comments... No drama at all."
Andy Dwyer,"Here are all the troublemakers, boss."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Meagles, I am not screwing around, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Lauren, no more discussion of Majorca."
April Ludgate,Majorca is off limits.
April Ludgate,"Brian and Gloria, stop making Horatio feel bad that your daughter went to Yale."
April Ludgate,No one gives a [bleep]. And Ginuwine.
Ginuwine,Yes.
April Ludgate,Get it together.
Ginuwine,"I'm sorry, April."
Ginuwine,Kathy started this.
April Ludgate,"""It's Kathy that started"" I don't care!"
Andy Dwyer,She doesn't mean it.
Andy Dwyer,"Don't cry, Ginuwine, it's okay."
Ginuwine,"Thanks, Andy."
April Ludgate,Easy peasy.
April Ludgate,Lemon sneezy.
Ron Swanson,"Lucy, I have something to tell you."
Ron Swanson,I am a liar.
Lucy,What?
Ron Swanson,"Well, no, I am not a liar."
Ron Swanson,I have never lied about anything in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Though, I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie."
Lucy,What is happening right now?
Ron Swanson,Tom wanted to convey that he likes you a great deal.
Ron Swanson,So he said that he could imagine marrying you and living on an island with your kids.
Lucy,"Wait, now we're on an island?"
Lucy,With kids?
Lucy,Plural?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Now, do you know where I can find those little ham balls?"
Ben Wyatt,"Watch out for those riding lawnmowers, man."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, you are killing it."
Ben Wyatt,"I am, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"See, just thinking I'm a Congressman makes me feel like one."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, also, I have a little secret."
Ben Wyatt,I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,I am too.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since we had our kids, it only takes, like, one sip of wine."
Ben Wyatt,I feel so good and condifent.
Ben Wyatt,Con... I feel condifent.
Leslie Knope,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,You should give a toast.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you were running for Congress, you have to give speeches, right?"
Ben Wyatt,You want me to make a toast?
Ben Wyatt,I'll toast it up.
Leslie Knope,"Toast it, baby."
Leslie Knope,Roast it and toast it till it's brown on both sides!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey everybody, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, we, of course, are here to celebrate Donna and Joe."
Ben Wyatt,"And I have to say, you know, getting married is the bravest, most wonderful thing you can do."
Ben Wyatt,"Because every day you come home and you're just like ""What?"""
Ben Wyatt,"""It's you, I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You're my sexy roommate."""
Ben Wyatt,"""We love each other."""
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,He's talkin' about me.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I am, babydoll."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Donna and Joe are great."
Ben Wyatt,You all are great.
Ben Wyatt,And this wedding is gonna to be amazing.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get some music and dancing going.
Ben Wyatt,"And I am Ben Wyatt, and I very much approve this message!"
April Ludgate,You want me to shut that down?
Donna Meagle,"No, I like it."
Donna Meagle,Let the little man dance.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,My head... Last night was so fun but my head... Died.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, mine's filled with concrete."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so... Yesterday, you pretended you were going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Today, you're going to pretend like you're not going to run."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Jen posted the campaign ad, it's everywhere."
Ben Wyatt,I'm running.
Ben Wyatt,"How could she do this to-- Oh, God, I'm remembering things."
Ben Wyatt,"We called Jen last night, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we did."
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,I also called 867-5309 100 times.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Bad.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Jennifer Barkley,There you are.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,You guys should have corner boothed it because you look awful.
Jennifer Barkley,You're gonna scare off the other customers.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Jennifer Barkley,All those kids keep you up all night?
Jennifer Barkley,So happy with my choices.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Jen."
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I know I left you a message last night but I really do think you should have checked with me before throwing me into this.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,Ben.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm sorry, you left me four messages last night."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,And they contain very specific policy positions.
Ben Wyatt,"I want to come out strong on education, then I'll tack hard into fiscal responsibility."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,8675309
Jennifer Barkley,I love that song.
Leslie Knope,"Jenny, I got your number-- Hey, babe, it's ringing!"
Leslie Knope,"Honey, you were a lot more lucid than I was."
Jennifer Barkley,Wait.
Jennifer Barkley,Were you guys drunk?
Jennifer Barkley,That is hilarious.
Leslie Knope,"No, we weren't--"
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you guys are going to fit in so great in Washington."
Jennifer Barkley,Most of Congress is drunk all of the time.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, official presser is tomorrow at 9:00."
Jennifer Barkley,"You could bail if you want, but it would be embarrassing."
Jennifer Barkley,Might derail your career.
Jennifer Barkley,Might not.
Jennifer Barkley,Probably will.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, you never do know, though, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,"So, just let me know what you want to do."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay?
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just going to spend my time doing exactly what I want to do.
Jennifer Barkley,Because I don't have children.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bye, guys."
Extra,"Ron, I'm Walden with the Church's historical archives."
Extra,You called about wanting information on the building?
Ron Swanson,"I did, indeed."
Ron Swanson,Let's start with the facade.
Ron Swanson,Was the limestone locally hand-hewn?
Extra,No.
Extra,"In the late 1870s, it was actually cheaper to import limestone from Michigan."
Ron Swanson,Fascinating.
Ron Swanson,But tell me--
Lucy,I'll do whatever you want.
Lucy,I'm fine with whatever.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Wherever you want.
Tom Haverford,No pressure.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Look at how beautiful you look.
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, I'm not even in my dress yet."
Leslie Knope,But you're going to be very soon.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I want to say something to my girls."
Donna Meagle,"Knope, you're a softie but on the inside you're a straight-up boss."
Donna Meagle,"April, you're the exact opposite."
Donna Meagle,You all inspire me and I love you.
Donna Meagle,"And you too, Michelle."
Donna Meagle,"Michelle, you were my best friend from childhood."
Donna Meagle,Until we lost touch because you thought your college boyfriend was into me.
Donna Meagle,He was.
Donna Meagle,I never gave him the time of day.
Donna Meagle,"But now, we're rebuilding our friendship."
Donna Meagle,Is this wedding going to be a test for you?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,"But the doctors once told you, you were never going to walk again, so... This should be easy, right?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a complicated tapestry that is.
Donna Meagle,"Bring it in, bring it in."
Craig Middlebrooks,Moment over.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Leslie, April, help Donna with her dress."
Typhoon,"Hi, I'm Typhoon."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Typhoon, I am interested, but now is not the time."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Michelle, get the bouquet."
Craig Middlebrooks,You're skating on very thin ice.
Ron Swanson,I couldn't help but notice from afar that you are both acting like weirdoes.
Ron Swanson,I further suspect you have not yet talked about what happened.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"I don't even know what you're talking about, us having not talked about."
Ron Swanson,I only meant to say that there's no shame in declaring how you feel to a person you cherish.
Ron Swanson,I am sorry if I caused a problem because the two of you make a good team.
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, I missed out on the food, and was denied a fascinating conversation about Michigan limestone."
Ron Swanson,But I'll be damned if I don't properly honor the expression of romantic love.
Tom Haverford,Ron does this weird thing where he says exactly what he means.
Tom Haverford,You just have to ignore him.
Lucy,So you didn't mean what you said?
Tom Haverford,"Look, I'm all in."
Tom Haverford,That's all I meant.
Tom Haverford,"I didn't want you to think I was crazy or jumping the gun, and I know you just got out of a relationship so I don't expect you to feel the same way, butâ¦"
Tom Haverford,That's how I feel.
Lucy,"Well, I'm only dating you for the free dresses, soâ¦"
Tom Haverford,I'm fine with that.
Joe,Donna.
Joe,"Even though I've known you for years, I feel like I learn something new about you every day."
Joe,"Just yesterday I learned that the Pearl Jam album, Vitalogy was written about you."
Joe,"You are an amazing, confident woman."
Joe,And I love you.
Donna Meagle,I know that I can be a lot.
Donna Meagle,And awhile back I was thinking I'd never find someone who loved me for me.
Donna Meagle,"But you're patient and kind and together, we can do anything."
Extra,You may now kiss the bride.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Roz."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have the zebras."
Leslie Knope,"Tell the kids not to worry, they're coming back home."
Leslie Knope,"Also, we want to give you a raise."
Leslie Knope,And anything you want to take from our house.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Ben Wyatt,How in the world am I supposed to run for office? Our lives are like one big unexpected stuffed zebra emergency.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, what do you think I should do?"
Leslie Knope,"I told you, I'm neutral."
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, you have never been neutral on anything in your life."
Ben Wyatt,You have an opinion on pockets.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I think they should all be bigger."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I think you should run.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, our lives are bonkers but if something is worth it, and I think this is, then you just make it work."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I just read an article on two minute micro-naps and the science on them is very promising."
Reporter,Ben Wyatt.
Reporter,Any comment on the report that you're running for Congress?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now."
Reporter,Your only experience in politics was as a failed mayor at age 18.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, please, everyone."
Ben Wyatt,We're at a wedding.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm holding zebras.
Reporter,I mean what qualifies you to take over Hartwell's seat?
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, listen to me, please."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm dealing with an actual problem right now, okay? Which, by the way, is what I do for a living."
Ben Wyatt,I solve problems.
Ben Wyatt,"As a budget specialist, and for five years as a City Manager and I'm pretty good at it."
Ben Wyatt,"I have worked hard to transform this area into a fiscally sound destination for people who want good jobs and a good public education, and I think the results speak for themselves."
Ben Wyatt,My name is Ben Wyatt and I'm running for Congress.
Leslie Knope,"My God, babe, that was so hot."
April Ludgate,Donna.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,How did I do?
Donna Meagle,Everything was perfect.
Donna Meagle,You are a miracle worker.
Donna Meagle,"But I gotta say, I kind of miss the Meagle drama."
Donna Meagle,I thought for sure somebody was going to do something crazy.
Donna Meagle,But everybody is just nice and chill.
Donna Meagle,"Anyway, I love you, and to thank you, I'm going to try not to hug you."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,I'm going to hug you.
April Ludgate,No!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, all right."
Donna Meagle,"Wyatt, why didn't you tell us you were running for Congress?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we didn't want to steal your thunder."
Donna Meagle,Steal my thunder? I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,Have you seen how I'm wearing this dress?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, in that case, yes, I am."
Joe,To Ben.
Ben Wyatt,To Donna and Joe.
Tom Haverford,To me.
Tom Haverford,I own my own restaurant and several other properties.
Tom Haverford,It's always worth celebrating.
April Ludgate,Who's Gary?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I think that's supposed to be me."
April Ludgate,"That's your new name, Garry."
Andy Dwyer,Garry.
All,Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry!
Jerry Gergich,Garry is my real name.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, after 30 years, my co-workers are finally going to call me by my real name."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy, I'm blessed."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Everyone, can I have your attention, please?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Now, it's time for a surprise musical guest."
Craig Middlebrooks,"One of my all-time favorites, me."
Craig Middlebrooks,I had a girl Donna was her name
Andy Dwyer,Donna!
Andy Dwyer,Joe!
Andy Dwyer,"I hope you saved a slice of that cake for your estranged brother, LeVondrious."
LeVondrious,"What's up, girl? Didn't expect to see your baby bro at your wedding, huh? Well, I'm here."
LeVondrious,Despite what you did to me all those years ago.
Donna Meagle,What I did? This is because of what you did.
LeVondrious,"Oh, you must be referring to the microwave incident."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
LeVondrious,Don't worry.
LeVondrious,I brought it back.
LeVondrious,Now no one gets any popcorn.
April Ludgate,You said you wanted a little drama.
Donna Meagle,"That's why I love you, girl."
