Character,Line
Leslie Knope,This is a historic day.
Leslie Knope,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic."
Chris Traeger,"Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing."
Extra,"It is horse dancing, madam."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take it easy, Alonzo."
Leslie Knope,"All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will."
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, welcome to your new departments."
April Ludgate,Attention: Eagleton is now under martial law.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you'll be with Craig."
Leslie Knope,"April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer."
Leslie Knope,"And Ron, your guy is also named Ron."
Tom Haverford,Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.
Tom Haverford,"Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say ""Tommy's Tootsies"" across the toes."
Leslie Knope,"You do have a counterpart, actually."
Leslie Knope,"His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I also have a little surprise."
Leslie Knope,I would like to introduce our new filing temp.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, everybody."
April Ludgate,No!
Tom Haverford,"No, why?"
Tom Haverford,This can't be happening.
Ron Swanson,"Why, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergich."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name."
April Ludgate,Larry?
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's not Larry."
Jerry Gergich,It's Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's Gary."
April Ludgate,"Your name is Larry, Larry Gengurch."
April Ludgate,His name is Larry Gengurch.
Jerry Gergich,"Come on, April, it's already hard enough for my family when you call me ""Gary."""
Jerry Gergich,Jerry.
April Ludgate,"Ha, ha, classic Larry."
Tom Haverford,Larry.
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Ron Swanson,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Donna Meagle,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure who we should keep.
Leslie Knope,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived."
Leslie Knope,Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.
Leslie Knope,But the Eagletonians are probably good too.
Chris Traeger,"Today, we are not just merging two towns."
Chris Traeger,We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.
Chris Traeger,"Happy birthday, New Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Party's over.
Ben Wyatt,"You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made."
Extra,You're not as nice as the other guy.
Ben Wyatt,I don't care.
Chris Traeger,"When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy."
Ben Wyatt,And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.
Chris Traeger,Like a majestic alleyoop.
Chris Traeger,You're all amazing!
Ben Wyatt,You're all fired.
Chris Traeger,Teamwork.
Jerry Gergich,"Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Larry Gengurch."
Jerry Gergich,Please leave your message after the tone.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, when Leslie called to see if I could help, Gayle and I were just getting on a cruise ship to the Bahamas."
Jerry Gergich,"I said, ""Gayle, put that bikini away, because Pawnee needs me."""
Jerry Gergich,Oh ho!
Jerry Gergich,Somebody forgot a banana in here ooh!
Donna Meagle,"Hi, I'm Donna."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, that is the perfect name for you."
Craig Middlebrooks,I love it.
Craig Middlebrooks,Never change it!
Donna Meagle,Wasn't gonna.
Donna Meagle,"You're Craig, right?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ugh, yes, but I hate that name."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's so boring.
Craig Middlebrooks,Sounds like someone's cousin.
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig!
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig!
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want to be a Spanish man named Terrence, but that didn't happen."
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,So here's my list of duties.
Donna Meagle,I'm basically the office manager.
Donna Meagle,How about you?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, I did everything."
Craig Middlebrooks,Everything!
Craig Middlebrooks,"I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it."
Craig Middlebrooks,You don't even know!
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?"
Tynnyfer,"No, it's Tynnyfer with two y's."
Tynnyfer,"I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself."
Tynnyfer,"Oh, wait, hang on."
Tynnyfer,It's Xanax o'clock.
April Ludgate,"Um, well, nice to meet you."
April Ludgate,"My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks."
Tynnyfer,"I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, ""Shut up."""
Tynnyfer,Where do I get that?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Who's your spinning instructor?
April Ludgate,Gregory or Wynona?
Tynnyfer,I go to Yonis.
Tynnyfer,Who are Gregory and Wynona?
Tynnyfer,I've never heard of them before.
Tynnyfer,Are they better?
April Ludgate,Wynona rocks my world.
Tynnyfer,"Seriously, you need to get me in there."
Tynnyfer,"Like, that's a must, must, must."
April Ludgate,She's the worst person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,I want to travel the world with her.
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Dunn,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Last name?
Ron Dunn,Dunn.
Ron Swanson,"Is that your name, or are you telling me you're finished talking?"
Run Dunn,Both.
Ron Swanson,Dunn and done.
Ron Swanson,I like Ron.
Ragiv,Hi.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,You must be Eric.
Ragiv,I'm Ragiv from I.T.
Ragiv,This is ERIC.
Tom Haverford,ERIC is a computer program?
Ragiv,Stands for Eagleton Reservation Information Center.
Ragiv,It does all the scheduling in Eagleton.
Ragiv,I'm here to install it.
Tom Haverford,But scheduling's the main part of my job.
Ragiv,You still have a human being in charge of booking tennis courts?
Ragiv,"What is this, 1990?"
Ragiv,I guess that explains the shoulder pads.
Tom Haverford,How did he notice these?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this is a surprise."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec."
Ann Perkins,"You know, just so you could hear some things from me."
Ann Perkins,Verbal things from my mouth.
Ann Perkins,Did that sound weird?
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, everything's fine."
Ann Perkins,"First of all, this is Evelyn."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Ann Perkins,She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.
Evelyn,There really wasn't a ton of work for me there.
Evelyn,Eagletonians are very healthy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes."
Leslie Knope,And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.
Leslie Knope,We've been written about in textbooks.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office."
Ann Perkins,I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I feel sorry for her.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann."
Leslie Knope,With your tiny little doll feet.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
Ann Perkins,"I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Did somebody put you up to this?
Leslie Knope,Was it Evelyn?
Leslie Knope,I knew she was a monster.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, look at that."
Ann Perkins,It's waffles!
Ann Perkins,Delicious waffles.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Should we try?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's try."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what were you saying?"
Ann Perkins,Try.
Ann Perkins,Just enjoy.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,There we go.
Leslie Knope,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,I am thinking about leaving.
Leslie Knope,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""I'm leaving Pawnee not!"""
Ann Perkins,I don't do that.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that you had started.
Ann Perkins,It's not definite.
Ann Perkins,It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.
Ann Perkins,And I have a whole family in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.
Ann Perkins,And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.
Ann Perkins,Do you hear that galloping?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Ann Perkins,"Wha oh my, my look at that!"
Ann Perkins,Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.
Ann Perkins,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"I'm super busy, so you can let yourself"
Leslie Knope,"Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Tynnyfer,You have to text me.
April Ludgate,I will.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery."
Leslie Knope,So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?
April Ludgate,Totally.
April Ludgate,"Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding."
April Ludgate,We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!
April Ludgate,"Like, talking, like, so much forever."
Tynnyfer,It was all so delicious.
April Ludgate,"I know, right?"
Tynnyfer,"This is, like, the best day ever."
April Ludgate,"I know, I'm eating it all up."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.
April Ludgate,Totes.
April Ludgate,"Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other."
April Ludgate,Slut and Skank.
April Ludgate,"How crazemazing is that, Lez?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?"
Leslie Knope,Commitment.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.
Leslie Knope,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Tynnyfer, do you have kids?"
Tynnyfer,"Ew, no."
Tynnyfer,I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.
April Ludgate,You know it.
Donna Meagle,I guess we can make a switch to Bermuda grass.
Donna Meagle,It's only 80 cents more per square foot?
Craig Middlebrooks,What?
Craig Middlebrooks,Gimme gimme gimme.
Craig Middlebrooks,You want me to put Bermuda grass in a continental climate that's a six on Beaufort scale?
Craig Middlebrooks,In a park with zero drainage?
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want Kentucky bluegrass, I want a 10 percent discount, and I want you to apologize to my best friend Donna!"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, hi."
Donna Meagle,Is there and I'm just guessing here some kind of medication that you maybe need a lot of and have taken none of or maybe too much of today?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, I have a medical condition all right."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's called caring too much!
Craig Middlebrooks,And it's incurable!
Craig Middlebrooks,Also I have eczema.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself."
Ron Dunn,"Well, I love the outdoors, love nature."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Dunn,I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.
Ron Dunn,Recycling and composting and the like.
Ron Dunn,I'm a yoga nut.
Ron Dunn,And I'm a nut nut.
Ron Dunn,"They make delicious milks, man."
Ron Dunn,"And I'm a vegan, of course."
Ron Dunn,Slowly working toward full freegan vegan.
Ron Swanson,What in God's name is freegan vegan?
Leslie Knope,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.
Ron Swanson,"What is on your foot, sir?"
Ron Dunn,My trusty sandals.
Ron Dunn,I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.
Ron Dunn,Same goes for all chickens.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else."
Leslie Knope,So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?
Ron Dunn,"As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good."
Ron Dunn,"In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, ""If you want to be free, be free."""
Ron Swanson,I no longer like Ron.
Tom Haverford,ERIC is an amazing program.
Tom Haverford,"Fast, fun and easy to use."
Tom Haverford,But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at talking mad trash till I get what I want.
Tom Haverford,This guy Eric is a disaster.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,Just a bad attitude.
Tom Haverford,"""Oh, I hate this place."""
Tom Haverford,"""Get me out here."""
Tom Haverford,That kind of thing.
Tom Haverford,And unreliable.
Tom Haverford,And racist.
Tom Haverford,I think he may have even been to jail.
Tom Haverford,"Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's not good.
Leslie Knope,I should probably talk to him.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let me see if can turn him around."
Tom Haverford,I don't want to put this on your plate.
Tom Haverford,You have a lot to deal with.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You're the best.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government."
Ben Wyatt,400 Segway scooters.
Ben Wyatt,Sell 'em.
Ben Wyatt,They're gone.
Ben Wyatt,You had six fulltime baristas on the payroll.
Ben Wyatt,The baristas are gone.
Ben Wyatt,As are the masseurs.
Ben Wyatt,And the fulltime barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.
Chris Traeger,It is excellent having the old band back together again.
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,This calls for some celebratory lunges.
Chris Traeger,One two
Leslie Knope,"All right, Donna."
Leslie Knope,There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, your job is secure, of course."
Leslie Knope,You're basically the glue of this department.
Leslie Knope,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.
Donna Meagle,"No, you should keep him."
Donna Meagle,"He's crazy intense, but I've never met anyone who cares more about this job."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Donna, I'm right here."
Donna Meagle,No joke.
Donna Meagle,He might care more than you.
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, if I had to choose between him and me, I'd choose him."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what are you saying?"
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking about leaving?
Donna Meagle,"I wasn't planning on it, but I could."
Donna Meagle,"You know, I got the condo in Seattle, the fiance in Denver."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Donna Meagle,It won't last.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Even Larry wants out?
Leslie Knope,What the hell is happening here?
Leslie Knope,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?
Ann Perkins,"Okeydokey, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You're mad at me.
Ann Perkins,Don't take it out on everybody else.
Ann Perkins,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?"
Leslie Knope,"He had, and I quote, ""no comment."""
Leslie Knope,How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?
Leslie Knope,It just doesn't make any sense!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I can't understand you.
Leslie Knope,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!
Leslie Knope,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.
Leslie Knope,I am the merger czar.
Leslie Knope,I make the rules.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.
Ron Swanson,"Knope, what are these contracts?"
Leslie Knope,It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.
Leslie Knope,"Basic boilerplate language, 50 year commitment, blah, blah, blah."
April Ludgate,"I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach."
Tom Haverford,"When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers."
Ron Swanson,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,What's the big deal?
Leslie Knope,I'm just trying to stop time with legally binding friendship contracts.
Leslie Knope,What part of that do you not understand?
Ron Swanson,You have lost your mind.
April Ludgate,"I think you need a spa day, Les."
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,You only have to work here until I'm dead!
Leslie Knope,Is that better?
Ron Swanson,What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?
Ron Dunn,Yerba matte tea.
Ron Dunn,Sweetened with stevia.
Ron Dunn,It's an allnatural plant extract.
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ron Dunn,No need to curse.
Ron Swanson,There most certainly is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room."
Leslie Knope,"All Pawnee people, sit at your desks."
Leslie Knope,And take it personally.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow."
Leslie Knope,"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard."
Leslie Knope,But do not worry.
Leslie Knope,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out."
Leslie Knope,Mmm!
Leslie Knope,Sugar mustard.
Ron Dunn,"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me."
Ron Dunn,I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.
Leslie Knope,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, what's your story, new Ann?"
Leslie Knope,You're kind of pretty.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential."
Evelyn,"Thank you, but I don't work in this department."
Leslie Knope,"Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't have time for this.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm halfway through designing a bamboo gazebo as a tribute to the founders of Motown.
Leslie Knope,That's so Craig.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Craig!"
Leslie Knope,"We have fun, don't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!"""
Leslie Knope,Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Ron Swanson,"This way, please."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends."
Leslie Knope,Let me go!
Leslie Knope,"Best friends, attack Ron!"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today."
Chris Traeger,It's been like watching Leonardo work.
Chris Traeger,Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
Chris Traeger,You're that good.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, man."
Ben Wyatt,I was in the zone today.
Ben Wyatt,This really has been a lot of fun.
Ben Wyatt,The old juice is back!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, should we keep this going?"
Ben Wyatt,"Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that's a great idea."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, you know what?"
Chris Traeger,I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.
Ben Wyatt,Me?
Tynnyfer,Can I just say something?
Tynnyfer,I'm having so much fun right now.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, me too."
April Ludgate,"Like, so much fun."
April Ludgate,"Can I just say something, though?"
Tynnyfer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,You don't want this job.
April Ludgate,"Seriously, this place is the pits."
April Ludgate,"It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, ""Ugh!"""
April Ludgate,"And Leslie would be like, ""Blah, blah, blah."""
April Ludgate,"And you'd be like, ""Uh"""
Tynnyfer,"Okay, can I say something?"
Tynnyfer,"Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,Can I just say something?
Tynnyfer,Yes!
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,You should totally stay at my house in Miami.
Tynnyfer,What?
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Come by anytime.
April Ludgate,Just let yourself in.
April Ludgate,"The gate kind of jams sometimes, but you can just jump it."
Tynnyfer,You are so amazing right now.
Tynnyfer,You're like skinny Mother Theresa.
April Ludgate,It's Dwayne Wade's house.
April Ludgate,I got his address off the Internet.
April Ludgate,I really hope he's there when she walks in and he throws a basketball at her head.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, enough is enough."
Ron Swanson,"What is wrong with you, woman?"
Leslie Knope,I don't need to explain myself to you! I am the czar.
Leslie Knope,I can do as I please.
Leslie Knope,Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar! Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Moving, with Chris."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's nice."
Leslie Knope,"Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice."
Leslie Knope,"This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!"
Leslie Knope,"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say."
Ron Swanson,"That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,I don't even need her.
Leslie Knope,"I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet."
Leslie Knope,Those are my real friends.
Ron Swanson,"You can't force friendship, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,It takes time.
Ron Swanson,I once thought I had a friend.
Ron Swanson,Then it turned out he was the single worst person I have ever met.
Ron Dunn,"I agree with Ron, Leslie."
Ron Dunn,It's like Moz once said.
Ron Dunn,"""Hold on to your friends."""
Ron Dunn,Morrissey.
Ron Dunn,The Smiths.
Ron Dunn,You don't know Meat Is Murder? It's one of the best songs ever written about industrialized beef consumption.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron."
Leslie Knope,I think it might be time for you to go.
Leslie Knope,"This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department."
Ron Dunn,Fair enough.
Ron Dunn,I should have seen it.
Ron Dunn,"Taurus and Capricorns never mix, do they? Just remember, Ron."
Ron Dunn,Giving in to hate is like drinking saltwater.
Ron Dunn,The thirst only grows worse.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, remove this man before I commit an act of violence against him."
Ron Dunn,"Whatever you do, I won't fight back."
Tom Haverford,"After I defeated him in an epic struggle, ERIC is gone."
Tom Haverford,He's been replaced by T.O.M.
Tom Haverford,Town-wide organizational matrix.
Donna Meagle,"Big plans tonight, Craig?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, I have a ton of work to do."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Plus, my DVR is 13 months pregnant with episodes of Scandal."
Donna Meagle,Scandal's my favorite show.
Donna Meagle,"I love every character, except for Mellie."
Craig Middlebrooks,Oh! Of course you like Scandal! Because you're amazing! I love you.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And no matter what happens with this job, I will always love you."
Craig Middlebrooks,Excuse me! Who even are you?
Ben Wyatt,How's your salad?
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's called the ""Good Earth Salad,"" but really, it's just cheese, toffee, and gummy bear worms."
Chris Traeger,This town is really unhealthy.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day."
Chris Traeger,I actually think it's something else.
Chris Traeger,"Back in the day, this was all we had."
Chris Traeger,"We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems."
Chris Traeger,We'd go back to some rundown motel.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd exercise."
Ben Wyatt,"I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed."
Chris Traeger,"But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,It's a good thing.
Ben Wyatt,But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.
Chris Traeger,"Just so you know, we're thinking of moving."
Chris Traeger,Don't know where yet.
Chris Traeger,"Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,That makes me kind of sad.
Ben Wyatt,But also incredibly happy for you and Ann.
Ben Wyatt,We have come a long way.
Chris Traeger,Something healthy! A cherry tomato.
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,A gumball.
Ben Wyatt,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"What I really want to say is, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing is just scary and confusing.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means."
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Evelyn,I guess it's good.
Evelyn,"Again, I barely know you or Ann, so I don't have much to go off of."
Leslie Knope,Well
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann."
