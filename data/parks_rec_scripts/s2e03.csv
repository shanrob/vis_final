Leslie Knope,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,A couple of announcements.
Leslie Knope,"As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery."
Leslie Knope,So I got him flowers from all of us.
Leslie Knope,"So everybody needs to pitch in, like, 90 dollars."
April Ludgate,90 dollars?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine."
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you're definitely getting some."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,Time will tell.
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,You get to be a judge in that thing?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."
Tom Haverford,But I want to be a judge.
April Ludgate,I can't believe you like beauty pageants.
Leslie Knope,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town."
Leslie Knope,"And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Talent and Poise.
Tom Haverford,It's the strip club by the VA hospital.
Tom Haverford,I have some meetings there.
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,What's disgusting is the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,Do not go to the Glitter Factory.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
April Ludgate,"So, I was just at The Grind and I thought you might want an iced mocha with extra, extra whipped cream."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, April."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge."
Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy."
April Ludgate,Beauty pageants are idiotic.
April Ludgate,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,I can be idiotic for 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,"So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?"
Leslie Knope,"April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism."
Leslie Knope,You and I are like family.
April Ludgate,The coffee is 7 dollars.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Tom Haverford,Just bump that clown.
Tom Haverford,Tell them they already have another Asian judge.
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you so much, I owe you."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Peace.
Tom Haverford,Guess who's also gonna be a judge in the beauty pageant?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Tom Haverford,I know a guy.
Tom Haverford,I had to call in a few favors.
Tom Haverford,"But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What you doing in these parts?
Dave Sanderson,I just came by to see the murals.
Dave Sanderson,This one's pretty amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, this one's a beauty."
Leslie Knope,"You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven."
Leslie Knope,"The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting."""
Leslie Knope,"But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons."
Dave Sanderson,She's got him by the hair pretty good there.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie's really cool, and she's smart."
Dave Sanderson,It's a little intimidating.
Dave Sanderson,"To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals."
Dave Sanderson,I came to ask her on a date.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, Leslie, I really like you."
Dave Sanderson,"And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah, sure."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Let me check my schedule.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's see.
Dave Sanderson,Is that your grandma?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's Madeleine Albright.
Dave Sanderson,That's her name?
Dave Sanderson,"Cause I usually just call mine ""Nana."""
Leslie Knope,"No, that's Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,The first female Secretary of State.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, so, not-- That's not your grandma, then."
Dave Sanderson,All right.
Dave Sanderson,I got it.
Dave Sanderson,How's that schedule looking?
Leslie Knope,"Good, a couple days are free."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we could just, you know"
Dave Sanderson,Just lock it in later?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,Talk later about it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Ladies.
Leslie Knope,You want to hear something awful?
Leslie Knope,He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.
Ann Perkins,Who?
Leslie Knope,"Not you, too."
Leslie Knope,"Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,Who didn't know?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave."
Leslie Knope,That cop that I met.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?"
Ann Perkins,I've never dated anyone who loves giving vaccinations.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Weird question for you.
Ann Perkins,Are you handy?
Ann Perkins,"Like, can you fix things?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, what's broken?"
Ann Perkins,My shower.
Ann Perkins,"It's leaky, low pressure, just all around terrible."
Mark Brendanawicz,Easy.
Mark Brendanawicz,You want me to come over after work?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Amazing.
Ann Perkins,"I will cook you a cheap, quick dinner that will be no trouble at all for me."
Mark Brendanawicz,Great.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'll see you tonight, for the weirdest second date ever."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow judges."
Leslie Knope,"I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,He's also gonna be a judge.
Jessica Wicks,Hi.
Jessica Wicks,"Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Tom Haverford,I recognized you right away.
Tom Haverford,And may I say that you look even more beautiful now than you did when you won the crown.
Jessica Wicks,"Ooh, I like you!"
Ray Holstead,Hello.
Ray Holstead,"Ray Holstead, Ray's Sandwich Place."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course, Ray."
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Ray Holstead,Fine.
Charles Woliner,I'm Charles Woliner.
Charles Woliner,I've judged every Miss Pawnee Pageant for the last 30 years.
Charles Woliner,I made Jessica.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom and I are very happy to be here."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sure between the five of us, we will choose the most well-rounded, intelligent, modern and forward thinking woman to represent our fine town."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Tom Haverford,You don't believe me?
Tom Haverford,Watch.
Tom Haverford,"34C, 36B, 34B, 34D. 32A? How did you get in here?"
Tom Haverford,I'm just kidding.
Tom Haverford,"You're perfect, each and every one of you."
Tom Haverford,God bless.
Announcer,"Here they are, your candidates for Miss Pawnee."
Announcer,"Well, let's meet the girls, shall we?"
Announcer,"First up, please welcome April Ludgate."
April Ludgate,"Hello, I'm April Ludgate."
April Ludgate,I'm 20 years old.
April Ludgate,"I like people, places and things!"
April Ludgate,And Pawnee is my favorite place in the world!
Announcer,"Next up, please welcome Susan Gleever."
Susan Gleever,"Hi, everyone."
Susan Gleever,I'm Susan.
Susan Gleever,"I'm a history major at Indiana State, I play classical piano, and I volunteer at the Children's Hospital."
Announcer,"Thank you, Susan."
Leslie Knope,She's good.
Announcer,"Next, Trish lanetta."
Trish Ianetta,"Hi, y'all."
Trish Ianetta,I'm Trish.
Trish Ianetta,"I'm 22 years old, I've been on YouTube."
Trish Ianetta,"I just I love to hang out with my friends, I love to laugh, I love the summertime and going to the beach, and I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there."
Trish Ianetta,I just want everyone--
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, they can't all be winners."
Trish Ianetta,Are y'all having a good time?
Tom Haverford,"Looks like we got a frontrunner, guys!"
Announcer,"And now it's time for our ever popular talent competition, where our ladies will each demonstrate their excellent skills."
Tom Haverford,"Here we have Leslie's custom scorecard, with categories such as, presentation, intelligence, knowledge of ""herstory"", fruitful gestures, je ne sais quoi, and something called ""The Naomi Wolf Factor."""
Announcer,"And our first one up is Trish lanetta, whose talent is baton."
Tom Haverford,My girl Trish is talented.
Leslie Knope,She's not even twirling the baton.
April Ludgate,I'm going to do impressions.
Announcer,"Oh, celebrity impressions."
Announcer,That's wild.
Announcer,Wild stuff.
April Ludgate,Yep.
April Ludgate,This is an impression of my sister.
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm Natalie."
April Ludgate,I love Ritalin and have low self-esteem.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"This is an impression of my boss, Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,Women should do everything.
April Ludgate,Check out my four color pen.
April Ludgate,"Hey, everybody."
April Ludgate,Listen up while I talk about some really important stuff.
April Ludgate,"Parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, Michelle Obama, parks."
April Ludgate,"Gay penguins, parks, sugar, parks."
Leslie Knope,She got me.
Leslie Knope,She got me good.
Leslie Knope,She got
Extra,"Ooh It's so good, it's so good It's so good, it's so good, it's so good"
Tom Haverford,I'm texting Trish to tell her how good she did earlier.
Leslie Knope,"No, Susan isn't a perfect 10."
Leslie Knope,"But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense ofâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Over here.
Ann Perkins,How's it going in here?
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,I hooked your toilet up to your shower.
Mark Brendanawicz,"That's what you wanted, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Excellent.
Ann Perkins,Was that Andy?
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,I know you're in there because I can see you through the screen.
Andy Dwyer,Ann!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,Do you live down here?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you live down here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe this is happening!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I can't be at my house and see my exboyfriend living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher.
Ann Perkins,"That's so weird, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you."
Andy Dwyer,"Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good."
Ann Perkins,You've been here a whole week?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,One week only.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to work to every day."
Ann Perkins,Excellent.
Andy Dwyer,Listen.
Andy Dwyer,Are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies that I told you?
Ann Perkins,I can't do this right now.
Ann Perkins,I have a guy fixing my bathroom.
Ann Perkins,I got to go.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's cool."
Andy Dwyer,"I got to zoom out, too, 'cause I have some people coming over."
Andy Dwyer,"So, why don't you call first next time?"
Andy Dwyer,You know the way out.
Announcer,"All right, it's time now for the dreaded Q&A."
Announcer,And the first question goes to Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I have a question for the hot one."
Tom Haverford,"First off, I just want to say I'm a little bit surprised, because I didn't think angels could fly so low."
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"You truly are a beautiful, beautiful woman."
Trish Ianetta,You're so funny.
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Announcer,"Do you have a question, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America ""The Great Experiment."""
Leslie Knope,What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?
Trish Ianetta,"Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up."
Trish Ianetta,But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.
Trish Ianetta,"No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it ""Ourmerica,"" and not ""Theirmerica."""
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Don't applaud that.
Leslie Knope,"No, she didn't-- She didn't answer my question."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not ideal.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you should try to relax.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I peeked."
Mark Brendanawicz,I also didn't see any toothpaste.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you not use toothpaste?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him."
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like we should invite him inside.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have you not been listening to anything I just said?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?"
Announcer,"Okay, folks, just a couple more contestants, and then the judges will decide our next Miss Pawnee, a winner of 600 dollars in gift certificates to Big Archie's Sporting Goods and Emerson Fencing Company."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,We don't get cash?
April Ludgate,This is for a fence?
Announcer,"Well, it won't cover a whole fence."
Announcer,But it will defray the cost considerably!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Announcer,"Okay, I guess she really is quitting."
April Ludgate,"No, I didn't win."
April Ludgate,But at least I didn't make any new friendships.
Tom Haverford,"So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?"
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,We're all in agreement.
Tom Haverford,"The hot one, by a landslide."
Leslie Knope,"Well, her name is Trish."
Leslie Knope,"And I don't think we should rush this, you know?"
Jessica Wicks,What is there to talk about?
Jessica Wicks,"I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable."
Leslie Knope,"Well, take Susan, for example."
Leslie Knope,I think--
Tom Haverford,Susan Boring Stories?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,It's Trish.
Tom Haverford,Let's go back out there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year."
Leslie Knope,She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.
Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial."
Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.
Jessica Wicks,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past."
Jessica Wicks,And I think Trish is a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?"
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I packed a suitcase."
Ray Holstead,"I have to say, Leslie does make a good point."
Ray Holstead,Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ray."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I like what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,Let's keep talking.
Ann Perkins,Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.
Andy Dwyer,"Is Mark the guy who's ""fixing your shower""?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn."
Andy Dwyer,"And I know what ""fixing your shower"" means."
Ann Perkins,Andyâ¦
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, you guys are on a date."
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's all right."
Andy Dwyer,Don't let me interrupt your date.
Ann Perkins,Keep eating.
Andy Dwyer,I already ate.
Andy Dwyer,I'm super full.
Andy Dwyer,I don't I don't want any.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?"""
Announcer,It's the hot one.
Announcer,Trish lanetta!
Mark Brendanawicz,These are amazing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you... Do you put a little hot sauce on these or something?
Ann Perkins,A good chef never reveals her secrets.
Andy Dwyer,It's hot sauce.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is an extraordinary cook.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,Memories.
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more? Are you hungry still?
Andy Dwyer,"You know what's funny? I was just sitting over here on the couch and I was thinking, that there was once a time when Mark used to be the stranger in the house."
Andy Dwyer,And now it's me.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Especially Susan.
Leslie Knope,"This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last."
Leslie Knope,"Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains."
Leslie Knope,"And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together."
Leslie Knope,"I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all--"
Trish Ianetta,"One, two, three!"
Jessica Wicks,"One, two, three!"
Andy Dwyer,"As usual, Ann, a delicious meal."
Andy Dwyer,Are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee?
Ann Perkins,We are leaving.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I get it."
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm very good at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, Mark."
Ann Perkins,"No, dummy."
Ann Perkins,Just you.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Ann Perkins,Take care of yourself.
Andy Dwyer,"Just don't worry about me, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Okay? I'll be fine.
Andy Dwyer,"That went really well! We had dinner! I got to see her! Oh, God, I was so tempted to look back at her."
Andy Dwyer,Was she looking? I had to walk so slow.
Andy Dwyer,A good day.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well, look who's here."
Tom Haverford,It's Officer John McClane.
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to the party, pal."
Dave Sanderson,Who's that?
Tom Haverford,Die Hard.
Dave Sanderson,The battery?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you know the other day I asked you if you wanted to have coffee?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,You said yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, and then afterwards, I saw you again, you kind of acted like you didn't want to have coffee anymore."
Dave Sanderson,We left it kind of open-ended.
Leslie Knope,We did.
Dave Sanderson,And that's made me uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"So I thought I'd come in and ask you, and just get some clearance on this."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, I like you."
Dave Sanderson,"I like you, too."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, so, we'll get coffee, then."
Leslie Knope,But I'm just busy.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my schedule is just so full."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I get it."
Dave Sanderson,"Look, I'm not a guy who plays games."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I just came to tell you that I like you, and I like coffee and I If you want to get some coffee, here's my number."
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, coming through, buddy."
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,I got your message.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Thanks for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'd love to go out with you."
Leslie Knope,How about Friday for dinner?
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,Great.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, will Sandra Day O'Connor and Michelle Obama and Condoleezza Rice and Nancy Pelosi, are they gonna join us?"
Leslie Knope,"No, they will not be joining us."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, well, good, 'cause I don't happen to agree with Miss Pelosi's views about the Troubled Assets Relief Program."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Dave Sanderson,I looked that up to impress you.
Leslie Knope,I figured.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"If you guys like grilling, you want to come over and use my grill--"
Tom Haverford,"Look, let me do you a favor."
Tom Haverford,Take a key.
Tom Haverford,"Just come by, grill up whatever you want."
Tom Haverford,This is one of my favorite pick-up strategies.
Tom Haverford,I'm constantly giving one of my keys.
Trish Ianetta,This is your house key?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I just happened to have a spare.
Tom Haverford,"Just come by, go for a dip, whenever you want."
Tom Haverford,"So far, none of them have shown up."
Ann Perkins,"That's a very appealing offer, thank you."
Tom Haverford,Matter of time.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Craig."
Craig,"Hey, Tommy."
Tom Haverford,"Fifty more copies, please."
Craig,You got it.
Tom Haverford,I have been robbed twice.
