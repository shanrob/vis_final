Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,"Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, ""Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea ""rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone object?
Theodore,"As always, I object."
Garth Blunden,"Nay, enough dithering!"
Garth Blunden,Dump the miscreant!
Garth Blunden,Boo!
Leslie Knope,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817."
Leslie Knope,"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted."""
Leslie Knope,It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake."
Leslie Knope,One!
Theodore,I don't even go by Ted!
Leslie Knope,Two!
Theodore,I go by Theodore!
Leslie Knope,Three!
Theodore,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ted."
Andy Dwyer,Great job today.
Andy Dwyer,"You were so funny when you were like, ""My cell phone, I left it in my pocket."""
Andy Dwyer,"Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work."
Theodore,"Yeah, that was hilarious."
Theodore,"Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day."
Andy Dwyer,Ha!
Andy Dwyer,Classic Ted.
Theodore,I'm serious.
Theodore,I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.
Theodore,"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year."
Leslie Knope,That's the way it's always been done.
Theodore,"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something."
Theodore,"Second, it was a misprint."
Theodore,"They clearly meant ""tea."""
Leslie Knope,I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.
Theodore,"Okay, fine."
Theodore,You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?
Theodore,"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?"
Theodore,Here's a quarter.
Theodore,I own your car now.
Tom Haverford,Wha
Theodore,Sorry.
Theodore,The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.
Leslie Knope,That is an outdated and racist law.
Leslie Knope,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian."""
Theodore,"Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ted."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're quoting me back to me.
Leslie Knope,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.
Theodore,Uhoh.
Theodore,"You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male."
Theodore,"According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this."
Leslie Knope,I was not aware of that statute.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you have to help me."
April Ludgate,Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.
Chris Traeger,"Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or ""Katumts."""
Chris Traeger,"It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar."
April Ludgate,Can you get me out of it?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing."
Ron Swanson,But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.
Ron Swanson,I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe."
Ron Swanson,April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.
Chris Traeger,I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.
Ron Swanson,Which is why this is pointless.
Ron Swanson,"I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any ""management training"" course."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've never been ""katumtsed?"""
Chris Traeger,I am legally required to katumts every department head.
Chris Traeger,"Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability."
Ron Swanson,What are you saying?
Chris Traeger,"I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate."
Chris Traeger,And spoiler alert
April Ludgate,it's Alf.
Chris Traeger,It's you.
Ron Swanson,This went poorly.
Ann Perkins,"What, no."
Ann Perkins,Damn it!
Donna Meagle,What are you bidding on?
Donna Meagle,It better not be Terrence Howard's tank top from Hustle & Flow.
Ann Perkins,It is not.
Donna Meagle,Good.
Donna Meagle,"Cause I am bidding on it and I am ready to spend an amount that my accountant calls ""Dangerous and irresponsible."""
Ann Perkins,JJ's diner put an old waffle iron up for auction.
Ann Perkins,It's the perfect breakfast day gift for Leslie.
Donna Meagle,"""Breakfast day""?"
Ann Perkins,Leslie has anniversaries for everything.
Ann Perkins,"""Zoo day,"" first time we went to the zoo together."
Ann Perkins,"""Double date day,"" it was the first time we went on a double date."
Ann Perkins,"""Daniel DayLewis day."""
Ann Perkins,"""Talk like a pirate day""."
Ann Perkins,"Talk like a Pittsburgh pirate day,"" which why and how?"
Ann Perkins,This calendar was last year's calendar day present celebrating the first time she ever bought me a calendar.
Donna Meagle,You have to buy a present for every one of these?
Ann Perkins,"She always tells me not to, but then she buys me something that's awesome and thoughtful, and then I feel terrible."
Ann Perkins,But that's the thing.
Ann Perkins,This is the perfect present.
Ann Perkins,"I just keep getting outbid by someone named ""Tall Tiereeon Lannister."""
Ann Perkins,What kind of name is Tiereeon anyway?
Donna Meagle,"You're kidding, right?"
Donna Meagle,Tyrion Lannister?
Donna Meagle,Lord of Casterly Rock?
Donna Meagle,The Half Man?
Donna Meagle,You don't watch Game of Thrones?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,You do?
Donna Meagle,Hell yeah.
Donna Meagle,Have you seen those Dothraki dudes?
Donna Meagle,They can get it.
Donna Meagle,Everybody on that show can get it.
Ann Perkins,I think I know who I'm bidding against.
Leslie Knope,"I now realize that I was wrong, and it's time that we purged the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws."
Leslie Knope,"The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day."
Leslie Knope,The floor is now open for public comments.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here we go."
Garth Blunden,Thank you.
Garth Blunden,"My name is Garth Blunden, and I object to your ridiculous proposal."
Garth Blunden,The Pawnee Charter shall not be changed.
Garth Blunden,"Not today, not ever!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blunden."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.
Leslie Knope,Shall we proceed to a vote?
Garth Blunden,No.
Garth Blunden,"No, we shall not."
Garth Blunden,"Article Seven, Section Three allows for a ""Citizen filibuster."""
Garth Blunden,"If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill."
Leslie Knope,"That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency."
Garth Blunden,Is that the Buffalo meat one?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Garth Blunden,"I meant Article Three, Section Seven."
Garth Blunden,Let the filibustering begin.
Garth Blunden,I would now like to share some ideas I have for J.J. Abrams' seventh chapter in the Star Wars' saga.
Garth Blunden,Pan down from the twin suns of Tatooine.
Garth Blunden,We are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc Pit.
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, the gloved Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside of the Sarlacc Pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, he's right."
Leslie Knope,He can do this.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.
Leslie Knope,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.
Garth Blunden,"If he holds the reality gem, that means he can jump from different realities."
Garth Blunden,This will be our link to the Marvel Universe from the Star Wars Universe.
Garth Blunden,Imagine those who were up against Chewbacca 'cause that's gonna happen.
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, Luke says, ""Darth Vader was my father, but Ben Kenobi was my master."""
Garth Blunden,And he cuts Hannibal Lecter in half.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Blunden, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.
Garth Blunden,You can't just change the charter willynilly.
Garth Blunden,"You start by casually repealing a couple of ""old laws,"" the next thing you know, your jackbooted storm troopers are kicking in my door and arresting my wife for no reason if I were married."
Leslie Knope,"By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Clyde."
Extra,"Hi, Leslie."
Extra,Good Danish today.
Garth Blunden,"The Pawnee charter is not a ""living document,"" Ms. Knope."
Garth Blunden,You have no respect for the traditions of this town.
Leslie Knope,I absolutely do.
Leslie Knope,I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.
Leslie Knope,"Three times, ""Employee Of The Fortnight."""
Garth Blunden,"Oh, big deal, you put on a costume for a couple hours."
Garth Blunden,"By that logic, every time I go to bed at night, I am Wolverine."
Leslie Knope,You bought XMen pajamas?
Garth Blunden,"I won them, madam, in a raffle."
Leslie Knope,"The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground."
Leslie Knope,It was a more primitive time.
Garth Blunden,It was a better time.
Garth Blunden,You wouldn't have survived two weeks in their day.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,How about a little wager?
Leslie Knope,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill."
Leslie Knope,"I win, you stop this nonsense."
Garth Blunden,You have yourself a deal.
Chris Traeger,"Please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar, seal it in the envelope, and then we'll open it when it's over."
Ron Swanson,When is this over?
Chris Traeger,As soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation.
Chris Traeger,It's a nine hour seminar over two days.
April Ludgate,Whoa!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, good."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's begin."
Chris Traeger,"Hop on board ""The Management Train."""
Chris Traeger,First stop Motivation Station.
Chris Traeger,All aboard!
Ann Perkins,Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
Ben Wyatt,You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?
Ann Perkins,"I made that profile, like, ten years ago."
Ann Perkins,I don't know how to change it.
Ann Perkins,The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for breakfast day.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, no, you're not."
Ben Wyatt,I'm getting it for her for waffle day.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, you have a breakfast day too?"
Ben Wyatt,Mine's in June.
Ann Perkins,"Please, Ben."
Ann Perkins,"This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, imagine being married to her."
Ben Wyatt,It's like being smothered with a hand quilted pillow filled with cherished memories.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, honey."
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,We've lost the auction.
Ann Perkins,What no.
Ben Wyatt,"Somebody swooped in at the last second, and now we're both screwed."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't."
Ben Wyatt,"The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example."
Ann Perkins,This is why we don't hang out.
Chris Traeger,Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, you don't ""steer"" a locomotive."
Ron Swanson,The tracks do.
Ron Swanson,"Second, there are only three ways to motivate people money, fear, and hunger."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I disagree."
Chris Traeger,"What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles."
Chris Traeger,"When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity."
April Ludgate,Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for your input, April, but the katumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus."
April Ludgate,"You're not being very inclusive, Chris."
April Ludgate,I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.
April Ludgate,You've killed my spirit.
April Ludgate,My spirit blood is on your hands.
Chris Traeger,"My God, I've taught you so much already."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I propose a challenge to see whose motivational methods are more effective."
Ron Swanson,Challenge accepted.
Chris Traeger,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but this is literally a battle for April's soul."
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but I don't really care what happens here."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,I hate this place.
Tom Haverford,Everything is old.
Tom Haverford,Old things are dumb.
Tom Haverford,"It's like, just be new."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.
Tom Haverford,That is a dope bonnet.
Garth Blunden,"Oh, just getting here, I see."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,Did you sleep here last night?
Garth Blunden,Indeed.
Garth Blunden,I want to be here when the cock crows to get the chores done.
Garth Blunden,"Already, I've done the preserves and chased off an interloping cable installer."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail."
Leslie Knope,Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, Tom, you will be our referees."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for volunteering.
Tom Haverford,Definitely didn't volunteer.
Tom Haverford,I had much better things to do.
Tom Haverford,Leslie said she'd pay me 100 bucks.
Andy Dwyer,And I had nothing better to do.
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing it for free.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I'm losing this contest.
Leslie Knope,Oldtimey dress?
Leslie Knope,Check.
Leslie Knope,Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Rickets?
Leslie Knope,Cured.
Leslie Knope,Don't need to worry about rickets.
Leslie Knope,Antiperspirant?
Leslie Knope,Not allowed.
Leslie Knope,Might get a little rough in there.
Ben Wyatt,I was wondering if you could help me out.
Herman,Say no more.
Herman,Here's a bunch of guns.
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,Different thing.
Ben Wyatt,I saw that you recently won an auction for the JJ's diner waffle iron.
Ben Wyatt,And I'd like to that's it right there.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to buy it.
Ben Wyatt,You and everyone else.
Ann Perkins,"Hello, Ben."
Ann Perkins,Seems like I love Leslie more than you do.
Ann Perkins,Get in line.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,"Get in line, pal."
Ben Wyatt,Who are you?
Extra,I'm Roz.
Extra,"I'm Leslie's mailwoman, and I need to get her a Mail Day present by next Wednesday."
Extra,It's the anniversary of the first
Ben Wyatt,Time you delivered her mail.
Ann Perkins,Time you delivered her mail.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we get it."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we get it."
Herman,Looks like we've got ourselves an oldfashioned pawnshop waffle iron bidding war.
Herman,"Let's start the bidding at 650,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll counter with 100 bucks."
Ann Perkins,200
Extra,I'll let you take anything out of this bag.
Herman,"I'll tell you what, Ann."
Herman,I'll give it to you if you go on a date with me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"I can't believe I'm about to do this, but fine."
Ann Perkins,One date.
Ann Perkins,But let me make one thing perfectly clear
Ben Wyatt,500 bucks.
Herman,Sold.
Ann Perkins,What?
Herman,You still want to go out?
Herman,I just come into some money.
Herman,$500 buys a lot of nitrous.
Garth Blunden,"Yeah, nothing warms the blood like an old whirlybout with the old buttergyre, eh, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,Indeed.
Leslie Knope,"Man, this guy's tougher than I thought."
Tom Haverford,I don't know how either of you guys are doing this.
Tom Haverford,"One time my refrigerator stopped working, I didn't know what to do."
Tom Haverford,I just moved.
Leslie Knope,I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.
Leslie Knope,He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow."
Andy Dwyer,That is really good.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,This tastes great.
Andy Dwyer,All my favorite foods have butter on 'em.
Andy Dwyer,"Pancakes, toast, popcorn, grapes."
Andy Dwyer,Butter is my favorite food.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up."
Leslie Knope,"Take a look at Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is horrifying.
Leslie Knope,Nobody eat that.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm in over my head.
Leslie Knope,Garth really knows his stuff.
Leslie Knope,He planted an entire field of barley.
Leslie Knope,How long is he planning on staying here?
Garth Blunden,"Hey, um, aren't we husband and wife in this scenario?"
Garth Blunden,"I mean, like, shouldn't you"
Leslie Knope,Not a chance.
Garth Blunden,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's that?"
Leslie Knope,Do you guys feel that?
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,How long was that under there?
Tom Haverford,"Man, Garth is a machine."
Tom Haverford,He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.
Leslie Knope,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.
Leslie Knope,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.
Garth Blunden,Whee!
Garth Blunden,"Look at my hoop, Leslie."
Garth Blunden,Look at my hoop!
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Who could live like this?
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,That's why we've moved on.
Leslie Knope,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something."
Leslie Knope,"It's so, so, so fun."
Andy Dwyer,"So, so fun."
Leslie Knope,But to live like this is insane.
Leslie Knope,He must have cheated somehow.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long."
Leslie Knope,We should check his phone.
Garth Blunden,"Goodness, how delicious eating goober peas"
Chris Traeger,Jerry Gergich.
Chris Traeger,I need you to stop whatever it is you're doing and file as many of these as you can.
Jerry Gergich,"Wow, Duraflex cuttop A350s in deep maroon?"
Jerry Gergich,The honor is all mine.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I knew you were the man for the job."
Chris Traeger,You are smart and capable.
Chris Traeger,And I believe you can accomplish anything.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Chris Traeger,"You got it, champ."
Chris Traeger,Get filing.
Jerry Gergich,"Aye, aye, Captain."
Chris Traeger,That is one motivated worker bee.
Donna Meagle,You guys doing experiments on Jerry?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now let's not read anything."
Leslie Knope,That's an invasion of his privacy.
Leslie Knope,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,It's true.
Tom Haverford,He hasn't gotten an email in 12 days. Is he a ghost?
Tom Haverford,The only ones he gets are spam.
Tom Haverford,And he responds to them.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm gonna be sick.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,This guy has no friends.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Seems like he's friends with that mule.
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ann Perkins,"Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie out of breakfast food."
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, listen, I've been thinking."
Ben Wyatt,How would you feel about going in on the waffle iron together?
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, whatever it is, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ann Perkins,What should I do with this?
Ben Wyatt,Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once."
Ron Swanson,Begin filing these blue ones.
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,I promised Chris that
Ron Swanson,This is the top priority.
Ron Swanson,I need these blue folders done now.
Ron Swanson,You can eat when you have finished.
Ron Swanson,File!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my goodness."
Ron Swanson,"Money, fear, hunger."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there, Garth."
Leslie Knope,Whatcha whittling?
Garth Blunden,A birthing stick.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Garth Blunden,You do not want to know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Garth Blunden,You look beautiful.
Garth Blunden,"I mean, you changed clothes."
Garth Blunden,Violation.
Garth Blunden,I challenge you are bonnetless!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"I admit, I can't take it anymore."
Leslie Knope,You win.
Garth Blunden,Huzzah!
Garth Blunden,The day is mine.
Garth Blunden,"I'm gonna miss saying ""huzzah."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Garth, I have another proposition."
Garth Blunden,"Yes, I will go out on a date with you, but I realize you're a modern woman, so I will let you pay."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?
Garth Blunden,Those clowns? No thank you.
Garth Blunden,They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use of fonts in their newsletter.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you."
Leslie Knope,"But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such."
Leslie Knope,I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.
Garth Blunden,Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time.
Garth Blunden,My cousin's arraignment is in May.
Garth Blunden,But that's a day.
Garth Blunden,"I just fly out, I come back the same day."
Garth Blunden,"On a trial basis, yes."
Garth Blunden,"Yes, yes."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the team.
Leslie Knope,"Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing."
Leslie Knope,Seems to me we ought to use it.
Leslie Knope,"I did not change Article Two, though."
Leslie Knope,"I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking."
Leslie Knope,Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.
Leslie Knope,"From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition."
Leslie Knope,"This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!"
Garth Blunden,"Huzzah, I'm Ted! I'm Ted!"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm Ted too, guys."
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah! He's naked, everybody! Put that away!"
Andy Dwyer,We're all Ted!
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy!"
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Garth Blunden,Thank God.
Garth Blunden,I don't know how to swim.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, final tally."
Donna Meagle,Jerry filed 268 red files.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Donna Meagle,And 384 blue files.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Wait a minute.
Chris Traeger,How is that possible?
Donna Meagle,"Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it."
Ron Swanson,And the prosecution rests.
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle,"He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong."
Donna Meagle,Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.
Chris Traeger,"Another fascinating edition of ""katumts."""
Chris Traeger,We may never know conclusively which way works better.
Chris Traeger,"But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process."
Chris Traeger,And by that measure I succeeded.
Ron Swanson,And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process.
Ron Swanson,Mission accomplished.
Chris Traeger,What did April write? Where is April?
April Ludgate,I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.
April Ludgate,"They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail."
April Ludgate,Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.
April Ludgate,"Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun."""
Chris Traeger,I think April will be a fine manager.
Ron Swanson,I agree.
April Ludgate,"It's my favorite kind of battle-- Two men enter, one me leaves."
Ben Wyatt,Happy waffle day.
Ann Perkins,Happy breakfast day.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt,But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're both dying.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.
Ann Perkins,"It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them."
Leslie Knope,I'm no better at them than you are.
Leslie Knope,"That's ridiculous, I'm so much better."
Leslie Knope,Point taken.
Ben Wyatt,But we have a compromise.
Ben Wyatt,"Every year, there will be one day, ""Ann Day,"" where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and ""Ben Day"" where we can celebrate all of ours."
Leslie Knope,What about Ann Month and Ben Month?
Ann Perkins,How about a week?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Ben Wyatt,"We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month."
Ann Perkins,We were fine with a week.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
