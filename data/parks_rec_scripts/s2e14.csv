Leslie Knope,"And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown."
Tania,Excuse me?
Tania,Are you cutting our classes?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The city took away 1,000 dollars from our budget."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm very sorry."
Extra,How will you decide which classes to cut?
Leslie Knope,By attendance and student evaluations.
Leslie Knope,"So, just make sure your students leave with a smile."
Extra,"My class is called ""Coping with Terminal Illness."""
Leslie Knope,Hopefully your attendance is good!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no, hopefully it's bad."
Leslie Knope,Nobody's more upset about this than me.
Leslie Knope,I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.
Leslie Knope,"It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing."
Leslie Knope,"The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned."
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,You have never been to Carnival?
Leslie Knope,I want to go!
Justin,"We have to get tickets in February to go to Rio de Janeiro, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,"We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing."
Justin,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,"Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium."
Leslie Knope,That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.
Justin,Why?
Leslie Knope,It's just being really withholding.
Leslie Knope,Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.
Justin,All I did was a little paperwork.
Chef,"He's being modest, it is thanks to him my family remains in this country."
Chef,And it was all pro bono.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Justin."
Justin,You've got to try this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's really good!"
Justin,Isn't it great?
Justin,It's camel stomach.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Justin,"I'm teasing, I'm teasing."
Justin,It's chicken.
Chef,Would you like to try the camel stomach?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Justin,"So, when am I gonna see you again?"
Justin,Oh!
Justin,"You know what, I'm gonna be near Pawnee on Tuesday."
Leslie Knope,"Excellent, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I'll plan something exciting.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water."
Justin,All right.
Justin,I'm gonna hold you to that.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,You better.
Justin,I will!
Leslie Knope,I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family."
Ann Perkins,"Well, maybe just have him over and cook him some chicken and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo."
Leslie Knope,A dinner party!
Leslie Knope,That's genius.
Leslie Knope,"I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party."
Ann Perkins,"No, I actually meant more like a one-on-one thing."
Leslie Knope,"I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better."
Leslie Knope,"It's called a think tank, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What is?
Leslie Knope,Our lunches.
Leslie Knope,Our lunches are like think tanks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready."
Leslie Knope,And make sure that Mark is coming.
Leslie Knope,So much work to do!
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,"Now, get out of here!"
Ron Swanson,How many courses will there be?
Leslie Knope,Three.
Ron Swanson,Hmmâ¦
Leslie Knope,Four.
Leslie Knope,Not including dessert.
Ron Swanson,"So, five courses."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, it will be five courses."
Ron Swanson,"If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?"
Leslie Knope,Just be there at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,I'm having an A list dinner party for Justin.
Leslie Knope,"And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land."
Tom Haverford,South Carolina?
Leslie Knope,Save it for the party.
Leslie Knope,Can you make it?
Tom Haverford,For Justin?
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,I'm there.
Tom Haverford,Just don't invite any boring people like Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,What are you guys talking about?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Check it out.
Andy Dwyer,Just practicing.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,I'm having a partyâ¦
Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.
Leslie Knope,"I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour."
Andy Dwyer,My guardian angel!
Andy Dwyer,I would love to!
Andy Dwyer,Who's going to be there?
Leslie Knope,Really fun people.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann."
Andy Dwyer,That's great.
Andy Dwyer,What's the occasion?
Leslie Knope,Justin is coming into town.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, it's me, Justin."
Andy Dwyer,Take my coat.
Andy Dwyer,"But please, be careful."
Andy Dwyer,I got it from the king of Africa when we were walking on the Berlin Wall together.
Andy Dwyer,"Really, Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,What instruments do you play?
Andy Dwyer,"Actually, he's a pretty sick keyboardist."
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,I'm good to go.
Andy Dwyer,That sounds great.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Andy Dwyer,I'll see you there.
Kyle,"Afternoon, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"You know, right before you sat down, I noticed, did you have some kind of stain on your ass, or something?"
Andy Dwyer,What was that?
Kyle,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,You're good.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to my house, for the very first time."
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you've never had me over.
Ann Perkins,"Now, I can believe it."
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,It's a little messy.
Leslie Knope,But I have a system.
Leslie Knope,"So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything."
Ann Perkins,"This newspaper's from November, 1986."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the first rumblings of Iran Contra!"
Leslie Knope,Don't throw that out!
Ann Perkins,I think I need to call Child Services and have Leslie taken away from herself.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, don't take this the wrong way, but your house is like a crazy person's garage."
Ann Perkins,What do you need this birdhouse for?
Ann Perkins,Can we get rid of it?
Leslie Knope,I might need it.
Ann Perkins,What about this one?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if two birds come along?"
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff."
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,You need a team of professionals to help.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from ""Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman""?"
Tom Haverford,"April, come here."
April Ludgate,What?
Tom Haverford,Shake my hand.
April Ludgate,Why?
Tom Haverford,I can't tell if I've exfoliated too much.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to creep Justin out.
Tom Haverford,I want him to respect my handshake.
April Ludgate,Why do you care about him?
Tom Haverford,Justin is hip.
Tom Haverford,Pawnee is the opposite of hip.
Tom Haverford,People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana.
Tom Haverford,I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Justin."
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,It's like touching raw chicken.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Gonna have to refoliate them.
Maria Portlesman,"I'll need some help moving the boxes, but it's doable."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,How much do I owe you?
Maria Portlesman,Please.
Maria Portlesman,No charge.
Maria Portlesman,I just appreciate the chance to demonstrate how valuable my class is to the rec center.
Maria Portlesman,And I hope you'll keep that in mind.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I insist on paying."
Maria Portlesman,"No, no, I insist on demonstrating."
Leslie Knope,This is not gonna affect my decision at all.
Maria Portlesman,"Oh, of course not."
Leslie Knope,Stop winking.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, I forgot to ask you."
Ann Perkins,What are you cooking?
Leslie Knope,Five courses.
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"So, how's it looking?"
Leslie Knope,It smells great.
Tania,"Okay, the appetizers are almost ready."
Tania,"And I think that they are a very good sampling of what my level one class does, which I hope you'll keep in mind when you're making your decisions."
Leslie Knope,"Tania, like I said over the phone--"
Tania,I know.
Tania,It won't influence your decision.
Tania,It's just that learning to cook is very important in this day and age.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Are you gonna be all right, tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,"What, 'cause of Mark and Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,They are just guests at a really awesome dinner party.
Andy Dwyer,And I will treat them as such.
Leslie Knope,That sounds very professional.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"I promise I will not spit in anyone's food, unless they should request that I do."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Did I do this right?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my humble abode.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, thank you."
Mark Brendanawicz,Whoa!
Mark Brendanawicz,This is way cleaner than the last time I was here.
Ann Perkins,You've been here?
Ann Perkins,Right.
Andy Dwyer,When was Mark here before?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Sex.
Mark Brendanawicz,I can't wait to talk to Justin again.
Mark Brendanawicz,Last time he told me about how he snorkeled with whale sharks in Madagascar.
Mark Brendanawicz,That was after I told him that I sometimes go swimming at the Y.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, thank you, son."
Ron Swanson,Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,I believe you've arranged accommodations for these.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron Swanson."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't happen to hear about the incident with Mayor Gunderson's dog, did you?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,It was a blood bath--
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,No talking.
Leslie Knope,Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.
Leslie Knope,Don't use up your stories.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I think somebody from Animal Services is gonna get canned."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What part of not talking do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,"Please, have a good time and shut your mouth."
Leslie Knope,I just want this dinner party to go well.
Leslie Knope,There are very few things I've asked for in this world.
Leslie Knope,To build a new park from scratch.
Leslie Knope,To eventually become president.
Leslie Knope,And to one day solve a murder on a train.
Leslie Knope,I think it's fair to add this to the list.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Justin's here!"
Leslie Knope,That's Justin.
Leslie Knope,Everybody start talking.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Justin,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Justin,Sorry I'm a little bit late.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my very interesting party.
Justin,Andy Dwyer!
Justin,Can't wait to catch up with this guy.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Justin."
Andy Dwyer,"May I take your coat, sir?"
Justin,"Why, yeah."
Justin,Thank you.
Justin,"I can't wait, I'm gonna get to hang out with all your friends tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I know, it's gonna be super fun."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a blast.
Leslie Knope,"Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life."
Leslie Knope,I cannot overhype it enough.
Justin,All right.
Justin,Let's get started!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, J?"
Justin,"How you doing, man?"
Justin,How are you?
Justin,Justin.
April Ludgate,I have the swine flu.
Justin,Oh--
Leslie Knope,"No, she doesn't."
April Ludgate,Yo.
Andy Dwyer,Yo.
April Ludgate,Is that Justin's coat?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Isn't it awesome?
Andy Dwyer,"He got it in Cambodia, when he was hiking Mount Everest."
April Ludgate,Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.
Andy Dwyer,That's genius.
Andy Dwyer,But I can't.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie's being super cool to me, and I can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket."
April Ludgate,I'll do it when you're not in the room then.
Andy Dwyer,That would be terrible.
Andy Dwyer,I'm being sarcastic.
Andy Dwyer,That would be awesome.
Justin,"God, India is so amazing."
Justin,Let me tell you something.
Justin,That is my absolute favorite place to travel.
Justin,Where did you say your parents were from?
Tom Haverford,The south part.
Leslie Knope,The southern part's always the best part of anything.
Justin,"Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?"
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,My uncle practically runs the place.
Tom Haverford,I've prayed there.
Tom Haverford,It's sick.
Justin,"Tell me everything, right now."
Tom Haverford,"One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say."
Tom Haverford,"The last time I was in India, I was eight years old and I stayed inside the whole time playing video games."
Tom Haverford,I got to bone up.
Tom Haverford,Fourth largest coal reserves in the world.
Ron Swanson,This is the best Old Fashioned I have ever had.
Ron Swanson,Where'd you find this bartender?
Leslie Knope,"Oh I think, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,"Like, maybe the Yellow Pages."
Ron Swanson,There's no way that you're paying him enough.
Bartender,"Well, if you want, I could teach you the secret to great--"
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get over here!"
Ann Perkins,I'm here.
Ann Perkins,Already.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, do you think this party's going well?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, can you see Justin?"
Leslie Knope,Is he having fun?
Ann Perkins,Justin is over there talking to Mark.
Ann Perkins,Happily.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good."
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna casually make my--
Mark Brendanawicz,"So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm dancing around, freaking out."
Mark Brendanawicz,I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.
Justin,Unreal!
Leslie Knope,Unreal!
Justin,"Oh, my God, that is unbelievable."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's... Isn't it, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Mark Brendanawicz,Didn't happen to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was a kid I knew from camp.
Mark Brendanawicz,But a great story's a great story.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted."
Leslie Knope,Dinner is served!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Wendy,Are we late?
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you doing?
Tom Haverford,How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?
Tom Haverford,He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.
Leslie Knope,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!"
Leslie Knope,I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.
Leslie Knope,Now's your chance!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!"
Tom Haverford,"Not cool, at all!"
Leslie Knope,He'll get over it.
Tom Haverford,"No, I won't."
Tania,The first course is a Mexican bean soup.
Ron Swanson,Are these peppers for consuming?
Tania,I wouldn't.
Tania,They're very hot.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna give it a try.
Ron Swanson,Hot.
Wendy,You're very brave.
Tom Haverford,"Please, that was one of the tiny ones."
Tom Haverford,This is how you eat it!
Ron Swanson,"Don't do that, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,"Mm, [bleep]."
Leslie Knope,"This is something, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Crazy stuff.
Leslie Knope,Discuss that.
April Ludgate,There's not much more to discuss.
April Ludgate,You kind of explained it all.
Leslie Knope,Who else is gay?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,There was a lull.
Leslie Knope,I saw Justin yawn.
Leslie Knope,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, focus!"
Leslie Knope,"God, you're no help."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me."
Leslie Knope,It won't affect my decision.
Leslie Knope,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, little buddy!"
Ron Swanson,Everything okay?
Ron Swanson,That took a long time.
Wendy,Poor Tommy.
Wendy,He has a very frail colon.
Justin,"I feel your pain, brother."
Justin,The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.
Leslie Knope,This sounds good.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve--
Leslie Knope,I wonder who that is.
Leslie Knope,Who could that be?
Justin,More people?
Leslie Knope,A belly dancer?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"It's weird, but she just showed up."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how they all got here.
Leslie Knope,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running."
Leslie Knope,"You don't do origami every day, do ya?"
Andy Dwyer,"They brought in a little entertainment, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,"That Justin, he's so boring."
Ben,What are you talking about? He's incredible.
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him."
Ben,"Yeah, I would understand."
Ben,"He's amazing, right, April?"
Andy Dwyer,"Right, April? Don't we love him?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,He's actually kind of awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You're underage.
Andy Dwyer,"I could lose my liquor license, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you having fun?
Justin,"All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting."
Justin,I cannot believe there's more.
Leslie Knope,There's not.
Barney,"Miss Knope, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers."
Ron Swanson,"You're doing what, Leslie?"
Barney,I demand an evaluation.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What course do you teach?
Barney,"When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste."
Barney,The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors--
Ron Swanson,"Well, this is great."
Ron Swanson,"I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore."
Ron Swanson,"My office, first thing tomorrow."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too."
Barney,The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, guys, please."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Phil,"I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night."
Phil,And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power.
Phil,Do you have anything to say before we begin?
Leslie Knope,Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.
Tom Haverford,I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain."
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record."
Phil,This has all been on the record.
Leslie Knope,I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.
Phil,Is Wendy one of the teachers?
Tom Haverford,"No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife."
Leslie Knope,And hopefully then-to-be future wife.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man child.
Tom Haverford,You're ruining it.
Leslie Knope,I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.
Tom Haverford,Totally uncalled for.
Phil,Ron Swanson will be next.
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one."
Ron Swanson,That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.
Phil,Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?
Ron Swanson,Would I have stayed if I knew that?
Phil,"I don't know, would you have?"
Ron Swanson,Would you have?
Phil,No.
Phil,I wouldn't have.
Phil,Did you hear Leslie make any promises?
Ron Swanson,What constitutes a promise?
Phil,A quid pro quo.
Ron Swanson,Oh! Do you know Latin?
Phil,Okay.
Phil,"Thank you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Are we done?
April Ludgate,Can I get a shine?
Andy Dwyer,Oh. No.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"We're closed, due to betrayment."
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,But I don't know what you're talking about.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you ask your new best friend, whose name is Justin."
April Ludgate,Justin?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,I would.
April Ludgate,But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,Unbetrayed.
Phil,"So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center?"
Justin,No.
Phil,I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.
Phil,"Why is he here, Miss Knope?"
Leslie Knope,That will become clear.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Anderson, could you please describe that evening?"
Justin,"Well, I had a very pleasant time."
Justin,"And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests."
Leslie Knope,"Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath."
Justin,I had an amazing time.
Leslie Knope,But you fell asleep.
Justin,"Oh, God."
Justin,I'm so sorry.
Justin,"You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel."
Leslie Knope,You should've told me.
Leslie Knope,I would've rescheduled.
Justin,Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to it.
Justin,I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers.
Leslie Knope,No further questions.
Phil,Okay.
Phil,"We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour."
Justin,Great.
Justin,I will see you later.
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now."
Justin,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"But, yes, yes, you will."
Leslie Knope,"So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend."
Leslie Knope,There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,You're so relaxed.
Ann Perkins,You're not freaking out about this at all?
Phil,"Okay, Leslie."
Phil,We've reached our decision.
Phil,We're not going to take any further action at this time.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Phil,It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself.
Phil,And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket.
Phil,But I think we both know you skirted a line here.
Ann Perkins,You turned yourself in? Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad."
Leslie Knope,"So, this morning I donated 1,000 dollars to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so why did you ask for the hearing?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you kidding, Ann? It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury."
Leslie Knope,I'm not proud of my actions.
Leslie Knope,"But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass."
Justin,Tommy Hav.
Tom Haverford,J Train!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, brother?"
Justin,"This might be none of my business, but you need to ask Wendy out."
Justin,"For reals, this time."
Tom Haverford,Did Leslie tell you--
Justin,No.
Justin,She didn't need to.
Justin,I saw it.
Tom Haverford,"I'm not gay, but you're the most incredible man I've ever met."
Justin,That doesn't sound gay at all.
Justin,See you around.
Tom Haverford,Take care.
Justin,"Bye, brother."
Tom Haverford,You sure you don't want to come hang out for a minute?
