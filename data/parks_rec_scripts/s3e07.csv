Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,And I am so proud of all of you.
Leslie Knope,You've worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have a surprise."
Leslie Knope,"And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the world famous Little Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Tom Haverford,No way!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I never thought I'd get to meet him.
Tom Haverford,It's really him.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Well done!
Leslie Knope,"Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,That week he was the eighth most photographed object in America.
Leslie Knope,"So suck it, the Alamo."
Ben Wyatt,"So, what am I missing?"
Ben Wyatt,What's the deal with this pony?
Tom Haverford,"He's not a pony, Ben."
Tom Haverford,He's a mini-horse.
Tom Haverford,There's a big difference.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, why is he so famous?"
Ben Wyatt,Does he do something?
Ben Wyatt,What does he do?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he does being a mini-horse, and he does it better than anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Son, this horse has an honorary degree from Notre Dame."
Leslie Knope,We all need to be very careful.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Remember.
Leslie Knope,This little guy is 25 now.
Leslie Knope,And he has cataracts in both eyes.
Leslie Knope,He has severe arthritis.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's going to look after him.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I am."
Jerry Gergich,We are both on the same diabetes medication.
Jerry Gergich,Are you my Glucotrol buddy?
Jerry Gergich,Are you?
Leslie Knope,Isn't it amazing?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I've just got to be honest.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what the big deal is.
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Tanya,"Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here?"
Leslie Knope,On Deep Fried Boulevard?
Tanya,It's just-- There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we want to make money, not make people hate themselves."
Tanya,Salad's are my life.
Leslie Knope,"Of course, I'm sorry, you know what we'll do, we'll make Sue's Salads the official healthy choice of the festival."
Tanya,"Well that's great, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, nobody's going to come to your stupid booth anyway."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
Leslie Knope,"And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated."
Leslie Knope,That's why we're going big.
Leslie Knope,"Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000 plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks."
Leslie Knope,"God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing."
Leslie Knope,Clowns.
Leslie Knope,"No you cannot sell home-brewed water, and no I would not like to taste it."
Leslie Knope,"April, who's next?"
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just knocking these off."
Ben Wyatt,You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.
Tom Haverford,You're like a nerd mixed with a dork or something.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Leslie Knope,"No, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Ben Wyatt,It's not.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone has seen it.
Leslie Knope,Everyone has seen it.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone.
April Ludgate,This guy's here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ken."
Ken Hotate,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is Ben and Tom.
Tom Haverford,That's a dope bolo.
Leslie Knope,This is Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Leslie Knope,"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums."
Leslie Knope,The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,And just let me say that we really tried.
Ken Hotate,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one."
Ken Hotate,I'm under a lot of pressure.
Ken Hotate,I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons."
Ken Hotate,"During the battle, 93 year old chief was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry."
Tom Haverford,Did he die?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ken Hotate,And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive."
Leslie Knope,This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
Leslie Knope,The atrocities are in blue.
Leslie Knope,"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent."
Ken Hotate,"I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground."
Ken Hotate,And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.
Ken Hotate,There are two things I know about white people.
Ken Hotate,"They love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines."
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,"Ow, ow, ow!"
Ben Wyatt,Right in the chest.
Ben Wyatt,Bazooka.
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, get a room."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so guys, focus up."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything needs to be perfect."
Leslie Knope,Joan is always looking for a scandal.
Leslie Knope,She's like an eagleeyed tiger.
Andy Dwyer,Eagle Eyed Tiger.
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Let's grab hands.
Ron Swanson,I don't hold hands.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You're all amazing, wonderful people."
Leslie Knope,"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs."
Ben Wyatt,That's not inspiring.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go get them, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Any concerns, address them to Ron."
Ron Swanson,"The advantages to being Leslie's boss is that she does everything herself, and there are never any problems."
Ron Swanson,"Which means for the next week, I can sit in this lawn chair, and read this book about old boats. Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?"
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,"He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it."
Donna Meagle,I've done that to multiple men.
Donna Meagle,How are you doing?
Donna Meagle,Are you doing okay?
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for asking.
Ann Perkins,It's been tough.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave."
Ann Perkins,I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.
Ann Perkins,Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.
Ann Perkins,I did this to my hair.
Ann Perkins,"You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,"Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems."
Donna Meagle,I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.
Ann Perkins,That's what my mailman said.
Joan Callamezzo,Murder.
Joan Callamezzo,Murder the most melons.
Joan Callamezzo,Shaquille showered.
Joan Callamezzo,Shame on Shakira's sheets.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Joan."
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, Leslie."
Joan Callamezzo,Looks like a very impressive festival.
Joan Callamezzo,But we'll see.
Joan Callamezzo,We'll see.
Leslie Knope,You remember Ben.
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,It's nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival."
Leslie Knope,And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Joan Callamezzo,Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee corn.
Leslie Knope,And it's organic.
Leslie Knope,"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel."
Joan Callamezzo,"Beautiful, but deadly."
Joan Callamezzo,When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is 100% up to code."
Joan Callamezzo,How many of these carnies are illegals?
Leslie Knope,None.
Leslie Knope,They're all U.S citizens.
Leslie Knope,"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday."
Joan Callamezzo,You got Tilda?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We got Tilda.
Leslie Knope,But the real coup is over there.
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Joan Callamezzo,Are you [bleep] kidding me?
Joan Callamezzo,You got Little Sebastian?
Leslie Knope,See for yourself.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,He is so adorable.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Joan."
Tom Haverford,"And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either!"
Joan Callamezzo,Tom!
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Joan Callamezzo,Good.
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Tom Haverford,Hold on a second.
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Tom Haverford,Did you get your breasts done?
Tom Haverford,You look amazing.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, thanks for noticing."
Tom Haverford,"Joan, listen to me."
Tom Haverford,"This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off."
Tom Haverford,"And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage."
Tom Haverford,To completion.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Andy Dwyer,I swear.
Andy Dwyer,It's almost like they don't want you to win.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you better practice."
April Ludgate,You've got to win me a teddy bear.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.
April Ludgate,"Well, I want a billion teddy bears."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's a little unrealistic."
Andy Dwyer,This is a hard game.
Andy Dwyer,Two million.
April Ludgate,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
April Ludgate,"Hey, I love you."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, shut up!"
Andy Dwyer,That is awesome sauce.
Jerry Gergich,You're such a good boy.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.
Jerry Gergich,Perfect.
Jerry Gergich,I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.
Tom Haverford,"Hi Little Sebastian, how's it going?"
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, just eating some hay, hanging out. What's your name?"
Tom Haverford,My name's Tom. Oh you're really well-dressed.
Tom Haverford,"I like how you have your t-shirt over your dress shirt, you look way cooler than everybody else here."
Tom Haverford,"Little Sebastian come on, you're making me blush."
Tom Haverford,Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous minihorse.
Tom Haverford,"I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,That is a shockingly huge minihorse erection.
Joan Callamezzo,"I don't think I'm being unprofessional, I was really hoping for more tawdry scandals."
Joan Callamezzo,"What about your friend Ben, here?"
Joan Callamezzo,We all know his story.
Joan Callamezzo,"One of failure, remind us of that failure."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know, when I was an 18 year old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city."
Joan Callamezzo,Yikes.
Ben Wyatt,I was also shortstop of my J.V baseball team.
Ben Wyatt,No one ever brings that up.
Joan Callamezzo,"And now, you're involved with this."
Joan Callamezzo,"Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness."
Leslie Knope,Not even I could screw that up.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm a reporter, not your therapist."
Tom Haverford,"So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it."
Tom Haverford,Am I a genius or what?
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Where's Little Sebastian?
Tom Haverford,"Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,What are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,Unbelievable.
Tom Haverford,Another in a long string of miserable failures.
Tom Haverford,You lost Little Sebastian!
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't even here!
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,"Hopefully I can get you out this mess, that you and no one else caused."
Jerry Gergich,You were the one watching him.
Tom Haverford,It's a poor workman that blames his tools.
Tom Haverford,You look for him.
Tom Haverford,I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.
Joan Callamezzo,The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m tomorrow morning.
Joan Callamezzo,"And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time."
Leslie Knope,"Come on down, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's going to be sweet.
Joan Callamezzo,"It pains me to say this, but great job here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That went well.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It did.
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Joan Callamezzo,Sorry?
Joan Callamezzo,What is this about a curse?
Joan Callamezzo,Curse?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Did you Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,It's Little Sebastian.
Tom Haverford,He's gone.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is."
Joan Callamezzo,Keep those cameras up.
Joan Callamezzo,We've got a new intro to do.
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's go ahead.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.
Joan Callamezzo,How about some of those spooky traffic lights?
Joan Callamezzo,"Okay, you know the drill."
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,Is it revenge of the Wamapoke?
Joan Callamezzo,An incompetent government run amok?
Joan Callamezzo,Or probably something even worse than any of those things?
Joan Callamezzo,"While it seemed everything was ready for tomorrow, things aren't always exactly as they may seem."
Ben Wyatt,"This is bad, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes this is bad.
Leslie Knope,This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, gross, but we can handle a little bad publicity."
Leslie Knope,This is way worse than that.
Leslie Knope,"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod."
Leslie Knope,"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy."
Leslie Knope,Double lightning rod.
Ben Wyatt,"Plus, we lost that little pony."
Leslie Knope,It's a mini-horse.
Leslie Knope,And that's the third lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,Triple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you have the curse."
Leslie Knope,Quadruple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,It's a classic four-rod distaster.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh right, one of those."
Leslie Knope,"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?"
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch."
Leslie Knope,The year was 1973.
Jerry Gergich,We are really up a creek here.
Jerry Gergich,What the heck are we going to do?
Tom Haverford,You mean what are you gonna do?
Jerry Gergich,"No, what are do gonna you?"
Tom Haverford,What am do gonna I? That's a great question Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Can you believe we left Little Sebastian with the gentleman?
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you were the one watching him."
Ron Swanson,"Okay apparently I'm gonna get any work done, how did this happen?"
April Ludgate,Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.
Andy Dwyer,That's not bad.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot."
Tom Haverford,I don't want to go with Jerry.
Tom Haverford,He's the one who deliberated caused me to accidentally let the horse out.
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Jerry Gergich,Stop it.
Ron Swanson,Hang on. All of you listen to me.
Ron Swanson,That magnificent little horse is lost and he's probably scared and it's our fault.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, you get along."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, April, check the corn maze."
Andy Dwyer,Good idea.
Andy Dwyer,Horses love mazes.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie?"
Ann Perkins,"This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse."
Leslie Knope,No comment.
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""No comment""?"
Leslie Knope,"You've got to say ""No comment."""
Ann Perkins,I did.
Leslie Knope,"Good, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Run, Ann, run!"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,You've got to see this.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ken Hotate,Thank you for having me.
Ken Hotate,"The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site."
Perd Hapley,Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist?
Ken Hotate,Exactly.
Ken Hotate,I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.
Perd Hapley,We do have exclusive animation of that event.
Perd Hapley,Let's take a look.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I love these things."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Perd Hapley,Is that what happened?
Leslie Knope,None of that happened.
Ken Hotate,That is exactly what happened.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
Leslie Knope,That seems to be their biggest problem.
Leslie Knope,Maybe that will make them happy.
Perd Hapley,"Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage."
Andy Dwyer,You know where I would hide if I was horse. The merry-go-round. Think about it.
Andy Dwyer,You just stand still next to the other horses and no one would ever know.
Andy Dwyer,It's the perfect crime.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I'm going to go look by myself.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, are you alright?"
Andy Dwyer,You seem super not happy.
April Ludgate,I'm fine.
April Ludgate,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow."
April Ludgate,Forever.
Andy Dwyer,You're not fine.
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, I can read you like the back of a book. something is upsetting you."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?
April Ludgate,I'm not upset.
April Ludgate,"I'm great, see."
April Ludgate,I'm not mad at Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy's great.
April Ludgate,I awesome sauce Andy.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,This maze is like a maze.
Ann Perkins,Left.
Ann Perkins,Look right.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, okay."
Extra,"I don't know what's sicker, me or your body."
Ann Perkins,You aren't sick.
Extra,Maybe you should check out my abs.
Ann Perkins,Are you experiencing abdominal pain?
Extra,Every day at the gym.
Ann Perkins,Eww.
Extra,Feel.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Extra,What are you doing tonight?
Ann Perkins,I'm prepping the medical tent.
Ann Perkins,I think I'm going to have to pass.
Extra,Your loss.
Donna Meagle,Are you going to hit that?
Ann Perkins,Him?
Ann Perkins,He isn't exactly boyfriend material.
Donna Meagle,Who said anything about a boyfriend?
Donna Meagle,Use him.
Donna Meagle,Abuse him.
Donna Meagle,Lose him.
Donna Meagle,That's the Meagle motto.
Donna Meagle,Grammy Meagle taught me that.
Donna Meagle,"She died at the age of 84, sandwiched between two 30 year olds."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, hey, hey."
Jerry Gergich,Did you find him?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry."
April Ludgate,He's right here in my pocket.
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, he can't have gone that far. He's got the legs of Tom, the endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Ground mission failed.
Ron Swanson,We need a bird's eye view.
Andy Dwyer,You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?
Ben Wyatt,"We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Extra,Wow.
Extra,"First, Ice Town."
Extra,"Now, this."
Extra,"Bad luck really follows you around, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, we have plenty of food."
Leslie Knope,There is no food shortage.
Leslie Knope,"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival."
Leslie Knope,"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals."""
Tom Haverford,"You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I'm only going to say this once."
Andy Dwyer,What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?
April Ludgate,How about you only say that never?
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?"
Leslie Knope,It will not be a disaster.
Leslie Knope,It will be a success.
Leslie Knope,"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request."
Leslie Knope,"So, yes, Perd."
Perd Hapley,"Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question."
Perd Hapley,Will that be enough to lift the curse?
Leslie Knope,"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a spatula.
Joan Callamezzo,It's the curse.
Joan Callamezzo,That's exactly what it is.
Joan Callamezzo,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Please, we'll get this up and running in no time."
Tom Haverford,"Well Jerry, what the hell?"
Jerry Gergich,I didn't do this.
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Leslie Knope,We cannot catch a break.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, well, I'll help you out."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I'm jinxed or something.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you were totally fine until I got involved."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I feel like I should probably just go."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm the curse, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm going to get out of here."
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Jerry Gergich,"When they're missing this long, they're usually dead."
Tom Haverford,"Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town."
Tom Haverford,And God.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"You were the one who let him out, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, stop trying to blame me."
April Ludgate,"Jerry, can you please be quiet?"
April Ludgate,I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me?"
April Ludgate,"Ron, can you please tell Andy"
Ron Swanson,"All of you, be quiet."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, she's mad because you said ""awesome sauce"" instead of ""I love you, too."""
Ron Swanson,"April, he loves you."
Ron Swanson,Stop being a child.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, you're clearly at fault here."
Ron Swanson,Blaming Jerry won't save you.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian."
Ron Swanson,"So, everyone apologize to everyone else."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Tom."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,I do love you.
April Ludgate,You do?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome."
Tom Haverford,Jerry just farted.
Jerry Gergich,I'm very upset.
Jerry Gergich,I get nervous.
Ed,"Hey, Leslie?"
Ed,Generator's shot.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Ed,Wow.
Ed,You know your stuff.
Ed,You single?
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ed."
Leslie Knope,How could that happen?
Extra,All those TV crews plugged in and overloaded it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it. Stupid media.
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you something, freedom of press is for the birds."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now?"
Extra,There's only one place in town that has a generator that size.
Leslie Knope,You've got to be kidding me.
Leslie Knope,This festival was supposed to be my love letter to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Now it's just turned into a note that say I want to see other people.
Ken Hotate,"So, you need to borrow our generator?"
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke--"
Leslie Knope,"A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but this is not a trick."
Leslie Knope,"I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun."
Ken Hotate,"Now, that's interesting."
Extra,It's been really awesome looking at you.
Extra,Most carnival nurses are total grenades.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you're all set."
Ann Perkins,You are free to go.
Ann Perkins,Or you could stay here and make out with me until the lights come back on.
Extra,"Hell, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Beat it, Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Aye-aye, Captain."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs."
Leslie Knope,Can you help me out here?
Ken Hotate,A Native American tribe making a deal with the government. What could go wrong?
Ken Hotate,"You can have the generator, Leslie."
