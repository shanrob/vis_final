Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What the hell is this?
Ron Swanson,I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I am rage glowing."
Leslie Knope,"Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?"
Leslie Knope,What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?
Leslie Knope,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut."
Leslie Knope,"Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders."
Ron Swanson,I believe in cutting useless government projects.
Ron Swanson,"I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects."
Ron Swanson,The Hoover Dam is a travesty.
Leslie Knope,You also believe in making furniture.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?
Ron Swanson,Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?
Ron Swanson,"Look, the defunding of the minigolf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win."
Leslie Knope,"That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.
Ron Swanson,How?
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,It already has windmills.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I know."
Councilman Milton,I feel very ill.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute."
Leslie Knope,I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.
Councilman Milton,"Well, the last time I was there, I saw kids of all races getting along and playing."
Councilman Milton,It was terrible.
Councilman Milton,So I'm voting to get rid of it.
Leslie Knope,At least you have a good reason.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Howser is with me."
Leslie Knope,Milton is with Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs."
Jeremy Jamm,"On the other hand, minigolf rules."
Jeremy Jamm,"And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,So this one could go either way.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm kind of a badass wild card.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
Jeremy Jamm,More like who am I doing?
Jeremy Jamm,No one.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm free.
Jeremy Jamm,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,"Can I get two beers and an ice water for my friend here, designated driver?"
Ben Wyatt,I am?
Ben Wyatt,You drove here.
Andy Dwyer,"Nah, it's too late, bro."
Andy Dwyer,I already ordered the water.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what you want me to do.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink."
Ben Wyatt,And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.
Ben Wyatt,And paying for everyone.
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't get to choose the bar.
Ben Wyatt,I should be more assertive.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, the band is moving me tonight."
Andy Dwyer,It's really good.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,They sound kinda crappy to me.
April Ludgate,"Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot."
April Ludgate,"Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song."
Burly,"Spread your wings and fly, yeah"
Andy Dwyer,That's my band.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't recognize us without me because I'm the only one that matters.
Burly,"Thank you, everyone."
Burly,We are Rat Mouse.
Andy Dwyer,Rat Mouse?
Andy Dwyer,Rat bastards.
Andy Dwyer,They're playing without me?
Andy Dwyer,That's a song I wrote!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, baby, can I borrow your car for a month?"
Tom Haverford,I already lent you my car.
Tom Haverford,Do you not know where my car is?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ugh, I'm so sick of the third degree."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's like dating a cop.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm gassy.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's make out.
Tom Haverford,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Move aside!
Tom Haverford,Dating MonaLisa is awesome.
Tom Haverford,Except that I live in constant fear for my life.
Tom Haverford,So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Perkins, sit down."
Tom Haverford,I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's funny, right?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're already planning on having a baby together."
Ann Perkins,We're not quite a couple but
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Congrats.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I need your help."
Tom Haverford,My girlfriend is crazy.
Ann Perkins,You say that about every girl you date.
Ann Perkins,You said that about me.
Tom Haverford,"Calm down, Ann."
Tom Haverford,You're proving my point.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, MonaLisa is legit insane."
Tom Haverford,She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.
Tom Haverford,Can you break up with her for me?
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.
Tom Haverford,I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine you love so much.
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie."
Tom Haverford,Won't you do it for free?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, dead ringer for Courtney ThorneSmith."
Jeremy Jamm,She works at the gas station.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet."
Leslie Knope,I need you to stay upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Keep things light.
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,I can be a sort of Conversational lubricant.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure."
Chris Traeger,I love being a caddy.
Chris Traeger,It's so much more than just carrying clubs.
Chris Traeger,It's about offering positive reinforcement.
Chris Traeger,I consider myself a caddy to everyone in my life.
Extra,"Yeah, good one!"
Chris Traeger,Nice shot!
Chris Traeger,Great sweeping.
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, duck."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, nice putter."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, thank you very much."
Jeremy Jamm,Some fat Hawaiian guy left it in my waiting room.
Jeremy Jamm,"When he came back, I was all like, ""Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it."""
Jeremy Jamm,I don't know.
Jeremy Jamm,Classic.
Leslie Knope,What a great and funny story.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hot dogs?
Jeremy Jamm,"You know I have irritable bowel syndrome, you racist."
Leslie Knope,"Yikes, okay."
Leslie Knope,How about a snow cone on me?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Leslie, snow cone lady."
Ron Swanson,I see you're about to play a round of publicly subsidized minigolf.
Ron Swanson,Mind if I join you?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hello, Burly, Chang."
Burly,"Hey, man, what's up?"
Andy Dwyer,"I was just over at the bar, enjoying a wonderful night with my coworkers who all talked about how awesome I was, and I look up, and what do I see?"
Andy Dwyer,A band.
Andy Dwyer,"But you're missing something like, uh, I don't know, your lead singer songwriter Tshirt designer nacho chef."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Burly,"First of all, your nachos are terrible."
Burly,No one's had the guts to tell you.
Burly,Why don't you melt the cheese?
Chang,"We tried to tell you about the show, man."
Chang,"I called your cell, like, 20 times."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot."
Andy Dwyer,"You bothered to call me, you'd have known that."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.
Burly,"That's a pretty good name, actually."
Chang,"Yeah, he's really good at coming up with names."
Jeremy Jamm,Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.
Jeremy Jamm,You guys got Black Crown here?
Jeremy Jamm,"If not, you should."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, are you gonna be joining us?"
Ron Swanson,I won't be playing.
Ron Swanson,I'm simply here to remind Councilman Jamm that this ridiculous play palace costs the taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.
Leslie Knope,And what a bargain.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it."
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves it.
Leslie Knope,It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, she's right, Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,I do love it.
Jeremy Jamm,You should relax a little.
Jeremy Jamm,Have a snow cone.
Jeremy Jamm,Leslie's buying all night.
Ron Swanson,You don't say.
Ron Swanson,"She's buying you snow cones, and tomorrow you're voting on an issue that she cares about."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?"
Leslie Knope,Game on.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, everybody, great news."
Chris Traeger,They gave us free mylar balloons.
Jeremy Jamm,I got dibs on the dinosaur.
Jeremy Jamm,And the pirate and the dolphin.
Jeremy Jamm,I want all of 'em.
Leslie Knope,You got 'em.
Jeremy Jamm,Sweet.
Chris Traeger,The Councilman is away Good luck to you both.
Jeremy Jamm,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Chris."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I could be a pro!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,Having fun?
Jeremy Jamm,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.
Ron Swanson,"It's also a place that costs the taxpayer 9,000 dollars in annual subsidies."
Jeremy Jamm,You guys sound like school.
Chris Traeger,I have two important pieces of caddy information.
Chris Traeger,"Councilman Jamm leads by eight strokes, and you are both about to set a course record."
Chris Traeger,For friendship.
Chris Traeger,On to the next hole.
Ron Swanson,You are pandering to get a vote.
Ron Swanson,"And worse, you're deliberately losing."
Leslie Knope,I am not deliberately losing.
Leslie Knope,I'm having a very off night.
Ron Swanson,Losing on purpose is a form of lying.
Ron Swanson,You're only as good as your word.
Leslie Knope,"You want a word, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,I have a word for you.
Leslie Knope,"I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community stop!"
Leslie Knope,I know it's more than one word.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Extra,Remember
Ann Perkins,"Hi, MonaLisa?"
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,I used to date Tom.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, okay."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"We can do this, but I will bite you."
Ann Perkins,"Is that a screwdrive no, I do not want to fight."
Ann Perkins,No.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I just wanna talk to you woman to woman because I know Tom pretty well.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Do you know his ATM pin?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,'Cause I cannot crack that little bitch's code.
Ann Perkins,I don't.
Ann Perkins,You know what used to drive me nuts?
Ann Perkins,He is a total control freak.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you have to put a coaster down on every surface, and the worst part is, they're all made out of pictures from Diddy's Instagram."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Diddy's on Instagram?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"How did I not know that Diddy was on Instagram, you jagweeds?"
Ann Perkins,Who are you yelling at?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,The jagweeds.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Why are you still in front of me?
Burly,Everything that used to
Andy Dwyer,I'm done with that band.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm an adult now, you know?"
Andy Dwyer,I work two parttime jobs.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I don't need the stress of playing guitar with my friends every few weeks.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, plus look how bad they are without you."
April Ludgate,Burly's terrible.
Andy Dwyer,He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.
April Ludgate,"Right, that's what I meant."
April Ludgate,"I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing."
April Ludgate,"I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s."
April Ludgate,And Bette Midler.
April Ludgate,Obviously.
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, I'm retiring from music."
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"But not without first a monster farewell performance solo on this stage tonight, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,I'ma show these idiots what a big mistake they made.
Andy Dwyer,"I need piece of paper, I need a pen, I need four more beers, I need a computer fan, I need a lightning bolt of inspiration."
Andy Dwyer,It's song writing time.
Ben Wyatt,What do you need a computer fan for?
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when you use a computer, it gets hot, and the fan cools it down."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think it's great that you're cool with Tom's financial situation."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What are you talking about?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Tommy owns his own business.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but he had to borrow a lot of money, and when you're not around, Tom drinks tap water."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Excuse me.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You're broke?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yeah, super broke."
Tom Haverford,Are you upset about that?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm, yeah, 'cause I don't eff with poorsies."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"But thanks to a warning from my new best friend, I don't have to, okay?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"We're done, you're awesome, and I don't even usually like Puerto Rican chicks."
Ann Perkins,"I'm not I mean, it shouldn't matter, but I'm"
Tom Haverford,You're breaking up with me?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man, that sucks."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,That's right.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's over.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's go dance.
Ann Perkins,Help.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, I cannot catch a break."
Jeremy Jamm,"You better find your stroke, Knope."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I'm gonna let Julie go home."
Chris Traeger,"It's getting late, and Jeremy's eaten all the syrup."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,It's been an honor working alongside you.
Extra,Thanks.
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,Hold up.
Jeremy Jamm,Snow cones are half the fun.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?"
Extra,I have calculus homework.
Leslie Knope,"I Oh, well, math is worthless in real life."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's an app for calculating tips."
Leslie Knope,That's all you need.
Leslie Knope,"Math is very important, especially for young women."
Leslie Knope,Stay in school.
Ron Swanson,I've made my point.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has made hers.
Ron Swanson,"Which way are you voting, Councilman?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the fence about this budget thing, but I do love watching you guys squabble over me."
Jeremy Jamm,You sure make a guy feel like a real lady.
Leslie Knope,Weird.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, how about this?"
Jeremy Jamm,You two play each other.
Jeremy Jamm,Nine holes.
Jeremy Jamm,Winner gets my vote.
Leslie Knope,I'm game.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,An athletic competition where both parties are competing their hardest is certainly more honorable than whatever this charade is.
Chris Traeger,Sudden death playoff on the very course that hangs in the balance.
Chris Traeger,I could literally faint if I didn't have impeccable blood pressure.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,My name is Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,You probably know me as the artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, after tonight, you'll only know me as the former artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,I'm retiring from music.
Andy Dwyer,This is my swan song.
Andy Dwyer,Once I was a golden swan swan of a man now that swan's name was Andy and he started a rock and roll band
Andy Dwyer,he made incredible nachos that everybody claimed they loved and then the band mates dicked him over
Andy Dwyer,with a massive rock and roll shove this is my swan song watch me fly
Ann Perkins,Tom.
Tom Haverford,What happened to you?
Ann Perkins,MonaLisa happened to me.
Ann Perkins,She covered me in glitter and Anna Nicole body spray.
Ann Perkins,Why do they still even make that?
Tom Haverford,They don't she's had the same bottle for years.
Tom Haverford,She just mixes in water and baby oil.
Ann Perkins,"Now it's your turn to help me, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You need to break things off with me and MonaLisa.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Ann, this might be a battle you need to fight yourself."
Tom Haverford,I try not to get involved in other people's personal relationships.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,Don't hurt me.
Ann Perkins,Get me out of this friendship!
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna find a place where I can be the beautiful duckling I always was inside whoa whoa whoa
Ron Swanson,Why is there a gorilla guarding this gingerbread house?
Leslie Knope,Because minigolf is awesome.
Leslie Knope,"It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved."
Jeremy Jamm,Less talk.
Jeremy Jamm,More competing for my vote.
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Chris Traeger,This is it.
Chris Traeger,Ron leads by one.
Chris Traeger,"If he hits the ball into the dragon's mouth, he gets Jamm's vote."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, bean sprouts."
Leslie Knope,Tofu.
Leslie Knope,Ralph Nader.
Leslie Knope,Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.
Leslie Knope,"Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up."
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Chris Traeger,Hole in one!
Chris Traeger,"Excellent win, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"Even better loss, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses."
Jeremy Jamm,"Swanson, I hate you."
Jeremy Jamm,Nothing will change that.
Jeremy Jamm,But I respect the hell out of your short game.
Jeremy Jamm,"You got my vote, hombre."
Extra,"Hey, you got a hole in one on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this."
Leslie Knope,"No, he gets the dragon too?"
Ron Swanson,A fine trophy.
Ron Swanson,I think I'll keep it in the office.
Leslie Knope,"No, you won't."
Leslie Knope,"Here, kid, want this, huh?"
Extra,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Take it and run.
Leslie Knope,Run!
Ann Perkins,"Tom, she's coming!"
Ann Perkins,Tom!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, desperation time."
Tom Haverford,Follow my lead.
Ann Perkins,What lead?
Ann Perkins,What do you mean?
Ann Perkins,What are you oh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"What the mothereffing, cing essing, effing king eff is going on right now?"
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, MonaLisa."
Tom Haverford,We can't keep our hands off each other.
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, it's all finally very clear."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All the times that you were like, ""Oh, no, Tom's no good for you."""
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,And all the times you tried to break it off with me I finally get it.
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You guys want a threesome.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,We do not wanna have a threesome with you.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let's not rush to judgment."
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I say we hear her out."
Ann Perkins,Gross.
Ann Perkins,"Tom, good luck."
Ann Perkins,You still owe me a blanket.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"She's got a screw loose, am I right?"
Tom Haverford,Actually she's not the one in my life I would call crazy.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I still don't think we should date."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, me neither."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I've been single for an hour now, and it's the tits!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'd still like to hook up though.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yo, do you wanna have a threesome with us?"

Andy Dwyer,"Well, hello, fellow employees."
Andy Dwyer,"Coworkers, I bid you adieu."
Donna Meagle,"Whoa, fancy Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, me?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,This is just how I dress now.
Andy Dwyer,Funny goofball music Andy is gone.
Andy Dwyer,You're left with the professional remains.
Andy Dwyer,I'm an adult now.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna focus on business, which is good."
Andy Dwyer,Give me more time to play video games.
April Ludgate,"Babe, you love that band that I also love so much."
April Ludgate,They're important to you.
April Ludgate,"Come on, call Burly and ask him to let you back in."
Andy Dwyer,"Why, so they can steal my swan song?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, joke's on them."
Andy Dwyer,I forgot it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, business is my life now."
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's in there?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Iit's locked.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's my briefcase."
Andy Dwyer,Is it?
Ron Swanson,Good gravy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I believe you know this gorilla.
Leslie Knope,"It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died."
Leslie Knope,Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.
Ron Swanson,How much did you pay for this?
Leslie Knope,Irrelevant.
Leslie Knope,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them."
Leslie Knope,"Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way."
Leslie Knope,"You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,Those principles stink.
Leslie Knope,They're not the right principles.
Ron Swanson,You may think so.
Ron Swanson,I do not.
Ron Swanson,Thank you for my new silver-backed friend.
Ron Swanson,I like him very much.
Ron Swanson,"I will call him ""9,000 dollars of taxpayer money the gorilla."""
Leslie Knope,That is a terrible-- his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How did your wild dirtbag fantasy night work out?
Tom Haverford,"Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot."
Tom Haverford,"Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield."
Tom Haverford,"She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, ""Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant."""
Tom Haverford,She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking Goldschlager at a gas station.
Ann Perkins,You have to break up with her.
Tom Haverford,I tried.
Tom Haverford,Again.
Tom Haverford,It did not go well.
Ann Perkins,Did she assault you?
Tom Haverford,"No, this was a sexual injury."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, gross."
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, here's your chenille blanket."
Tom Haverford,You earned it.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for your help.
Ann Perkins,"Tom, thank you."
Tom Haverford,"Eh, be nice to Chenille O'Neal."
Ann Perkins,I will.
Tom Haverford,It needs to be brushed regularly.
Tom Haverford,Never use a lint roller.
Tom Haverford,I'm dead serious.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Tom Haverford,And keep it out of direct sunlight.
Tom Haverford,"If I see this at one picnic, I swear--"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what, I don't even want it anymore."
Tom Haverford,Yes! Thank you!
Jeremy Jamm,"What's up, yellow head?"
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I was, but it doesn't have to go down that way."
Leslie Knope,You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt.
Jeremy Jamm,My word is garbage.
Jeremy Jamm,Everyone knows that.
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk deal.
Jeremy Jamm,What can you offer me to change my mind?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, don't act so shocked."
Jeremy Jamm,"A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill."
Jeremy Jamm,Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones.
Jeremy Jamm,This is simply how people like us operate.
Leslie Knope,I have six things to say to you.
Leslie Knope,One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.
Leslie Knope,"Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded."
Leslie Knope,"And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word."
Leslie Knope,Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.
Leslie Knope,Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.
Leslie Knope,'Twas Leslie killed the beast.
Leslie Knope,"Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass."
Leslie Knope,"And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change."
Ron Swanson,You want a drink?
Leslie Knope,Very much.
Andy Dwyer,"Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, I love playing with you guys."
Andy Dwyer,And I want back in if you'll let me.
Burly,"Well, we never wanted to kick you out."
Burly,"It's just, you didn't show up for practice, and we like to play."
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Burly,"If you wanna come back in, you can."
Burly,I'm more of a backup singer anyways.
April Ludgate,You can say that again.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you got a great voice."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Ben! God, don't say that."
Burly,"Welcome back, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,#NAME?
Andy Dwyer,"All right! Hey, I'll even try melting the cheese on the nachos."
Burly,All right.
Andy Dwyer,It won't work.
Andy Dwyer,You're gonna look like such an idiot.
Leslie Knope,"I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done."
Leslie Knope,"But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy."
Ron Swanson,You're in politics.
Ron Swanson,What did you expect?
