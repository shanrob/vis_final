Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Look in your folders.
Leslie Knope,You will find information about founder's week.
Leslie Knope,"And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin."
Ron Swanson,Lending?
Ron Swanson,Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.
Ron Swanson,I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"We've got a pie eating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade."
Leslie Knope,"I don't wanna overhype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turds on wheels convention."
Leslie Knope,Let's do an exercise.
Leslie Knope,"April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?"
April Ludgate,Easy: Most murders per capita.
April Ludgate,The guillotine was invented here.
April Ludgate,City Hall is run by the walrus mafia.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, help me out."
Leslie Knope,What makes Pawnee so great?
Donna Meagle,Cost of living is cheap.
Donna Meagle,"In about three years, I will have saved enough to pay off my condo in Seattle."
Ben Wyatt,You have a condo in Seattle?
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I like the rain and the fish markets."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,"I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?"
Leslie Knope,No more distractions.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm bored.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's go have sex in a tree.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,He'll be back in eight minutes.
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to bring her here?
Tom Haverford,I don't really have any power in this relationship.
Tom Haverford,I'll think of ideas in the tree.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Anyone's welcome to join us in the tree!
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Donna Meagle,You okay?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, colleagues, coworkers, friends."
Andy Dwyer,Everyone feeling normal today?
Andy Dwyer,Here's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,I left my sweat shirt at Ron's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,"When I went back to get it, I found this in the trash: Positive pregnancy test."
Andy Dwyer,Side note: I accidentally threw my sweat shirt away.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I was digging through the trash.
Andy Dwyer,Found that too.
Andy Dwyer,Pretty cool.
Andy Dwyer,"So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin Leslie, Donna, Ann, MonaLisa, or April is pregnant!"
Andy Dwyer,Can't be April.
Andy Dwyer,She would've told me.
Andy Dwyer,That leaves four suspects.
Andy Dwyer,"There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,They said I was retired.
Andy Dwyer,They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.
Andy Dwyer,Turns out they were right and wrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, fellow Pawneeans."
Chris Traeger,"As you know, the founder's week festivities kick off tomorrow."
Chris Traeger,"Um, one small announcement: Due to a tragic misunderstanding, the prettiest pig beauty pageant has been replaced by a pork rib barbecue competition."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"But on to less grisly news, thank you for participating in our special founder's week public forum led by councilwoman Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city."
Leslie Knope,Obesity and diabetes are down.
Leslie Knope,Test scores are up.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.
Leslie Knope,"People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals."
Leslie Knope,I am very proud of what we've accomplished.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap."
Leslie Knope,I am here today to ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Are you better off now than you were a year ago?
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association."
Kathryn Pinewood,This town is not better off.
Kathryn Pinewood,"This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hellbent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, counterpoint."
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms."
Leslie Knope,I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.
Leslie Knope,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining about"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I see them."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Darren!
Tom Haverford,Slow down!
Tom Haverford,"That sweat suit's not for sweating in, okay?"
Tom Haverford,This is crushed velvet.
Tom Haverford,"If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart."
Tom Haverford,This looks dope.
Tom Haverford,Let's pay for it.
Tom Haverford,Business is booming.
Tom Haverford,"If it keeps up like this, I would leave the Parks Department and do RentASwag fulltime, maybe even expand."
Tom Haverford,"I could add a baby section over there, call it ""Li'l Swaggers."""
Tom Haverford,"I could add some old people stuff, call it ""RentASag."""
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, no."
Tom Haverford,Old people are gross.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, dingdong!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Can I go home?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"My tumtum feels gross, and also, I hate working."
Tom Haverford,"I guess, but find someone to cover for you, okay?"
Tom Haverford,'Cause we're really busy right now.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Also, a lawyer guy called you."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"He sounded really sexy on the phone, and I was very into that."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Like, I was, like, very into that."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's set up some boundaries on what's cool for you to say to me, okay?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Okay.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I frenched my cousin one time.
Tom Haverford,That's gross.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I might still be in love with him.
Tom Haverford,Please leave.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All right, bye."
Trevor Nelson,"Tom Haverford, my name is Trevor Nelsson."
Trevor Nelson,I represent a client who would like to make you an offer.
Tom Haverford,Babyface heard my demo?
Tom Haverford,I will accept a record deal.
Trevor Nelson,"No, you deeply misunderstand."
Trevor Nelson,My client has taken an interest in RentASwag.
Trevor Nelson,He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, Diddy wants to buy RentASwag?"
Trevor Nelson,Not what I said.
Tom Haverford,This is a lot to process.
Tom Haverford,Will Diddy be coming to the meeting?
Trevor Nelson,I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.
Trevor Nelson,It would violate confidentiality.
Tom Haverford,I understand.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hello Ann."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,"What do you want, Macklin?"
Andy Dwyer,Me?
Andy Dwyer,Just observing.
Andy Dwyer,A little something they taught us down at Quantico.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll get out of your hair."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, there is just one more question."
Andy Dwyer,Congratulations.
Ann Perkins,Is that a question?
Andy Dwyer,"It's an accusation, 'cause I know your secret."
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I'm not pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,You're not?
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Who is?
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,It's a pregnancy test.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Someone we know is pregnant?
Ann Perkins,I'm trying to get pregnant.
Ann Perkins,That's not fair.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!"
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Boo!
Ann Perkins,We have to find out who this is.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, I don't think so."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin works alone.
Ann Perkins,I will buy lunch.
Ann Perkins,You can have as many burgers as you want.
Andy Dwyer,Welcome to the FBI.
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success."
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.
Ben Wyatt,We're now ninth.
Chris Traeger,"Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees."
Leslie Knope,"A gym opened, and it stayed in business."
Leslie Knope,And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.
Kathryn Pinewood,But where will it end?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies."
Leslie Knope,Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.
Leslie Knope,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.
Kathryn Pinewood,They're made from plants.
Kathryn Pinewood,Stop restricting our freedoms.
Extra,Yeah!
Dewey,My name is Dewey from Sanitation.
Dewey,"Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom."
Dewey,We only have one bathroom now.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Dewey."
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.
Dewey,So you agree.
Bjorn Lerpiss,Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.
Bjorn Lerpiss,There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.
Bjorn Lerpiss,"And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Now, if I wanna start my day off with a tripledecker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day."
Bjorn Lerpiss,I work at home.
Chris Traeger,Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?
Bjorn Lerpiss,I'll never consider that.
Leslie Knope,This feels strangely personal.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.
Andy Dwyer,"How many people am I talking to, Donna?"
Andy Dwyer,One or 1 1/9?
Donna Meagle,Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Interesting.
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure it's not you?
Donna Meagle,I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.
Donna Meagle,Don't worry about me.
Andy Dwyer,Whew.
Andy Dwyer,This case just got interesting.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, not just."
Andy Dwyer,It was pretty interesting to begin with.
Andy Dwyer,This case just remained interesting.
Marshall Langman,"Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity."
Marcia Langman,"And then, you were elected."
Marcia Langman,"And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity."
Marshall Langman,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year."
Marshall Langman,And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!
Leslie Knope,"No, it's no, it's"
Marshall Langman,"This town is going to hell in a Gucci knockoff handbag, girl."
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,They agree.
Dennis Lerpiss,Come on.
Dennis Lerpiss,"I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope."
Dennis Lerpiss,This woman singlehandedly saved my business.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"There you go, perfect example."
Leslie Knope,No need for further questions on that one.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Kathryn Pinewood,"What is your business, sir?"
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value."
Herman,"Oh, it's much better now."
Extra,Yeah!
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie is the best.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, Brandi."
Leslie Knope,"Gah, gah, gah, gah"
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello, everyone."
Brandi Maxxxx,I'm Brandi Maxxxx
Extra,"Hi, Brandi."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo."
Brandi Maxxxx,I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.
Dennis Lerpiss,I've seen the first 90 seconds.
Dennis Lerpiss,It's thrilling.
Brandi Maxxxx,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town."
Leslie Knope,"No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine."
Leslie Knope,It's not like I'm some kind of sex crazed maniac or something.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, are you pregnant?"
Andy Dwyer,Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, everybody."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll get out of your hair."
Ann Perkins,Sorry to interrupt.
Andy Dwyer,Was that Brandi Maxxxx?
Tom Haverford,"Investors, I have some very exciting news about RentASwag."
Tom Haverford,"Someone I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy has offered to buy out RentASwag for a buttload of money."
Ron Swanson,"How big a buttload, son?"
Tom Haverford,We would all basically double our investments.
Donna Meagle,Are you kidding me?
Donna Meagle,"Sell, baby."
Donna Meagle,Imagine the kind of treat yourself day we could have with the profits.
Donna Meagle,I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.
Tom Haverford,That is appealing.
Ron Swanson,"If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right."
Ron Swanson,"I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson."
Tom Haverford,"April, what do you think?"
April Ludgate,I thought about this a lot.
April Ludgate,"I actually think that you should get a ""Hello Kitty"" tattoo."
Tom Haverford,"No, with the store."
April Ludgate,Oh.
April Ludgate,"Uh, burn it for the insurance money."
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, listen to me, if there's one thing I've learned"
April Ludgate,"God, nobody cares, Gary."
Tom Haverford,Enough.
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,I miss you guys.
Chris Traeger,What a wonderful event.
Chris Traeger,Everyone is having fun.
Chris Traeger,This is great.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, could you just please"
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up."
Chris Traeger,Just hang in there.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,"All right, if you'll excuse me, I found out this morning that I am playing a special role in this parade."
Chris Traeger,No spoilers.
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I hate to state the obvious, but you chose a life in politics."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go watch the parade.
Ben Wyatt,You know you can't resist a parade.
Leslie Knope,That's true.
Leslie Knope,Parades and your butt: My two vices.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,My assistant has something she'd like to show you.
Ann Perkins,Partner.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my assistant has something she'd like to show you, partner."
Andy Dwyer,"It's a positive pregnancy test, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I found it outside of Ron's cabin after our brainstorming session.
Andy Dwyer,Is there any possibility MonaLisa could be pregnant?
Tom Haverford,We always use protection but I'm pretty positive she pokes holes in them.
Tom Haverford,What brand pregnancy test is it?
Ann Perkins,"It's called ""Womb There It Is."""
Tom Haverford,That's her brand.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna be a dad?
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna have a baby with JeanRalphio's sister?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,What have I done?
Tom Haverford,"Like, to humanity?"
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.
Leslie Knope,I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,I'm so sorry.
Chris Traeger,I need to talk to you.
Ben Wyatt,What are what?
Chris Traeger,I'm the Nipple King.
Leslie Knope,Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,It's such an amazing honor.
Leslie Knope,It's wonderful.
Chris Traeger,"But I do need to talk to you about a float that is in this parade, because I'm not sure that you're going to be"
Extra,No fun for you!
Chris Traeger,Uhoh.
Extra,No fun for you!
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's not you.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's Kate Upton.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's me, and damn them."
Extra,No fun for you!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop, please!"
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is very fair!
Ben Wyatt,"Babe babe, stop wagging your finger."
Leslie Knope,Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.
Leslie Knope,But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.
Leslie Knope,I am an extremely fun person.
Kathryn Pinewood,"This float represents a group of over 300 business owners, individuals, and community leaders who are protesting unfair government regulation."
Kathryn Pinewood,We are the committee to recall Leslie Knope.
Kathryn Pinewood,Let's kick her out of office.
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Brett,Legalize weed!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Tom Haverford,"So, I need to ask you something and I kinda wish JeanRalphio wasn't here."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Please tell me that you're dumping my sister, because I will laugh I will laugh so much."
Tom Haverford,"Actually, it may be the opposite."
Tom Haverford,Is this yours?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's mine.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm pregnant.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Lemony snicket.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna be an uncle?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that a real thing?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that gonna happen?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, that's too much too much responsibility for me."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I gotta I gotta find another way out of this.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I wish you told me."
Tom Haverford,"I mean, obviously, we need to talk about our future."
Tom Haverford,"Maybe I could sell the business, and we could use the profits to put a down payment on a house or something, or"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Psych!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ah, ha, ha."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Look at your stupid face.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You had a dumdum face.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,That was hilarious.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, that was hilarious"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's hilarious
Tom Haverford,So you're not pregnant?
Tom Haverford,This isn't yours?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"[Bleep], no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Do you know how many different pills I take, birth control or otherwise?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,There is no way that I could be pregnant with a human baby.
Tom Haverford,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Tommy has his life back!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What the hell is wrong with you, man?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's my sister.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Nah!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm just kidding, man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's the worst.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You dodged a bullet, baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Congratulations.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Bad, bad, bad, bad."
Ann Perkins,"Well, Macklin, it's not MonaLisa."
Ann Perkins,"It's not me, it's not Donna, it's not Leslie."
Ann Perkins,There was only one other woman at that cabin.
Andy Dwyer,April?
Andy Dwyer,"No, she would've told me."
Andy Dwyer,"Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day."
Andy Dwyer,"And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,I don't like seeing you like this.
Leslie Knope,I've never felt this way before.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just quit.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work."
Ben Wyatt,"When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.M. to watch Meet the Press."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was Elizabeth Warren."
Leslie Knope,"Like, I'm not going to watch that live?"
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you can hate your job sometimes."
Ben Wyatt,It's allowed.
Ben Wyatt,But let me ask you this: Do you think this town is better off than it was a year ago?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Do you stand behind everything you've done?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Then screw 'em.
Leslie Knope,"But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office."
Leslie Knope,My response to them is this: Bring it on.
Leslie Knope,Step up.
Leslie Knope,Step Up 2: The Streets.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles."
Leslie Knope,Stomp the Yard.
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago."
Leslie Knope,I think you are.
Leslie Knope,"If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me."
Leslie Knope,Go crazy.
Leslie Knope,You Got Served.
Leslie Knope,"Silver Linings Playbook, kind of."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Do you have a comment on that?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"Again, all I really care about is are you better off?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'm better off.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I haven't had a date in a while, but I'm learning a lot about me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall."
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall."""
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, can you help me out here?"
Ben Wyatt,That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference.
Ben Wyatt,"And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, honey."
Leslie Knope,Honey.
Leslie Knope,That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.
Leslie Knope,"Alright, people."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.
Leslie Knope,"Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,I'll see you at the river.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh!"
Chris Traeger,Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink?"
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going with you guys?"
Ann Perkins,"We're great, actually, and we're having a good time."
Ann Perkins,Sex is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ann Perkins,"Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby."
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you.
Leslie Knope,Just remember to use protection.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, don't."
Leslie Knope,That would defeat the purpose.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no."
Leslie Knope,Do your thing.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah! My wife is pregnant!
April Ludgate,"Okay, put me down."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you can't keep it from me."
Andy Dwyer,"I found the pregnancy test, honey."
April Ludgate,"Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you sure you're not?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,We've talked about this.
April Ludgate,Remember? I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Of course.
April Ludgate,"Actually, there is something I need to tell you."
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,No! We just ruled that out.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, dang it."
April Ludgate,"Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in."
Andy Dwyer,"You did? That's amazing! Wait, why did you wait to tell me?"
April Ludgate,"Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay? I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything."
April Ludgate,"But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we could get through that."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, look."
Andy Dwyer,"It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone."
Andy Dwyer,"But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream."
April Ludgate,I'm really glad I married you.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, we made a good call on that one."
Tom Haverford,So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag.
Tom Haverford,And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems?
Tom Haverford,Is it Jay-Z?
Trevor Nelson,No.
Trevor Nelson,"But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan B: Opening his own store directly across the street from yours."
Tom Haverford,Across the street? What kind of store is it gonna be?
Trevor Nelson,"He's calling it ""Tommy's Closet."""
Trevor Nelson,"It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds."
Tom Haverford,But that's my idea and my name.
Trevor Nelson,So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now?
Trevor Nelson,"It's called capitalism, Mr. Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson."
Trevor Nelson,Only this free lesson is going to cost you.
Tom Haverford,So it's not free?
Trevor Nelson,You're right.
