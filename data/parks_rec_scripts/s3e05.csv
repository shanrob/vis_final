April Ludgate,I'm getting a cluster headache.
Jerry Gergich,He's leaving.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,I've got to throw it away.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Tom Haverford,It weighs a billion tons.
Jerry Gergich,"What is he typing, anyway?"

Ron Swanson,America.
Ron Swanson,Megaphone.
Ron Swanson,Monday.
Ron Swanson,Butthole.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but these interviews are more important than we thought."
Ben Wyatt,"Harvest Fest is two weeks away, and awareness is still pretty low."
Leslie Knope,"Boy, 35%?"
Ben Wyatt,It's actually 34.2%
Leslie Knope,"""34.2%"""
Leslie Knope,"I'm Ben, the numbers robot."
Ben Wyatt,It's just an exact calculation.
Tom Haverford,"""It's just an exact calculation."""
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio. And I even called Oprah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I tried to call Oprah."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get her number.
Leslie Knope,"I'm putting it out there, like The Secret."
Leslie Knope,"And hopefully, she'll call me."
Leslie Knope,Our first interview is at 93.7 FM with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Tom Haverford,Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Leslie Knope,They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
Tom Haverford,So much better than Tubby Tony and the Papaya.
Tom Haverford,Am I right?
Leslie Knope,They're seriously so funny.
Ann Perkins,Is this right?
Chris Traeger,"This feels almost perfect, but I don't think your core has maximized elasticity."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I'll come back, if you guys are being weird."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,"You're exactly the person that I most want to talk to, right at this moment."
Chris Traeger,And lunge.
Chris Traeger,Have you given my offer any more thought?
April Ludgate,What exactly would happen if I said yes?
Chris Traeger,"Well, you would work at the state house."
Chris Traeger,"You would coordinate my professional and personal schedule, and we would give you a small relocation fee for your move to Indianapolis."
April Ludgate,That sounds boring.
April Ludgate,But I have nothing keeping me here.
April Ludgate,Do you have Internet in your office?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Fine, I'll do it."
Chris Traeger,That is literally the best news that I've heard all day.
Ann Perkins,"Unlike April, I still do not know what my future holds with Chris."
Ann Perkins,And it's starting to bum me out.
Ann Perkins,I need some more vitamin D.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,What was that meeting about?
April Ludgate,It turns out Chris is my real dad.
Andy Dwyer,I think you're lying.
Andy Dwyer,I think I know what that meeting was about.
Andy Dwyer,You can't go to Indianapolis.
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something that I can do to convince you how much I care about you.
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me your least favorite things you have to do every day, and I'll do them for a month."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"If you do everything I hate for a month, then I might begin to think about the possibility of thinking about maybe staying."
Andy Dwyer,That's all I have to hear.
Andy Dwyer,You won't live to regret this.
April Ludgate,"Unless Andy can unkiss Ann, then I'm not going to change my mind."
April Ludgate,"But if he wants to take my dumb sister to her dumb dance class, then I'm not going to dumb stop him."
Narrator,"Crazy Ira and The Douche, 93.7"
Crazy Ira,You know why I'd never be an astronaut?
Crazy Ira,Two words.
Crazy Ira,Space farts.
Crazy Ira,You can't roll down the window of the shuttle.
Crazy Ira,"Am I right, folks?"
The Douche,"Houston, we have a-- What do you think about that, Neil Armstrong?"
Extra,"That's one small for man, one giant for mankind."
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Switching gears here now.
The Douche,"We've got Leslie Knope and Tom ""Haverfart"" and Ben Wyatt."
The Douche,And they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome."
Leslie Knope,Meets agriculture.
Leslie Knope,"And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever."
Crazy Ira,"You lost your virginity in a corn maze, didn't you, Douche?"
The Douche,That's right.
The Douche,To your mom.
Extra,Crazy Ira!
Extra,Clean your room!
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be hay rides.
The Douche,"""Hey, ride me,"" is what Crazy Ira's mom said."
Crazy Ira,Stop it!
Tom Haverford,"China Joe, you are a poet."
Extra,My bird is missing.
Extra,I need a permit to post signs.
Andy Dwyer,Let me just look for that form.
Extra,There's no time!
Extra,He can fly!
Andy Dwyer,Nine things April hates to do.
Andy Dwyer,"Number one, run the permits desk for an hour."
Andy Dwyer,That's no problem.
Andy Dwyer,"I eat ""running the permits desk for an hour"" for breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,That's-- Ow.
Extra,Henry.
Extra,Stop it.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, Henry."
Andy Dwyer,Cute kid.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Got a sec?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Extra,Henry.
Ron Swanson,"Why are you working the permits desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm trying to stop April from taking a job with Chris, so I'm doing everything she hates doing for the next month."
Ron Swanson,That's going to work?
Andy Dwyer,She said it might.
Andy Dwyer,"But it's all I've got, man."
Ron Swanson,Give me the list.
Ron Swanson,I'll help you.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't care about their relationship."
Ron Swanson,I just don't want to lose April.
Ron Swanson,I would never be able to find a worse assistant.
Crazy Ira,Okay.
Crazy Ira,"Thanks, Leslie."
Crazy Ira,"But you know, what we really want to do today is have a chat with Ben Wyatt, here."
Crazy Ira,"Come on, Ben."
The Douche,"Come on, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of guy.
Crazy Ira,"Well, it's either come with us or get in the spank chair."
Crazy Ira,"So, maybe it's time for an interview."
Crazy Ira,"Come on, everybody, give him a hand."
The Douche,Come on!
The Douche,"Come on over, Ben."
The Douche,Yeah.
Crazy Ira,"So, this guy, Ben Wyatt. We're looking him up on AltaVista."
Crazy Ira,"He's from some hick town, Partridge, Minnesota."
Crazy Ira,"And when he's 18, he's elected mayor."
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
The Douche,"Yeah, he's 18, becomes the mayor, and then blows the whole budget on an ice skating rink."
The Douche,City goes bankrupt.
Crazy Ira,Joke!
Crazy Ira,Get out of there!
Crazy Ira,"What did you call it again, bro?"
Crazy Ira,What was it called?
Crazy Ira,Say it.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town.
Ben Wyatt,I was a kid.
Ben Wyatt,And when you-- You end up getting out there and there's a--
The Douche,I really wish you guys could see this guy right now. He is drenched in sweat.
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Let's take a caller from Douche Nation.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,"Talk to me, caller."
Extra,"What's up, guys?"
Extra,Just douching over here in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,Sweet.
Extra,Seems like 18 is pretty young for a mayor.
Extra,"What were you, like, 12?"
Ben Wyatt,"The funny... When I guess... The fortunate... Can we just, sort of..."
The Douche,"Game over, man."
Extra,Game over.
Tom Haverford,"Nice job, man."
Tom Haverford,Was that your first time talking to other people?
Tom Haverford,Because it came off that way.
Tom Haverford,You embarrassed me in front of The Douche.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,I just I haven't had to deal with that mayor stuff for 17 years.
Ben Wyatt,I guess I'm not totally over it.
Leslie Knope,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it was just a bump in the road."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, the Lesliemobile is an all terrain vehicle."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything involving Ben is fine."
Leslie Knope,I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben related.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, good job."
Tom Haverford,Your boy's a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but we need him."
Leslie Knope,"If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy."
Tom Haverford,"Well, we should just slap a pair of RayBans on a calculator, because that would be way more charming."
Leslie Knope,I'll do the newspaper interview.
Leslie Knope,You and Ben do Channel Four.
Leslie Knope,Perd Hapley is a big softie.
Leslie Knope,It'll be a puff piece.
Leslie Knope,He can do it.
The Douche,"So, how are you liking Pawnee?"
Ben Wyatt,There are a lot of cars.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, not too many."
Ben Wyatt,Trucks and stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"But, you know Cool."
The Douche,"Good talk, Ice Town."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Who knew that watercress, garbanzo beans and walnuts could complement each other so well?"
Ann Perkins,"Good dressing, too, right?"
Ann Perkins,Flaxseed and agave.
Ann Perkins,Same basic ingredients as bird feed.
Chris Traeger,I'm just going to come right out and say it.
Chris Traeger,I want to define your bagua.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What's that?
Chris Traeger,It's a feng shui term.
Chris Traeger,The energy in this house is a little stale.
Chris Traeger,But I think I can redefine your flow in a very positive way.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,I'm not really attached to the way this stuff is arranged.
Ann Perkins,Or the stuff itself.
Ann Perkins,"Or this house, even, really."
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it."
Ann Perkins,Am I not being obvious enough?
Ann Perkins,I feel like I'm being obvious.
Leslie Knope,This just in.
Leslie Knope,"Harvest Festival more like ""Harvest Bestival."""
Leslie Knope,"The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You done?
Leslie Knope,They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm done."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Come on, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The Douche blew this story wide open.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us how to spend our money?
Leslie Knope,"There's no story here, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
Leslie Knope,"And he's easy on the eyes, too."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?
Leslie Knope,Strictly professional.
Leslie Knope,Just friends.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, are you colleagues or are you friends?"
Leslie Knope,We are colleagues with benefits.
Leslie Knope,We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I think I need to go.
Leslie Knope,"But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Ron Swanson,What's the next task?
Andy Dwyer,We have to write her grandmother a thank you note for a birthday check.
Andy Dwyer,"It has to be really good, too, because it's five months late."
Ron Swanson,Never written a thank you note before.
Ron Swanson,This will be fun.
Ron Swanson,What does she call her?
Andy Dwyer,Gamma.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Nanna.
Andy Dwyer,Or Nana.
Andy Dwyer,Gizmo.
Andy Dwyer,Something like that.
Andy Dwyer,This is for your Gizmo.
Andy Dwyer,I think you'll find it's pretty good.
April Ludgate,"""Dear April's grandmother"" I said grandfather."
Andy Dwyer,Oops.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"""You are a beautiful and amazing woman."""
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"""I hope someday, I can become half the woman you are."""
April Ludgate,He's a man.
April Ludgate,"""Thank you for the 500 dollars."""
April Ludgate,It was 5 dollars.
April Ludgate,"""Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD."""
April Ludgate,He is deaf.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you want me to make those changes, or is it good?"
Tom Haverford,"Before we do this next interview, there's a little secret I want to let you in on."
Tom Haverford,"It's called the ""Haverford Schmooze."""
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I was just caught off guard."
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Tom Haverford,Three easy steps.
Tom Haverford,"Smile, friendly physical contact and flattery."
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Perd."""
Tom Haverford,"""Was your dad RoboCop?"""
Tom Haverford,"""Because your arms are guns."""
Ben Wyatt,RoboCop didn't have guns for arms.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"That's so not the point, you nerd."
Ben Wyatt,Just saying.
Ben Wyatt,Why are we at a mall?
Tom Haverford,We're getting you a new suit.
Tom Haverford,I've let this go on long enough.
Ben Wyatt,I like this suit.
Tom Haverford,"You shouldn't, because it looks like garbage."
Ben Wyatt,Your suit looks more like garbage.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Because Brooks Brothers Boys doesn't make garbage.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This next thing is a photography class assignment.
Andy Dwyer,Can you figure that out?
Ron Swanson,"""Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy."""
Andy Dwyer,Melancholy.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,A sad desk.
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,Sad wall.
Ron Swanson,It's art.
Ron Swanson,Anything is anything.
Andy Dwyer,Right on.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to go drop this off and pick up the mail.
Ron Swanson,Sad floor.
Andy Dwyer,"It does look sad, kind of."
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry for stepping on you, floor."
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,You got Andy doing all your work for you?
April Ludgate,"Yes, but he said he wanted to do it."
April Ludgate,I'm only doing it because I'm getting him back--
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I don't care."
Donna Meagle,I got something to add to your list.
Donna Meagle,Yup.
Donna Meagle,There we go.
Donna Meagle,That's the stuff.
Andy Dwyer,April really does this every day?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Work the heel.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, can I be next?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,I have got a corn so big you could slap butter on it.
Perd Hapley,Welcome to Ya' Heard?
Perd Hapley,With Perd.
Perd Hapley,I'm Perd Hapley.
Perd Hapley,The story of our guests today is that they are from the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Perd Hapley,Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"What up, Perd?"
Tom Haverford,Big fan.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,What up?
Perd Hapley,"The thing about this first question is, I'd like to ask you about the Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,"Perd, it's going to be amazing."
Tom Haverford,"Carnival rides, games Sweetums is even building a plussized roller coaster for some of Pawnee's obese thrill seekers."
Tom Haverford,You must be this wide to ride.
Perd Hapley,Wow.
Perd Hapley,That's going to be a pretty big roller coaster.
Tom Haverford,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were some sticky moments."
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the videotape.
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,Who hasn't had gay thoughts?
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Perd Hapley,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you know, sometimes, I feel like I might need glasses."
Ben Wyatt,Is there a bird in here?
Ben Wyatt,"I swear, I keep seeing a bird in this studio."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe that's all there is to it.
Leslie Knope,How did this happen?
Tom Haverford,"He was fine until Perd started asking him about the ""boy mayor"" stuff."
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You look psychotic.
Ben Wyatt,I was 18 when I was elected mayor.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"So, excuse me for that."
Ben Wyatt,Cindy Eckert had just turned me down for senior prom.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know how that I should call her.
Ben Wyatt,I should.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I shouldn't."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm not going to.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm proud of myself for that.
Tom Haverford,"And then, he talked about feeling up Cindy Eckert for the first time for about five minutes."
Tom Haverford,"And then, the show ended."
Tom Haverford,"As did our careers and, probably, Harvest Fest."
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,Sadness.
Ron Swanson,That's the one.
Andy Dwyer,Natalie!
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy."
Natalie Ludgate,You're an hour and a half late.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I had to massage a ton of feet.
Andy Dwyer,Super sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Get in.
Andy Dwyer,I need to do everything on April's list or she's not going to go out with me.
Natalie Ludgate,You're into April?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk about it in the car.
Natalie Ludgate,Hold on.
Natalie Ludgate,I'll get my books.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,That should be some damage control.
Leslie Knope,I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what do we have?"
Tom Haverford,I've gotten calls from a dozen businesses thinking about pulling their sponsorships.
Tom Haverford,Sweetums might cancel the FatCoaster.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, is it too late to cancel?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's too late to cancel.
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,You're not going in front of the camera.
Ben Wyatt,Fine with me.
Police Officer,Are you trying to lure this young lady into your van?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"But she's being really difficult about it, and it's actually not my van."
Andy Dwyer,I stole it from a friend of mine.
Andy Dwyer,"I technically shouldn't be even driving, because my license is crazy expired."
Police Officer,That's Dwyer.
Police Officer,DWYER.
Andy Dwyer,Dude!
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,I've got to get out of here!
Andy Dwyer,"Natalie, tell this guy you know me."
Tom Haverford,Joan?
Tom Haverford,I thought you were Jennifer Aniston filming a movie here.
Tom Haverford,"Joan, let's make a pact, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"If we're both still single in an hour, let's get married."
Joan Callamezzo,"Tom, I'm already married."
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,To Seal.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I confused you with Heidi Klum again.
Tom Haverford,"See you later, Joan."
Tom Haverford,That's how it's done.
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, and welcome to Pawnee Today."
Joan Callamezzo,I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,"Today's guest is Leslie Knope, who is here to tell us how this year's Harvest Festival is going to bankrupt the city."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is--
Joan Callamezzo,Jumping right in.
Joan Callamezzo,That's rude.
Leslie Knope,I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
Joan Callamezzo,But at what cost?
Joan Callamezzo,How many cities does Ben Wyatt need to destroy before he's put behind bars?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,You know?
Leslie Knope,"If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Just ask any question about his past or present.
Leslie Knope,Just get it over with.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's get up here."
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Let's take some calls, Joan."
Joan Callamezzo,Why don't you?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Caller, are you there?"
Caller,"Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes for something that will hurt the town?"
Ben Wyatt,I... For...
Leslie Knope,"Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes."
Leslie Knope,"So, that's that."
Leslie Knope,Next caller?
Ron Swanson,"Do you fish, April?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Fish are gross.
Ron Swanson,Let me give you a piece of fishing advice.
Ron Swanson,"I said I don't When you have a fish on the line, you don't just drag it behind the boat."
Ron Swanson,You either reel it in or you cut him loose.
Ron Swanson,"Especially if he's a nice fish with a big, lovable fish heart."
April Ludgate,You don't know what you're talking about.
Ron Swanson,Maybe not.
Ron Swanson,Maybe you really do hate Andy.
Ron Swanson,Maybe moving to Indianapolis just to get revenge on him is a really good idea.
Ron Swanson,What do I know?
Chris Traeger,You are going to love this. Verosian tea really supercharges the bacteria in your colon.
Chris Traeger,"Plus, it smells interesting."
Chris Traeger,Waft it.
Ann Perkins,"Are we actually ever going to drink it, or we're just going to sniff it? I love sniffing."
Ann Perkins,Don't get me wrong.
Chris Traeger,You are hilarious.
Ann Perkins,"So, you're leaving soon."
Chris Traeger,"Back to Indianapolis briefly, and then, on to a town called Snerling, Indiana, for several months."
Ann Perkins,Never heard of it.
Chris Traeger,It's quite small.
Chris Traeger,The cows outnumber the people forty to one.
Chris Traeger,It sounds amazing.
Ann Perkins,I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins,I love spending time with you.
Chris Traeger,"And I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,I just think we need to talk about what that means for us.
Ann Perkins,I don't want to be clingy.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Please.
Chris Traeger,"It is something that we need to figure out, and we should do that right now."
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy you said that.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, that's disgusting."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, it's very hard to drink."
Extra,"Yeah, why should we trust this Ben Wyatt guy?"
Ben Wyatt,Because I'm trusty.
Ben Wyatt,Trust me.
Ben Wyatt,I'm trustworthy.
Ben Wyatt,And I am working very hard to make sure that this town gets back on its feet.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Extra,"Next caller? So, I looked you up on AltaVista, and I found out that the last seven towns you've gone to ended up bankrupt."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"First of all, why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997? And second, I am a budget specialist."
Ben Wyatt,"I went to those towns because they were bankrupt, and now, they aren't."
Ben Wyatt,"And yeah, I screwed up when I was 18, but who doesn't do dumb stuff when they're 18? Joan?"
Joan Callamezzo,I stole my gym teacher's husband.
Ben Wyatt,"So, there you go."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"What else you got, callers? Going once, going... Here we go."
Extra,"Yeah, hi."
Extra,Can you tell me more about the corn maze at the Harvest Festival? Are dogs allowed?
April Ludgate,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
April Ludgate,How did it go today?
Andy Dwyer,It was super fun.
April Ludgate,It was? Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You have a list for tomorrow?
April Ludgate,You want to do this again tomorrow?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I do."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, it's the deal, right? I got to do it for a whole month, and then, you're not going to move to Indianapolis."
April Ludgate,I better be the only person you kissed today.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm positive that you are."
Ben Wyatt,"If I thought you were serious, I'd be offended, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,But I know that we're buddies.
Ben Wyatt,And I know you wouldn't do that to me.
Ben Wyatt,"But, no, this is a birthmark, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,Okay? This is the little scar I got when I was nine and I fell off my bike.
Ben Wyatt,"So, no, I'm not perfect."
Leslie Knope,I can't look away.
Tom Haverford,It's amazing.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, wait, wait."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, here's the best part."
Perd Hapley,"Okay, that's all the time we have here on Ya' Heard? I'm Perd Hapley, Channel Four."
Ben Wyatt,"More like ""Turd Crapley."""
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah? Bravo! Thank you very much.
