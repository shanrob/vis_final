Leslie Knope,What?
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha!
Joan Callamezzo,"And because you lied about it, we cannot make this a book club selection."
Leslie Knope,I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I'd stake my reputation on it.
Leslie Knope,"I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism."
Joan Callamezzo,In what way?
Leslie Knope,That way.
Leslie Knope,"You put ""gotcha"" on my face."
Joan Callamezzo,After the break: Where was Leslie Knope actually born?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee!
Joan Callamezzo,We will pull out the world map and speculate wildly.
Music,Joan gotcha
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Not the gotcha dancers.
Music,"betcha thought you'd get away witcha butcha got caught, didn't ya?"
Music,Joan gotcha.
Chris Traeger,That was despicable!
Chris Traeger,I am horrified at her tactics.
Chris Traeger,"That said, the show was pretty lively."
Chris Traeger,Joan gotcha!
Tom Haverford,Don't it hurtcha?
Chris Traeger,It's very catchy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan."
Leslie Knope,Get that sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control."
Andy Dwyer,All right.

Andy Dwyer,"Unless he's in trouble, there's only one man for the job."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,You thought I was dead?
Andy Dwyer,So did the president's enemies.
Ann Perkins,Call if you need us.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"All right, so we don't have to fact check anymore."
Ann Perkins,But Leslie wants us to be on ready alert one just in case something comes up.
Ron Swanson,Now I can get some real work done.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think I'm just gonna hang out here with you guys, if that's cool."
April Ludgate,It's not.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,I could leave.
Ann Perkins,I could.
Ann Perkins,But I'm not going to.
Ann Perkins,"I will get my one minute of small talk, damn it."
Ann Perkins,"And it will be casual, and it will be amicable!"
Joan Callamezzo,Did Leslie leave?
Joan Callamezzo,We wanted her to sign the gotcha wall.
Tom Haverford,Joanie.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, now."
Tom Haverford,What was that?
Tom Haverford,I thought we were gonna get that sticker.
Joan Callamezzo,"Sorry, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,"But I am, first and foremost, a journalist."
Tom Haverford,Let us take you to lunch.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,We'll talk about the book.
Tom Haverford,And Whatever else may come up.
Joan Callamezzo,Let me go change into something more tantalizing.
Joan Callamezzo,All right?
Ben Wyatt,"So, what?"
Ben Wyatt,We're taking her to lunch now?
Tom Haverford,"Ben, Leslie hired my company to get her that sticker."
Tom Haverford,"You're the one that told me ""businesses"" need ""clients"" to get ""money."""
Ben Wyatt,I was the first one to tell you that?
Tom Haverford,Don't worry.
Tom Haverford,This is in the bag.
Tom Haverford,Joan's a married woman.
Tom Haverford,She wants what she can't have.
Tom Haverford,It's a game of cat and mouse.
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Our journey begins on page one, the preface."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,"I think I speak on behalf of everyone in the entire world when I say, We need to know the truth about where you were born."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Well Leslie?
Chris Traeger,Let me handle this.
Chris Traeger,Does it really matter?
Chris Traeger,"I mean, how many of you were actually born in Pawnee?"
Chris Traeger,Sure enough.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here."
Extra,"If you were so born here, then where's your birth certificate?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around with me"
Mel,Why?
Mel,Because you're hiding something?
Mel,You should go back where you came from.
Leslie Knope,I am back from where I came from!
Mel,That sentence was confusing!
Mel,You might as well be from China!
Mel,Tell us!
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous!
Mel,Is it?
Leslie Knope,I'm from here!
Andy Dwyer,"This crowd getting very hostile, Ms. Knope."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get you outta here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Back off!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Chris Traeger,Thank you. Goodbye everbody.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, go, go!"
Joan Callamezzo,"When I was 18, Val Kilmer saw me at a mall and told me I should model."
Ben Wyatt,That never happened.
Tom Haverford,"So, Joan, how is married life treating you?"
Tom Haverford,Your husband still know he's the luckiest man in the world?
Joan Callamezzo,Santino and I are divorcing.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,It's actually quite liberating.
Joan Callamezzo,I'm a woman with a strong sexual appetite.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm like a caged peacock, yearning for the wind on her haunches."
Ben Wyatt,That's a powerful metaphor.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe we can get that book club sticker in order, and we can work on unlocking that peacock cage."
Joan Callamezzo,"Things have changed, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,Don't make any promises you can't keep.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'll have another drink, and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right."
Joan Callamezzo,"Drink up, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,I'm gonna go powder my nose Amongst other things.
Joan Callamezzo,If you know what I mean.
Joan Callamezzo,Crap.
Ben Wyatt,Is she gonna powder her vagina?
Tom Haverford,"You gotta help me, man."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Seems to be going the usual amount of gross.
Tom Haverford,"No, this is way different."
Tom Haverford,She's not married anymore.
Tom Haverford,"She had, like, five bottles of alcohol, she's calling me ""caramel."""
Tom Haverford,You've gotta throw some cold water on this situation.
Tom Haverford,Start talking about nerd stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, nerd culture is mainstream now."
Ben Wyatt,"So when you use the word ""nerd"" derogatorily, means you'the one that's out of the zeitgeist."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, that's perfect."
Tom Haverford,Just like that.
Tom Haverford,Be incredibly boring.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I've made a little progress."
Ann Perkins,I'm up to four seconds with April.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,"I was looking to get some new music, and I was wondering if you could recommend anything."
April Ludgate,The Internet.
Ann Perkins,I really like your haircut.
Ann Perkins,where'd you get it?
April Ludgate,Prison.
Ann Perkins,How's your sister doin'?
April Ludgate,She has the shingles.
Ann Perkins,Who's your favorite character on Sex and the City?
April Ludgate,Alf.
Ann Perkins,And Nine seconds with Ron.
Ann Perkins,You're stranded on a desert island.
Ann Perkins,What is the one thing that you bring with you?
Ron Swanson,Silence.
Elizabeth Barnes,We did a flash poll.
Elizabeth Barnes,68% of Pawneeans now believe you're lying about where you were born.
Leslie Knope,13% believe I'm crazy eyed? What? Why?
Elizabeth Barnes,Honesty is important to voters.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, I can end this now."
Leslie Knope,Here's my birth certificate.
William Barnes,Mmhmm.
William Barnes,"Well, this just says ""Wamapoke County."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's the county Pawnee is in.
William Barnes,"Well, no."
William Barnes,This won't do it.
William Barnes,"See, you staked your reputation on this."
William Barnes,"So you need to go down to the county records office in Eagleton and get the original, long form certificate."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
Leslie Knope,I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
Leslie Knope,"And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks."
Alexis Pratchett,"Hello and welcome to the Wamapoke County Records Office, here in beautiful Eagleton."
Alexis Pratchett,My name is Alexis Pratchett.
Leslie Knope,"Take it down a notch, Alexis."
Leslie Knope,I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Alexis Pratchett,"Ooh, I'm sorry."
Alexis Pratchett,It takes three to eight weeks to receive a birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm Chris."
Chris Traeger,I was wondering if you might make an exception for me?
Alexis Pratchett,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Alexis Pratchett,No.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,That usually works.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,I need that birth certificate.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wait here."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin is on the case.
Leslie Knope,Andy
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,Believe in me!
Andy Dwyer,That's broken.
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,Real quick.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, spell your last name for me."
Joan Callamezzo,Let's hear it for the boys Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,That was as long as it was loud.
Joan Callamezzo,"Take me home, dumpling."
Joan Callamezzo,It's beddy time.
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ben."
Tom Haverford,You like Star Trek.
Tom Haverford,Talk about that for a little bit.
Ben Wyatt,They're making a sequel I'm assuming with the same alternate timeline.
Ben Wyatt,"But if J.J. Abrams and company expect us to believe that it's Spock with the romantic tension with Uhura and not Kirk Well, let's just say, the message boards are goin' nuts."
Joan Callamezzo,I wanna take you both home and [bleep] bend you over and just [bleep].
Joan Callamezzo,At the same time.
Joan Callamezzo,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,I'm leaving.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,We gotta get her home.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, I know your business is failing, but this just isn't worth it."
Tom Haverford,"It's not about the business anymore, man."
Tom Haverford,she's a disaster.
Tom Haverford,We gotta make sure she gets home safe.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's get her on the bed."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,One.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Two.
Tom Haverford,Three.
Tom Haverford,"Let's go, bro."
Tom Haverford,"Say what you will about Joan, but she knows how to decorate a bedroom."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Where the hell am I?
Tom Haverford,I just wanna see how soft these sheets are.
Tom Haverford,One second.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, no."
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Ah!
Tom Haverford,"Joan, we left you some water and aspirin by the bed!"
Tom Haverford,Bye!
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,I also got this dude's briefcase.
Andy Dwyer,It was just laying there.
Andy Dwyer,Kind of a panic move.
Chris Traeger,"I believed in you, buddy."
Chris Traeger,But you should put that back.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so."
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,I'm from Eagleton!
Leslie Knope,Is it true mom?
Leslie Knope,Was I born in Eagleton?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Yes, it's true."
Leslie Knope,No!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So we had to go to the next closest hospital.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm sorry.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Did you expect me to give birth to you in an infested, disease filled room?"
Leslie Knope,"Mom, why didn't you tell me?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You try telling that little girl she's not from Pawnee.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I certainly couldn't.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So you were technically born in Eagleton.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,The people of Pawnee care.
Leslie Knope,I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar!"
Leslie Knope,I'm the liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm worse than a liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm an Eagletonian.
Ann Perkins,Morning.
Ann Perkins,Is Leslie here?
Ann Perkins,"Aw, man."
Ann Perkins,I am so tired.
Ann Perkins,I took a half shift at the hospital last night.
Ann Perkins,And I had this really weird patient.
April Ludgate,Weird how?
Ann Perkins,I probably shouldn't talk about it.
Ann Perkins,It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
Ron Swanson,Talk.
Ann Perkins,"Well, this guy came in."
Ann Perkins,"He got his hand stuck in a Pringles can, and he tried to cut himself out."
April Ludgate,Was there a lot of blood?
Ron Swanson,What kind of blade did he use?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, three and a half inch?"
Ann Perkins,Serrated?
Ann Perkins,Buckets of blood.
Ann Perkins,"He passed out over his arm, and slumped onto the floor."
April Ludgate,Did the bone show?
Ron Swanson,"Very good question, April."
Ron Swanson,Answer her.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,The bone showed.
Ann Perkins,Everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story.
Ann Perkins,"Boom! I win! And so when I finally cleaned up the vomit, I found the toe."
April Ludgate,I forgot about the toe!
Ann Perkins,So did we!
Ann Perkins,"Crazy, right?"
April Ludgate,That story's awesome!
Ron Swanson,Indeed.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for sharing, Jenny."
Ron Swanson,Ann was getting a little chummy.
Ron Swanson,"When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them."
April Ludgate,That's a genius move.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"You're welcome, Lester."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Voldemort, probably."
Tom Haverford,"Bad news, team."
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for Leslie's book.
Leslie Knope,The sticker is the least of my problems.
Leslie Knope,"If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over."
Ron Swanson,You don't have to tell them a damn thing.
Ron Swanson,The only thing the voters need to know about you is your name.
Ron Swanson,"And even that, I go back and forth on."
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but I disagree."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, where you were born is a piece of trivia."
Chris Traeger,Where you're from That's what makes you who you are.
Chris Traeger,And you are from Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,You're more Pawnee than anyone I know.
Chris Traeger,"So I say, tell them the truth, and trust that they're gonna respect you for it."
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, he's right."
Ron Swanson,Well said.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"You're welcome, Steve."
Tom Haverford,Joan.
Tom Haverford,Thanks so much for having Leslie back on the program.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, thank you for getting me home last night."
Joan Callamezzo,"I wasn't, uh, feeling very well."
Joan Callamezzo,Because of some bad seafood that I ate.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, that's probably what it was."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
Leslie Knope,"I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton."
Joan Callamezzo,"What? Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for."
Leslie Knope,"I learned something, Joan."
Leslie Knope,It's not where you're born.
Leslie Knope,It's where you're from.
Leslie Knope,"When I was nine years old, I broke my arm."
Leslie Knope,Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
Leslie Knope,"You know, ""nipple hill""."
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Leslie Knope,It gets very slippery there.
Joan Callamezzo,I know that.
Leslie Knope,Especially when it's wet.
Joan Callamezzo,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And, Jim."
Leslie Knope,Jim Kabernick.
Leslie Knope,I know Jim.
Leslie Knope,"Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old."
Jim Kabernick,"Yes, that's true."
Leslie Knope,Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade
Jim Kabernick,Why why did you bring that up? I said yes.
Leslie Knope,"You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out."
Leslie Knope,"And everybody called you ""the gerbil"" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?"
Jim Kabernick,"Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV."
Leslie Knope,The point is you can't choose where you were born.
Leslie Knope,But you can choose where you live.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I always have.
Leslie Knope,I always will.
Leslie Knope,And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Leslie Knope,And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm not crazy."
Leslie Knope,"I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago."
Leslie Knope,But it's a great place to live.
Leslie Knope,And work.
Leslie Knope,And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world."
Leslie Knope,"So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town."
Leslie Knope,"Somewhere, those waffles exist."
Leslie Knope,Why can't it be here?
Leslie Knope,Joan put us in her book club.
Leslie Knope,Although I could do without this.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,Here's the thing.
Jerry Gergich,I've been all over the State.
Jerry Gergich,"Indianapolis, Bloomington, Lafayette, Muncie, Gary All the places you mention in the book."
Jerry Gergich,And I interviewed all the people you mentioned.
Jerry Gergich,"And so far, there is not one incorrect fact."
Jerry Gergich,"So now I'm going to head to the house, say hey to Gayle, wish my daughter a happy belated birthday It was yesterday And then I'm gonna head back out and hit all the towns in the southeast."
Jerry Gergich,But is there anything I should know? Any new info?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Leslie Knope,Godspeed.
Jerry Gergich,Doing what I can.
Jerry Gergich,"Yep! Hey, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,"Gotta go, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Can't talk.
Leslie Knope,He just seemed so happy.
Donna Meagle,I didn't say anything.
