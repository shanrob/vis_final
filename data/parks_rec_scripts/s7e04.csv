Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Doors are locked.
Ben Wyatt,We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
Ben Wyatt,You're trapped in there.
Tom Haverford,We told security not to disturb you under any circumstances.
Tom Haverford,And the phones and Internet?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, they've been disconnected."
April Ludgate,And I left a rusty hacksaw on the table.
April Ludgate,"So, the first person who hacks their face off gets released."
Andy Dwyer,That's not-- What?
Andy Dwyer,Is that true?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is insane, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let us out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!"
Leslie Knope,It's the series finale.
Leslie Knope,Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it makes sense if you've read the books."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, our baby monitor is on the table."
Ben Wyatt,"If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grownups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office."
Ben Wyatt,"Otherwise, we will see you at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning."
Ron Swanson,I am going to break out of here.
Ron Swanson,"Then, I am going to snap you in half."
Donna Meagle,Hey!
Donna Meagle,"This is not his fault, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,Be a man and get your house in order.
Donna Meagle,"You, too, Knope."
Jerry Gergich,"Good luck, you guys."
Jerry Gergich,I really hope you can work out your differences.
Ron Swanson,Terry.
Ron Swanson,Look at me.
Ron Swanson,Is this what you want to do?
Ron Swanson,"Think very carefully, son."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"That's right, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"For once in your life, do something right."
April Ludgate,"Stop it, Terry!"
April Ludgate,Both of you.
April Ludgate,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, Terry!"
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Terry!"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Think.
Ron Swanson,There must be a way out of here.
Leslie Knope,I don't think there is.
Leslie Knope,They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.
Leslie Knope,There's no way around them.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, there is."
Ron Swanson,I'll simply punch my fist through a window.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there's security wire in there."
Leslie Knope,You'll slice your arm open.
Ron Swanson,I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 hours.
Leslie Knope,There is another way.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much."
Leslie Knope,"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now."
Ron Swanson,Why do I have to be stubborn?
Ron Swanson,Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?
Leslie Knope,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.
Ron Swanson,We are not saying I was the problem.
Ron Swanson,"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason."
Ron Swanson,That sounds good.
Ron Swanson,Let's go with that.
Leslie Knope,Hut!
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,I destroyed the monitor!
Ron Swanson,What if we have an emergency and have to get out of here?
Leslie Knope,I did not consider that possibility!
Leslie Knope,Everything's different.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything."
Ron Swanson,Did he?
Ron Swanson,I tried not to notice anything when I worked here.
Ron Swanson,"Or talk to anyone, or learn anyone's name."
Ron Swanson,"You of all people should know that, Lauren."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours."
Leslie Knope,"We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing."
Ron Swanson,"I choose ""sit here."""
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron, why don't we just--"
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Leslie Knope,I bet I can make you talk.
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that bet at any odds, for any amount of money, over any length of time stretching from now into infinity."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me!
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,"One word, and this is over."
Leslie Knope,"I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else."
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ron loves plastic."
Leslie Knope,"Last chance, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to talk?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Ah-hah!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"You know what this is, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007."
Leslie Knope,I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.
Leslie Knope,You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.
Leslie Knope,A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.
Leslie Knope,But I am not going to play your choice.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna sing along.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.
Leslie Knope,And guess what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know the words.
Leslie Knope,"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!"
Leslie Knope,I got it on repeat.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, next verse."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel
Ron Swanson,Stop this!
Ron Swanson,I will speak with you for three minutes.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,"So, what would you like to talk about?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We were friends for 10 years.
Ron Swanson,We were work proximity associates.
Leslie Knope,We were friends.
Leslie Knope,And now we're not.
Leslie Knope,"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship."
Leslie Knope,And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.
Leslie Knope,A well organized chart.
Leslie Knope,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships."
Ron Swanson,Work proximity associateships.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, April comes to work for me."
Leslie Knope,We throw her a party.
Leslie Knope,"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree."""
Ron Swanson,I remember.
Ron Swanson,You made me wear a leather jacket.
Leslie Knope,That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,"One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me."
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time."""
Leslie Knope,"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it."
Leslie Knope,"What the hell, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?
Leslie Knope,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?
Leslie Knope,"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk."
Leslie Knope,And you're gonna tear all the houses down?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Ann lived there, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's Ann's old house.
Leslie Knope,That's my best friend's old house.
Leslie Knope,That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smoky eye look.
Ron Swanson,She hasn't lived there for five years.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,This building is a monstrosity.
Leslie Knope,And what's it called?
Leslie Knope,"""Morningstar?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, dear."""
Leslie Knope,"""We live at the Morningstar."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's so posh and hibbley fibbley gibbley."""
Ron Swanson,The world needs apartment buildings.
Ron Swanson,The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy your new job, Judas."
Leslie Knope,You tear down Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks."
Ron Swanson,That's not the whole story.
Leslie Knope,What does that mean?
Ron Swanson,It means what it means.
Ron Swanson,That is not the whole story of why I left.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, your time is up."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Why then?
Leslie Knope,What was the reason?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, you made a key?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, don't--"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on!"
Ron Swanson,See you tomorrow morning.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Progress.
Leslie Knope,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Go away.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?"
Ron Swanson,That was you?
Leslie Knope,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.
Ron Swanson,The name of the store is Food and Stuff.
Ron Swanson,"They sell food, and they sell stuff."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food."
Leslie Knope,It's called Whole Foods.
Leslie Knope,And is that really the reason?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,How many more questions are you going to ask me?
Leslie Knope,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing?"
Ron Swanson,I know I saw it.
Ron Swanson,Ah-hah!
Ron Swanson,Detonator.
Ron Swanson,The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just wait a second."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that [bleep] door and walk out as a free man."
Ron Swanson,It's in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,There's no cursing in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,"Look, before you do thatâ¦"
Ron Swanson,Too late.
Ron Swanson,Here we go.
Ron Swanson,Fire in the hole!
Leslie Knope,Woohoo!
Leslie Knope,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.
Ron Swanson,You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was."
Leslie Knope,"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such."
Ron Swanson,You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?
Leslie Knope,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've been doing an explosive job!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It's funny stuff.
Leslie Knope,Who gets angry at balloons?
Leslie Knope,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,What's all this?
Leslie Knope,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit."
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman."
Leslie Knope,This is a code.
Leslie Knope,I am going to break it.
Leslie Knope,And this is my best shot.
Ron Swanson,Is that nuclear waste?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is my job application from when you hired me.
Ron Swanson,How did you get that?
Leslie Knope,Freedom of Information Act request.
Leslie Knope,But here's the thing.
Leslie Knope,I've never read it.
Leslie Knope,This application contains your very first impressions of me.
Leslie Knope,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,The beginning of the whole shebang.
Leslie Knope,This is all you wrote?
Leslie Knope,Three lousy lines?
Ron Swanson,Why would anyone need more than three lines?
Ron Swanson,"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique."
Ron Swanson,I forgot what I wrote.
Ron Swanson,Can I hear it?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you read it yourself?
Ron Swanson,"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."""
Ron Swanson,"So far, so accurate."
Ron Swanson,"""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."""
Leslie Knope,You forgot the last sentence.
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't."
Ron Swanson,I remember that part.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Hire her."""
Ron Swanson,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,It's a person.
Leslie Knope,It's another person!
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Janitor!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we're trapped in here!"
Ron Swanson,Hey!
Ron Swanson,"Please, Mr. Janitor."
Ron Swanson,"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ron Swanson,I'll watch a foreign film.
Ron Swanson,I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"He's gone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,He's gone.
Leslie Knope,Why did you give me the job?
Leslie Knope,And that's what I don't get.
Leslie Knope,We should've never worked together.
Leslie Knope,Why did you hire me?
Ron Swanson,Because of your interview.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I remember that interview."
Leslie Knope,You were wearing that exact outfit.
Leslie Knope,"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you."""
Leslie Knope,"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?"""
Ron Swanson,You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.
Ron Swanson,Basic nonsense.
Leslie Knope,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense."""
Leslie Knope,"""Good day."""
Leslie Knope,And that was it.
Ron Swanson,"No, that was not it."
Ron Swanson,"After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree."""
Ron Swanson,Did you let me have it.
Ron Swanson,"That was one of your top 10 tirades, I'd say."
Ron Swanson,You were pounding your fist and shaking.
Ron Swanson,You called me a heartless thug.
Leslie Knope,I most certainly did not.
Ron Swanson,"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job."
Ron Swanson,I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yes-man.
Ron Swanson,Should be one more thing in that file.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview."
Leslie Knope,You kept it.
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, okay."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together."""
Ron Swanson,Liar.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I was being really optimistic."
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope."""
Ron Swanson,That was the real reason I hired you.
Ron Swanson,Those brownies were damn good.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, look how far we've come."
Leslie Knope,We're doing so great.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just bring it home, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's just talk about our issues.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, don't push it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me."
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, playtime is over."
Ron Swanson,I'm getting out of here once and for all.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,"God, no!"
Leslie Knope,That alarm is just for sprinklers.
Leslie Knope,April kept pulling it.
Leslie Knope,So the fire department disconnected it.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I found some towels.
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga."
Ron Swanson,These are the only dry clothes I could find.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look great."
Ron Swanson,I feel extremely angry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Stop whining, you big baby."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you without a mustache.
Leslie Knope,I've seen it all.
Leslie Knope,"There's nowhere to run, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You have tried every possible means of escape.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to do but talk.
Leslie Knope,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Spill it.
Ron Swanson,You left.
Ron Swanson,"Then a month later, you took Terry with you."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Swanson,Then you took April.
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances."
Ron Swanson,But your offer was too good to pass up.
Ron Swanson,So I didn't try to stop her.
Ron Swanson,Then Tom left to run his business.
Ron Swanson,Donna left to run hers.
Ron Swanson,"One day, I looked up."
Ron Swanson,Just didn't recognize anyone.
Ron Swanson,So I made a decision.
Ron Swanson,An unthinkable decision.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my, my, my."
Leslie Knope,Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, April."
Ron Swanson,Larry.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, It's Terry now."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,As luck would have it--
Leslie Knope,One second.
Leslie Knope,"Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, this is a crazy day."
Leslie Knope,"So what's up with you, you big lug?"
Ron Swanson,Nothing important.
Ron Swanson,Just thought you might want to have lunch.
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,I would love to.
Leslie Knope,It's been too long.
Leslie Knope,"JJ's Diner, 12:30?"
Ron Swanson,Excellent.
Ron Swanson,See you then.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files."
Leslie Knope,Meet me at my car.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,I got to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,Can you pick up the kids?
Leslie Knope,"Oh... Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I stood you up for lunch."
Ron Swanson,"You did, yes."
Ron Swanson,"I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened."
Ron Swanson,Your life seemed pretty hectic.
Leslie Knope,Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?
Leslie Knope,You were going to ask me something.
Leslie Knope,That's why you wanted to have lunch.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you were going--"
Ron Swanson,I was gonna ask you for a job.
Ron Swanson,In the federal government.
Ron Swanson,Just saying it out loud feels dirty.
Leslie Knope,"You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again."
Leslie Knope,I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.
Leslie Knope,"God, why didn't I see that?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope,I should've been a better friend to you.
Ron Swanson,"Honestly, Leslie, it's fine."
Ron Swanson,It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.
Ron Swanson,My time in government work was over.
Ron Swanson,"Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside."
Leslie Knope,Your metaphors are so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,"But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that."
Ron Swanson,I had a good run here.
Ron Swanson,"But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that."
Leslie Knope,England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is different from what I expected to find."
Leslie Knope,"Morning, guys."
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, Leslie."
Craig Middlebrooks,"What did you do to the office? Ron, you're wearing my yoga clothes."
Craig Middlebrooks,You're gonna stretch out the elastic.
Leslie Knope,We're sorry.
Leslie Knope,Fire and money and people
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at 2:00 in the afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
April Ludgate,"Also, you have a visitor."
Leslie Knope,"No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--"
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"We just spent 12 hours together, woman."
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.
Ron Swanson,I have a small object for you.
Ron Swanson,"Call it an official peace offering, I suppose."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is very sweet."
Leslie Knope,But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.
Ron Swanson,The frame is the gift.
Ron Swanson,"When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door."
Ron Swanson,Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer-- People really don't know how to finish wood properly.
Ron Swanson,And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I everâ¦
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"You big, fat, giant sap."
Ron Swanson,That seems unnecessary.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,But I feel bad.
Leslie Knope,I don't have anything for you.
Leslie Knope,"For the first time in my life, I am present-less."
Ron Swanson,How about you buy me a meal? You hungry?
Leslie Knope,I'm starving.
Leslie Knope,"April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food."
Ron Swanson,Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?
Leslie Knope,"People are idiots, Ron."
