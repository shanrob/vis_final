Perd Hapley,It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!
Perd Hapley,"Now, to introduce your host, Johnny Karate, here is me, Perd Hapley!"
Andy Dwyer,Silence!
Andy Dwyer,"Welcome to the only show that's all about learning, music, animals, fireworks, waterskis, and above all, ice cream, pizza, ninjas, getting stronger, sharks versus bears, and above all, karate!"
Andy Dwyer,"Now, why don't you kids help me sing the welcome song?"
Andy Dwyer,Let me just grab my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,Someone has stolen my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,This seems like a case for Special Agent Burt Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't give a crap, Batman."
Andy Dwyer,You work for me.
Andy Dwyer,Increase the perimeter!
Donna Meagle,"Macklin, the President's called six times."
Donna Meagle,"If we don't get that guitar back, the peace in Iraq will be canceled."
Andy Dwyer,"Get off my back, Chief!"
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing the best I can.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't play by the rules, but I get results."
Donna Meagle,Dang it.
Donna Meagle,"You're right again, Macklin."
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,You're the best agent I've seen.
Donna Meagle,And I've worked with James Bond.
Donna Meagle,This clue may help.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,It was left at the crime scene.
Andy Dwyer,You're dismissed.
Andy Dwyer,This case just keeps getting deeper and deeper.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drowning in the adult end of the pool, and the lifeguard's off in the bathroom pooping."
Andy Dwyer,"That's good, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate's guitar has been stolen.
Andy Dwyer,That instrument is worth literally 900 million dollars.
Andy Dwyer,"But more importantly, he can't play the goodbye song without it."
Andy Dwyer,"So by the time this show is over I will find who stole it, and they will pay the ultimate price."
Extra,A oneway ticket to the Funky Monkey Dunk Tank!
Andy Dwyer,All that and more on the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!
Andy Dwyer,"It's time to punch boredom in its stupid face Jump, kick, punch and drop And dropkick sadness into outer space Punch, yeah, till you drop It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show"
Andy Dwyer,"So, karate masters, you are here for an extra awesome and super special episode of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,And that is because it's my final show.
All,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,Don't look glum.
Andy Dwyer,"In a couple of weeks, I'll be moving to Washington, D.C."
Andy Dwyer,It's the capital of the entire world.
Andy Dwyer,"They have things there like this white house, and this mental institution."
Andy Dwyer,"And my very favorite, the Lincoln Memorial."
Andy Dwyer,It's this crazy statue of this giant monster sitting on a chair that represents all of America's enemies.
Andy Dwyer,I'll be moving to Washington D.C.
Andy Dwyer,"Because my wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer, has accepted an amazing job there."
Andy Dwyer,I'm very proud of her and totally in love.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you come on out and talk to the children?
Andy Dwyer,Take a bow for being so cool.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Johnny!"
April Ludgate,So since it's your final show I wanted to do one last extra special April's Animal Corner.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,"This week I brought one of the scariest, weirdest animals in the whole world, A goliath bird eating tarantula."
April Ludgate,"Now the name ""Goliath"" means ""giant."""
April Ludgate,"And you can see that-- Andy, where is it?"
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh.
April Ludgate,Where is it?
Andy Dwyer,Don't look at me.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what happened.
Andy Dwyer,I took it out to play hide and seek.
Andy Dwyer,I couldn't find it.
Andy Dwyer,And Oh.
Andy Dwyer,That's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, once again, April's Animal Corner has turned into one of our favorite segments."
Andy Dwyer,Loose Animal in the Studio.
April Ludgate,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,"And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer."
Andy Dwyer,Boring.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't read this disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,Good point.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids."
Andy Dwyer,So be on the lookout for a-- What's it called?
April Ludgate,A Goliath birdeating tarantula.
April Ludgate,"Known locally to Venezuelans as ""The Devil's Fist."""
April Ludgate,"Bye, kids."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids, well, we've got a lot of work to do performing the Five Karate Moves to Success."
Andy Dwyer,Sing it with me!
Andy Dwyer,"Today we're going to make something, learn something, karate chop something. And then we'll try something new, even if it's scary to you."
Andy Dwyer,"And finally we'll have some fun being nice to someone, Because that's the Johnny Karate way"
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, let's go make something."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,How are you doing?
Ron Swanson,My contract is very specific.
Ron Swanson,I do not have to answer that question.
Ron Swanson,"This week, I am making a shadowbox frame, which can be used to display an object of great value."
Ron Swanson,This one is constructed with American cherry wood.
Andy Dwyer,"Cherry, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have just one question."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,The wood does not taste like cherry.
Ron Swanson,You cannot eat it.
Andy Dwyer,"I was not going to eat it, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I was going to lick it.
Andy Dwyer,"Always remember, kids, when you find something new, you must lick it before you eat it."
Ron Swanson,"That is incorrect, in a number of ways."
Ron Swanson,"I sure have had some fun making things with you, son."
Ron Swanson,Thank you for everything you've done for the children of this area.
Andy Dwyer,"You're welcome, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, kids."
Andy Dwyer,"This, to me, seems like a hug moment."
Ron Swanson,You are mistaken.
Ron Swanson,Remove the graphic.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, kids, it's time for our next karate move to success."
Andy Dwyer,Let's learn something.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Professor Smartbrain!"
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Johnny."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, listen, I don't know if you got my email, but I thought since this is our final show, maybe we not use the Boring Buzzer."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, kids."
Ben Wyatt,Today we're going to learn about geography.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you, Johnny, are moving to Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"I thought what we could talk about is how fast you could get there using an airplane, a train or a car."
Ben Wyatt,"Now as you can see, the airplane is the fastest."
Andy Dwyer,Not the fastest.
Andy Dwyer,What about teleporting?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"That would be really fun, but it's impossible."
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing is impossible, kids."
Ben Wyatt,Teleportation is impossible.
Ben Wyatt,It's about theoretical physics.
Ben Wyatt,You asked me to do this.
Ben Wyatt,This was a favor--
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny!"
Jerry Gergich,Mail call!
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Mailman Barry!"
Andy Dwyer,Who brought me mail today?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Johnny, you got over 500 letters, from kids who love you, asking for you and April to stay."
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, did you hear that?"
Jerry Gergich,"Now, Johnny, you also got one very special letter."
Jerry Gergich,It's from me.
Jerry Gergich,"And on the last day of your show, I thought I could read it to you."
All,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,"""Dearest Andy, I've never had a son of my own, and I just want you to know that for the past 10 years"""
Andy Dwyer,It's time to karate chop something!
Andy Dwyer,"Ninjas, attack!"
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, Geez."
Andy Dwyer,Disperse!
Andy Dwyer,"Remember, never attack a real postal employee."
Andy Dwyer,We're allowed to attack Mailman Barry because he volunteered to help us with our karate moves.
Jerry Gergich,I kind of thought I'd be holding a piece of wood or something.
Jerry Gergich,"But, you know, always happy to help."
Andy Dwyer,"Next up, we're going to try something new with my good friend Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Johnny Karate!"
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy to be here on your last show ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'm glad you're here to teach us all how to be brave.
Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, what are you going to be trying new this week?"
Leslie Knope,I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Isn't that right, April?"
April Ludgate,That is right.
April Ludgate,"Johnny, you have made so many kids and so many parents so happy that we wanted to give you a proper sendoff."
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer/ Johnny Karate, this is your life!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is amazing."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to say.
Andy Dwyer,"Literally, because normally I have a script that I have to stick to."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now.
Andy Dwyer,It's kind of a nightmare.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"You leave that to us, Johnny."
April Ludgate,"Uh, when we come back, we will take a look at the journey of Andy Dwyer."
April Ludgate,Stay tuned.
Perd Hapley,"""Now listen to some words from our sponsors"" are the words I'm saying right now."
Ron Swanson,Hire Very Good Building Company for your construction needs.
Ron Swanson,Or do not.
Ron Swanson,I am not a beggar.
Ron Swanson,End of commercial.
Ken Hotate,"The Wamapoke people have a saying, ""Only one who listens hears the cry of the wolf."""
Ken Hotate,That advice has been passed down from generation to generation.
Ken Hotate,"Today, I give that advice to you."
Ken Hotate,Listen for Coinsy the Wolf at Wamapoke Casino.
Ken Hotate,"Twice a day, one lucky visitor will hit the mega wolf jackpot, and Coinsy will howl for you."
Ken Hotate,"Wamapoke Casino, slowly taking our money back from white people, one quarter at a time."
Perd Hapley,The thing we return to now is my Johnny Karate Show return message.
Leslie Knope,Welcome back.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon."
Andy Dwyer,"""Phenomenon"" means ""to explore a cave."""
Leslie Knope,He was going through a tough time.
Leslie Knope,He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.
Andy Dwyer,I was super wasted.
Leslie Knope,"It's a kid's show, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Kid's show.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Leslie Knope,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you."
Andy Dwyer,"And now that the show is ending, I'm gonna have to start all over again."
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully there's a pit in Washington D.C. that I could fall into.
Leslie Knope,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.
Ben Wyatt,He then became a bureaucratic assistant.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, honey."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hi."
Ben Wyatt,"He was always enthusiastic, but he also kept track of his appointments by writing them on his arm."
Andy Dwyer,Still do!
Leslie Knope,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner."
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, that's so sweet."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I lost it."
Andy Dwyer,The day planner's gone.
Andy Dwyer,I can't find it anywhere.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Fitting, really."
Leslie Knope,"From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit."
Leslie Knope,"It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, Sir Edgar Covington."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Eddie!"
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing!
Edgar Covington,"Andy, I am here in this weird, flat place, to name you a loyal and true karate defender of the Queen's Realm."
Edgar Covington,Please get down on one knee.
Edgar Covington,"This honor is bestowed on those who have shown great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science."
Edgar Covington,"Therefore, I hereby dub thee a knight of the Order of the British Empire."
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Can you actually do this?
Edgar Covington,"Well, technically, only the Queen can knight somebody, but I'm so rich that she lets me do what I want."
Edgar Covington,Would you like to be knighted?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Of course not.
Ben Wyatt,It's Andy's day.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, I don't mind."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Then, yes, knight me, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this is amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Winter is coming for Ser Ben Lightstorm.
Edgar Covington,"Okay, you're both knights."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Edgar Covington,"Guys, this was so much fun."
Leslie Knope,"Friend, coworker, musician, husband Andy Dwyer--"
Andy Dwyer,Sir Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.
Leslie Knope,But his greatest creation was yet to come.
Leslie Knope,A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back!
Commercial,We know what you want.
Commercial,"Healthy, natural food that still tastes great."
Commercial,And we're here to tell you it doesn't exist. Healthy food is for suckers.
Commercial,"It tastes like garbage and if you say you like it, you're a chump and a liar."
Commercial,Be honest.
Commercial,This is what you want to eat.
Commercial,It tastes amazing.
Commercial,What's in it?
Commercial,Who cares?
Commercial,How many calories?
Commercial,Shut up.
Commercial,It's awesome.
Commercial,"Put it in your body, or you're a nerd."
Perd Hapley,"One of Andy's greatest achievements was the success of his band, Mouse Rat."
Burly,No one was doing what we were doing.
Burly,"Well, that's not really true."
Burly,We were basically playing covers of Dave Matthews songs.
Burly,So I guess you could say Dave Matthews was doing what we were doing.
Rivers,To play in a band like Mouse Rat that brought such joy to so many was... Truly was a mitzvah.
Rivers,"I should mention, I'm a rabbi now."
Perd Hapley,"For the full rockumentary, go to And now, back to the show."
Leslie Knope,"Every hero struggles with failure, faces something they cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Andy faced one of those moments just a few years ago.
Andy Dwyer,"I would've chugged that entire gallon of milk, had I not started puking out of nowhere."
Leslie Knope,"No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Leslie Knope,"But you did create Burt Macklin, a character who exemplifies everything that is great about law enforcement."
Leslie Knope,Take a look.
Andy Dwyer,My name is Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what the problem is, Sergeant."
Andy Dwyer,Just drain the ocean.
Police Officer,"Andy, on behalf of the entire Pawnee Police Department, I'd like to present you with this genuine Pawnee police badge."
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Ron Swanson,It's ensconced forever in the shadowbox we made earlier.
Andy Dwyer,How about that?
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,"Son, we spent four days making that."
Andy Dwyer,"This means so, so much to me."
Andy Dwyer,I'm a cop!
Andy Dwyer,I should get some handcuffs too!
Andy Dwyer,"Give me your cuffs, Randy."
Police Officer,"No, no."
Police Officer,It's an honorary title.
Andy Dwyer,"Stand down, sir."
Police Officer,Quit it!
Leslie Knope,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer--"
Police Officer,He's not.
Police Officer,"I want to make it clear, he's not."
Leslie Knope,You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.
Leslie Knope,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain."
Andy Dwyer,"Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene."
Andy Dwyer,Look at it under your telescope.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,It looks like there are some tiny initials.
Ben Wyatt,"""J.C?"""
Andy Dwyer,President Jimmy Carter stole my guitar?
Andy Dwyer,But why?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't think it's Jimmy Carter, buddy."
John Cena,The champ is here!
John Cena,"Hi, kids."
John Cena,Is everybody having a great time?
Andy Dwyer,I know I am!
Andy Dwyer,John Cena in the house!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're my hero!"
John Cena,Wait.
John Cena,You're Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I'm Andy.
John Cena,From the information I got I just assumed you'd be like 10 years old.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
John Cena,"That's Okay, great."
John Cena,Thank you.
John Cena,"Thank you so much, man, For bringing martial arts and music to all the children."
John Cena,"Wait, wait, wait."
John Cena,"What are you doing, man?"
Andy Dwyer,Gotcha!
John Cena,Got me?
John Cena,Wait.
John Cena,What?
Police Officer,He got my cuffs.
Police Officer,Wait.
Police Officer,What the hell is this?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're a great inspiration, a true hero, and this is the greatest moment of my life."
Andy Dwyer,But you're going down.
John Cena,Going down? What are you doing Whoa! Stop!
Andy Dwyer,You stole Johnny Karate's guitar.
John Cena,"I didn't steal his guitar, man."
John Cena,I'm just doing this as a favor.
Andy Dwyer,"You're going in the dunk tank, bud."
John Cena,I don't wanna go in the dunk tank.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up.
John Cena,"Is anybody in charge? Uh, a little help?"
Leslie Knope,"And now it's time to celebrate Andy Dwyer's greatest creation, Johnny Karate."
Leslie Knope,He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee.
Donna Meagle,Everybody was kung fu fighting
Leslie Knope,Raise it up!
Donna Meagle,Those cats were fast as lightning
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Can you believe it, babe?"
Donna Meagle,In fact it was a little bit frightening
Leslie Knope,That karate gi will stay here forever.
Leslie Knope,"Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them."
Leslie Knope,But it'll be somewhere.
Leslie Knope,And the spirit will stay with us.
Leslie Knope,Forever.
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer's final goodbye, when we come back."
Commercial,"What powers us? What gives us the tools to attain our goals, face our fears, take that next step into the unknown? It's energy."
Commercial,"Verizon, Exxon, and Chipotle are proud to announce a cross-platform merger of our three great brands."
Commercial,"Whether it's extending your 6G coverage, drilling natural gas out of shale or perfecting the chicken quesadilla, we will give you the energy to get you to the next level."
Commercial,"And with enough energy, America, nothing can stop us."
Commercial,The all-new Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.
Commercial,Proud to be one of America's 8 companies.
Andy Dwyer,I'd like to begin by saying thank you to anyone who has ever worked on the Johnny Karate Musical Explosion Show.
Andy Dwyer,"This has been the greatest job I've ever had, and today has been the best day of my life."
Andy Dwyer,And that's saying something.
Andy Dwyer,I once found a rock that looked exactly like Santa Claus.
Andy Dwyer,"Hat and everything, so... Before I say goodbye, let's review our checklist one last time."
Andy Dwyer,We made something with Carpenter Ron.
Andy Dwyer,We learned something with Professor Smartbrain.
Andy Dwyer,"We karate-chopped something, old Mailman Barry's face."
Andy Dwyer,"And we tried something new, even though it was scary to us, with Leslie Knope."
Andy Dwyer,That leaves just one more thing.
Andy Dwyer,The most important one.
Andy Dwyer,Be nice to someone.
Andy Dwyer,And I think I know right now who needs it the most.
Andy Dwyer,"My wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, come on out here."
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,Babe.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Babe? Wait!
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, where are you going? Babe."
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Where are you-- Hey, come here."
Andy Dwyer,"April, what's going on?"
April Ludgate,"It's... Every week this show is an amazing train wreck, and you love doing it, and you're the best host."
April Ludgate,"Like, even better than my all-time favorite host, Tom Snyder, which is crazy."
April Ludgate,"And all those kids love you, and you're doing what you're meant to do."
April Ludgate,And I can't be the person that makes you lose what you love.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you're what I love."
Andy Dwyer,You're the only reason I have any of this.
Andy Dwyer,"You believed in me, and you supported me, and you make me happy."
Andy Dwyer,Happier than I ever thought I could be.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, without you, I wouldn't be anything."
Andy Dwyer,You're what keeps me going.
Andy Dwyer,You're my Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.
Andy Dwyer,"As long as I'm with you, I'm going to be happy."
Andy Dwyer,So we go to Washington D.C. and then we figure out the next cool and awesome thing from there.
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, that was a very good Being Nice To Someone."
Andy Dwyer,I did it.
Andy Dwyer,Now I can go finish the show.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's time for us to go But I want you to all to know That karate's not about fighting It's about knowing who you are And being kind and honest While you're kicking for the stars Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Keep karate in your heart And aspire to your dreams And always remember you're forever on my team Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Karate yell! Hiya! Goodbye, Pawnee! I will miss you."
John Cena,Guys? Guys? Guys! Tarantula! Could somebody get me outta here? Please?
April Ludgate,"I'll help you, John Cena."
John Cena,No.
