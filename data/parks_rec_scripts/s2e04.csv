Councilman Dexhart,"And to my wife, I apologize."
Councilman Dexhart,"All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned."
Councilman Dexhart,"Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four way sex in a cave in Brazil."
Tom Haverford,I bet cave sex is insane.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Tom Haverford,Because of the echoes and the humidity.
Donna Meagle,Mmmhmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it."
Leslie Knope,I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.
Leslie Knope,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies."
Leslie Knope,Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, I heard he was."
Perd Hapley,One more shocking revelation in a story that just won't stop unfolding.
Perd Hapley,It turns out Councilman Dexhart may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair.
Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four Eyewitness News."
Mark Brendanawicz,Why does anybody wanna run for public office?
Mark Brendanawicz,You're just asking to have your entire life exposed.
Tom Haverford,"Well, if you're squeaky clean, like I am, there's no problem."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, you're married, and you hit on women constantly."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but I've never sealed the deal."
Tom Haverford,Just window shopping.
Tom Haverford,"You can fly to Brazil, just don't enter the cave."
Tom Haverford,Am I right?
Tom Haverford,Up top!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you."
Tom Haverford,"I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match."
Tom Haverford,That's it.
Tom Haverford,I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you suggesting a game?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm in.
Donna Meagle,I'm in.
Jerry Gergich,I'm out.
Tom Haverford,"Not an option, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,You're going down.
Jerry Gergich,"No, seriously, I really don't wanna play."
Tom Haverford,"No, no."
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, you are playing."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna nail you.
Ron Swanson,"I will play, too, if only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me."
April Ludgate,That's why we're all playing.
Ron Swanson,Your desk is over there.
April Ludgate,I love games that turn people against each other.
Donna Meagle,You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.
April Ludgate,A friend.
April Ludgate,Burn.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, again, I'd really rather not play."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,What are you guys doing?
April Ludgate,Trying to see who has the least amount of dirt on them in case someone wants to run for office.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, it ain't Jerry."
Dave Sanderson,That's for sure.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him."
Dave Sanderson,Public urination.
Jerry Gergich,I don't like this game.
Jerry Gergich,I just don't like it.
Dave Sanderson,He's probably gonna go anger pee in the courtyard.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you crazy park people, I'm out of here."
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, will be our first official... First date."
Dave Sanderson,Roger that.
Leslie Knope,Copy.
Leslie Knope,Over and out.
Leslie Knope,Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,I'm not nervous.
Leslie Knope,Why should I be nervous?
Leslie Knope,We're just two people going on a first date.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to be nervous about.
Leslie Knope,That was my phone.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you... What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,Just having lunch with Leslie.
Ann Perkins,What are you up to?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm looking for scandalous information about my coworkers, for a game that we're playing."
Ann Perkins,"My taxes pay your salary, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"And he looked up at me, and he said, ""Thank you."""
Ann Perkins,"""You saved my life."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night."
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I wouldn't go with a cargo pant."
Leslie Knope,"What about, like, a sexy hat?"
Ann Perkins,I don't know what that even is.
Leslie Knope,Helping already.
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna just come by after work today?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,Several hours from now?
Ann Perkins,Or you could just come over now?
Leslie Knope,I think that would be better.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that would give us more time."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what you doing, guys?"
Tom Haverford,Looking for dirt on me?
Tom Haverford,No point.
Tom Haverford,Give up now.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wait, there's this."
Tom Haverford,"Everybody, I bought a Croissan'wich this morning."
Tom Haverford,This isn't even a real receipt.
Tom Haverford,Just a scrap of paper.
Ron Swanson,Taliban robes!
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Where'd you get that photo from?
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Tom."
Donna Meagle,Nice Taliban robes.
Tom Haverford,Those aren't Taliban robes.
Tom Haverford,"That's from Halloween, 10 years ago."
Tom Haverford,I was dressed like a Jedi.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sure that the voters would be able to tell the difference.
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, looks to me like you're in the Taliban."
Tom Haverford,"Well, did everybody know that Ron's ex-wife, Tammy, is actually his second ex-wife named Tammy?"
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"Ron has two ex-wives, each named Tammy."
Ron Swanson,Both of them bitches.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, my mom's name is Tammy."
Ron Swanson,What's your point?
Ron Swanson,"Tom, that was a Jaeger secret."
Ron Swanson,You just breached a Jaeger secret.
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this just heated up quick!"
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Ann Perkins,That looks great.
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Ann Perkins,"Will you be wearing it out of the store today, madame?"
Leslie Knope,"I think I will, good lady."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?"
Ann Perkins,Shoot.
Leslie Knope,What if he asks me if I've been married?
Ann Perkins,Have you?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, say that."
Leslie Knope,But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm gonna do?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say that I was married.
Leslie Knope,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys like girls that have kids, right?"
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?
Leslie Knope,Or not enough?
Leslie Knope,What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, relax."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I just have a few more questions for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,What if he shows up with another woman?
Leslie Knope,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?
Leslie Knope,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?"
Ann Perkins,Those are all insane hypotheticals.
Ann Perkins,And I promise you they won't happen.
Leslie Knope,They have happened.
Leslie Knope,All of these have happened to me.
Leslie Knope,"No, there's more."
Leslie Knope,"One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar."
Leslie Knope,I thought it was terrible wine.
Leslie Knope,Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs."
Leslie Knope,"Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth."
Leslie Knope,I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.
Leslie Knope,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird."
Leslie Knope,"I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date."
Leslie Knope,"But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.
Ann Perkins,"I will pretend to be Dave, and you will practice on me."
Leslie Knope,That's a way better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Dave, it's me."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,It's good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Ann Perkins,You don't wanna do that quite yet.
Leslie Knope,"So, Dave."
Leslie Knope,Let's begin our conversation.
Ann Perkins,What's on the note cards?
Leslie Knope,They're possible topics of conversation.
Ann Perkins,"""Whales, parades, electricity."""
Ann Perkins,And the rest are blank.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else."
Ann Perkins,Leslie's in worse shape than I thought.
Ann Perkins,Is she practice laughing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave You!"
Leslie Knope,"The Danish call it ""op og ned apparat,"" which literally translated means the ""up and down machine."""
Ann Perkins,"Wow, that's a thorough history of the teeter-totter."
Leslie Knope,Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's amazing--
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,Just ask me a question.
Ann Perkins,Just try to get to know me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I can't think of anything to ask you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,My mind is blank.
Ann Perkins,Just ask me the first thing that comes to your head.
Leslie Knope,How big is it?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Wendy,"Hey, Tommy."
Wendy,Hi.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Wendy,Are you ready?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am."
Tom Haverford,Just give me one second.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Let me ask you something.
Tom Haverford,Do you hate black people?
Donna Meagle,Excuse me?
Tom Haverford,"'Cause, apparently, in 1988, you donated money to the presidential campaign for David Duke."
April Ludgate,The KKK guy?
Donna Meagle,I got a phone call.
Donna Meagle,They said he would lower taxes.
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,How's it feel to lose so hard?
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, honey."
Tom Haverford,Let's get coffee.
Tom Haverford,Re Ron!
Tom Haverford,"You remember my wife, Wendy Haverford."
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Wendy,"Yeah, hi."
Ron Swanson,How are things at the hospital?
Wendy,"Very good, thank you."
Wendy,I just got a pediatric surgery fellowship.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"We're celebrating, 'cause she's super rich and super hot also."
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,"Come on, Tommy."
Wendy,Cut it out.
Tom Haverford,You're super hot.
Tom Haverford,Everybody else has to deal with it.
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Tom Haverford,"See you later, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I've established a scientifically perfect ten point scale of human beauty.
Ron Swanson,"Wendy is a 7.4, which is too high for Tom, who is a 3.8."
Ron Swanson,Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Dave."
Ann Perkins,You're late.
Ann Perkins,And I can see your nipples through your dress.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ann Perkins,"In nursing school, we took a psych course on how to treat phobias with a method called ""exposure therapy."""
Ann Perkins,"So, like, if you were afraid of snakes, they would immerse you in a tank of snakes."
Ann Perkins,"So, I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date."
Ann Perkins,"You're 20 minutes late, I almost left."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,God!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was dropping my niece off."
Ann Perkins,What's your niece's name?
Leslie Knope,Torple.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,That's not a name.
Leslie Knope,I don't have a niece.
Leslie Knope,My niece's name is Stephanie.
Ann Perkins,Stop lying.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look."
Leslie Knope,There's bread.
Leslie Knope,You want some?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,I got flowers in your soup.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Leslie Knope,Just I have to go to the whiz palace.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Dave, the place where you... You know, the toilet thing."
Leslie Knope,It's a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,It's called a bathroom!
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Mark."
Jerry Gergich,A little birdie told me that you have one unpaid parking ticket.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, that's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, snap!"
Jerry Gergich,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't know that, huh?"
Jerry Gergich,I didn't know I was adopted.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm so sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I really didn't wanna play.
Mark Brendanawicz,You... That was not my intention.
Tom Haverford,It's not your fault.
Tom Haverford,He totally baited you with that unpaid parking ticket.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, could you come into my office?"
Ron Swanson,Tomato sauce.
Tom Haverford,Rontonamo Bay.
Ron Swanson,Do be seated and congratulate me.
Tom Haverford,For what?
Ron Swanson,Winning the game.
Ron Swanson,"I just found out, through some pretty impressive investigating, that your wedding was a sham."
Ron Swanson,It's a green card marriage.
Tom Haverford,That's crazy.
Tom Haverford,I was born in South Carolina.
Tom Haverford,"These colors don't run, baby."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa, Canada."
Ron Swanson,Her visa was set to expire the day after you got married at the county courthouse in front of three strangers and no family.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,We met in college.
Tom Haverford,"She wanted to work in the States, she couldn't get a permit--"
Ron Swanson,I knew it.
Ron Swanson,I knew you couldn't get a wife as hot as her.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Games aside, you gotta keep this between us."
Tom Haverford,"Don't tell anybody, please."
Ron Swanson,"Now, come on."
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna turn you in.
Ron Swanson,"Just admit that when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game."
Ron Swanson,Say it.
Ron Swanson,"Say, ""I bested you."""
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,You bested me.
Tom Haverford,Is that all?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'll have your wife tonight.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ron Swanson,I'm just kidding.
Ron Swanson,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Why would you say that, Dave?"
Leslie Knope,"That dog was, like, my best friend."
Leslie Knope,"And when she died, it was one of--"
Ann Perkins,"Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tiffany."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I definitely wanna see you tonight."
Ann Perkins,"No, I can't really talk right now, 'cause I'm on a date with this drip."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I can ask."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, do you wanna watch a porno after this with me and my wife?"
Leslie Knope,"No, Dave."
Leslie Knope,'Cause you're disgusting.
Ann Perkins,"So, it's definitely a no?"
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why you're being so terrible.
Leslie Knope,We're just two people trying to go on a date.
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be fun.
Leslie Knope,It's just a date.
Ann Perkins,"You're right, it is."
Ann Perkins,Well done.
Ann Perkins,Sorry I had to get all medical on you.
Ann Perkins,"But now you see that even if everything goes wrong, you'll survive."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,You coy bastard.
Tom Haverford,Mark.
Mark Brendanawicz,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"You hate Ron, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think Ron is fine.
Tom Haverford,"So, we're on the same page."
Tom Haverford,You gotta help me take this guy down.
Tom Haverford,There's gotta be something on him.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm starting to feel kind of gross about this game."
Tom Haverford,It's not about the game anymore.
Tom Haverford,Ron has some serious dirt on me.
Tom Haverford,I need to balance things out.
Tom Haverford,"You must know how that feels, you got tons of dirt in your past."
Tom Haverford,"Please, you gotta help me."
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a man named Duke Silver.
Mark Brendanawicz,He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He's an old friend of Ron's, maybe you should ask him."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna dig up so much dirt on this guy, there's gonna be worms all over the place."
Tom Haverford,It sounded snappier in my head.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ann is so awesome.
Leslie Knope,I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.
Leslie Knope,Catch.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff."
Leslie Knope,Me power.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Ann Perkins,You're officially first date proof.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dave."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, it is impossible that he's not gonna like you."
Ann Perkins,He's gonna freak out about how awesome you are.
Leslie Knope,"No, he's not."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, he is."
Ann Perkins,He's gonna love you.
Ann Perkins,You're cool and you're sexy and you're funny and you're smartâ¦
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Look, any guy would be lucky to date you."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hell, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Hells, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am awesome.
Ann Perkins,You are awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and you are, too."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You are, too."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You are, too, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Help, police!"
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know today is today, and it's not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that I'm awesome, and you're lucky to have me."
Leslie Knope,"And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, off the charts amazing."
Leslie Knope,Up top.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's do this bitch!"
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,Can I come and sit down for a little bit?
Leslie Knope,"Cause I walked here, 'cause... The drinking."
Dave Sanderson,I don't knowâ¦
Leslie Knope,I do know.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming inside.
Leslie Knope,"So, move, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You make a better door than a guy.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,This is gonna sound weird.
Tom Haverford,I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.
Bartender,"Yeah, he goes on in a second."
Emcee,"Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's just about that time."
Emcee,"It's with the jazziest pleasure that I bring out for you, my man, Mr. Duke Silver!"
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Dwayne."
Ron Swanson,"As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies."
Ron Swanson,"Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself."
Leslie Knope,Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, did I say something to make you worry about--"
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.
Leslie Knope,But not anymore.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you should be scared of me."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think I need to return this sweater.
Leslie Knope,I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I think that's a sweater shirt combo."
Leslie Knope,I think it's going pretty well with Dave.
Leslie Knope,He wants me.
Leslie Knope,I can totally tell that he wants me.
Dave Sanderson,I'm right here.
Dave Sanderson,"You know I'm here, right?"
Leslie Knope,Did you see my bra?
Leslie Knope,Mmm?
Leslie Knope,"Bee, boop."
Leslie Knope,"Guess what? I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Can I use your bathroom?
Dave Sanderson,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Are you impressed that I know what it's called?
Dave Sanderson,"Look, maybe I ought to give you a lift home."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, in London, they call elevators ""lifts."""
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna give me an elevator home?"
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Let's, Let's go."
Dave Sanderson,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's go down to the pub.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,That's right.
Leslie Knope,To the pub.
Leslie Knope,get a pint.
Dave Sanderson,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,This is an English accent.
Extra,What I cannot believe is Dexhart's wife.
Extra,"I mean, how clueless can you get? How did she not know this was going on? More importantly, how does she stay with him after all this? I think Dexhart's credibility"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Can I help you at 11:48 p.m?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, here's the whole thing."
Mark Brendanawicz,Here are all my skeletons.
Mark Brendanawicz,"When I was 16, I had sex with a married woman."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,"When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount of pot."
Ann Perkins,Uh-huh.
Mark Brendanawicz,Nothing insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,When I tell you what--
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,"What I'm doing is, I'm trying to tell you that I've done some stuff that I'm not very proud of."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I like you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I would rather you not find out about this from anyone but me."
Mark Brendanawicz,This was a bad idea.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,It's fine.
Ann Perkins,"I get what this is, and why you did it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Is there anything that you would like to share from your past, to sort of balance the scales?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight, to brag about getting laid when he was 16, so I shot him."
Mark Brendanawicz,Good night.
Ron Swanson,It's been a real gift making sonic love to you tonight.
Ron Swanson,"If you want more of the Duke, both my albums are for sale here, ""Smooth As Silver"" and ""Hi Ho, Duke""."
Ron Swanson,"And look for my new CD next month, ""The Memories of Now."""
Ron Swanson,"So, come see me, come talk to me, come love with me, and maybe we can walk through fire together."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Good night.
Tom Haverford,Duke! Huge fan.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"I imagine you'll wanna tell everyone about this, but I have worked pretty hard to cultivate a certain authoritative, or intimidating image around the office."
Extra,"Can I, can I get a picture?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"Say, ""I bested you!"""
Extra,I bested you.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,Thanks for loving the Duke.
Extra,Thank you.
Extra,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,That... That was a lovely photo.
Ron Swanson,Truce?
Tom Haverford,Truce.
Tom Haverford,You're kidding me.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Tom Haverford,"You showed up at the guy's house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn't even sleep with him?"
Leslie Knope,Should I have?
Tom Haverford,It never hurts.
Leslie Knope,God.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Dave Sanderson,You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night.
Dave Sanderson,"Purse, and earrings, and a shoe."
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for what happened last night.
Leslie Knope,"On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven."
Leslie Knope,I totally understand if you wanna cancel.
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,You can make it up to me tonight on our second date.
Leslie Knope,Second?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,Last night was our first date.
Dave Sanderson,"So, that would make tonight our second."
Dave Sanderson,I'm looking forward to it.
Dave Sanderson,8 o' clock?
Leslie Knope,8 o' clock.
Dave Sanderson,You like dancing?
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Dave Sanderson,"I don't, I'm a, I don't like dancing."
Leslie Knope,Then we don't have to go.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it. A.K.A, I nailed it."
Leslie Knope,"No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night."
Councilman Dexhart,"However, I wanna be clear, I have no plans to resign."
April Ludgate,Is it weird that my feelings are hurt that no one's found any dirt on me yet? Hello!
April Ludgate,I drove a riding lawn mower through a Nordstrom! There's video that I took! It's on the Internet.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Plastic surgery?
Jerry Gergich,I got hit by a fire engine.
April Ludgate,You are so lucky.
Jerry Gergich,How?
