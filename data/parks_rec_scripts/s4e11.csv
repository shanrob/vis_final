Leslie Knope,"Oh, goody, you're all here."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,This is a huge job.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to require a lot of late night, oneonone jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night."
Leslie Knope,"The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Give it up for Ann!
Ron Swanson,Good choice.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful tropical fish."
Leslie Knope,You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
Leslie Knope,You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Leslie Knope,You haven't?
Ann Perkins,No!
Leslie Knope,You will.
Leslie Knope,You're that good of a nurse.
Ann Perkins,What about Ben?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, he ran for mayor at 18 and won."
Leslie Knope,Ben is poison in my campaign.
Leslie Knope,Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
Leslie Knope,"I Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart."
Leslie Knope,"Just look at my eyes and say ""yes."""
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yes."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"I believe in you, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to have this conversation again.
Ann Perkins,Again?
Ann Perkins,You just hired me eight seconds ago.
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,You're doing a really bad job.
Leslie Knope,"William, Elizabeth."
William Barnes,"Leslie, hi."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,What are you Are you coming to see me?
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign?
William Barnes,"Actually, no, sorry."
William Barnes,We weren't here to see you.
William Barnes,We've been meeting with other potential candidates for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs?"
Elizabeth Barnes,"Yes, that's our job."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing."
Leslie Knope,They're real killers.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Andy."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right in.
William Barnes,"Well, uh, good luck, Leslie."
William Barnes,Honestly.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't need luck."
Leslie Knope,We are a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,"We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann Huh, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,"It's true I no longer have highly trained, professional campaign managers."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"Are most murders committed by highly trained, professional assassins?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're committed by friends and coworkers.
Leslie Knope,That analogy was way better in my head.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
April Ludgate,Champion?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh my gosh, there you are, puppy."
Andy Dwyer,That's a good boy.
Ben Wyatt,That is a three legged dog.
Andy Dwyer,"His name is Champion, because he's the dog world champion."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him?"
Andy Dwyer,Three!
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes him the best.
Andy Dwyer,He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.
April Ludgate,Except for digging.
April Ludgate,He's really bad at digging.
Andy Dwyer,And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?
Andy Dwyer,You want to be involved.
Andy Dwyer,"We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna send a three legged dog to his death.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.
April Ludgate,"Well, it would be nice if you helped a little."
April Ludgate,"Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs."
Ben Wyatt,"Cruel, but fair."
Ann Perkins,So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.
Leslie Knope,"""The Comeback Kid."""
Ann Perkins,Everyone loves a good comeback story.
Ann Perkins,Rocky.
Leslie Knope,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Andy Dwyer,"Terminator said, ""I'll be back,"" and he was."
Tom Haverford,Also making a comeback the casual Hawaiian shirt.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve."
Tom Haverford,I was joking.
Tom Haverford,You should soak that in bleach and burn it.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building."
Ann Perkins,"April, you finalized a rental, right?"
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Ann."
April Ludgate,I told you never to talk to me.
April Ludgate,That was Champion.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Bad dog!
April Ludgate,"Yes, everything's fine with the rental."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you're constructing the stage?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief."
Ben Wyatt,"Seal the edges by crimping the fork aw, crap."
Chris Traeger,Ben
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, Chris?"
Ben Wyatt,"Come on in, man."
Chris Traeger,I already did.
Chris Traeger,"So, uh, how you been?"
Chris Traeger,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Ben Wyatt,"Great, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just learning how to make a ""calizoinza."""
Ben Wyatt,"Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones."
Ben Wyatt,Do you want one?
Chris Traeger,"No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary."
Chris Traeger,"So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, honestly, I'm great."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.
Ben Wyatt,Isn't this just so cool?
Chris Traeger,It is so cool!
Chris Traeger,"Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help."
Leslie Knope,You look like a real campaign manager.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks, that's because I googled ""campaign manager"" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors."
Leslie Knope,"See, there's more things to look at on the Internet besides naked guys, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"I need a team update, campaign manager."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,I still can't believe that you got him.
Leslie Knope,Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
Leslie Knope,"In 1992, Pistol Pete's last second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages."
Leslie Knope,Team mascot later changed.
Tom Haverford,"Akash, buddy, of course I came to you first."
Tom Haverford,You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,But here's my question Do your carpets match your drapes?
Tom Haverford,How do you make any event classy on a budget?
Tom Haverford,Red carpet.
Tom Haverford,My entire apartment is red carpet.
Tom Haverford,"On top of that, leading into my bedroom, a second red carpet."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what's this in my shoe?"
Tom Haverford,Red carpet insole.
Tom Haverford,"Everywhere I go, I'm walking on red carpet."
Tom Haverford,Is there even enough room for everyone?
April Ludgate,"Here, sit on my lap."
Tom Haverford,"No, that's humiliating."
Tom Haverford,Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's Champion's spot."
Andy Dwyer,He called it.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, we're already late."
Ron Swanson,"Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."
Pete Disellio,"Hi, Pete Disellio."
Leslie Knope,"We can call you Pistol, right?"
Pete Disellio,I prefer Pete.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, got it."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
Leslie Knope,You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
Leslie Knope,"This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, nice to meet you."
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Pete Disellio,"Oh, thanks."
Pete Disellio,I'm excited to be here.
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,We're excited to have you.
Leslie Knope,Ann is killing it.
Leslie Knope,My campaign team is unstoppable.
Leslie Knope,This rally is going to be awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna break dance!
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,Coming!
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe."
April Ludgate,Nuhuh!
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, he is."
Andy Dwyer,He's even a better kisser than me.
Andy Dwyer,"Here, try some."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, stop it."
Tom Haverford,He's drooling on me!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Ron Swanson,This is unsafe.
Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we should do it for the kids."
Andy Dwyer,"Kids love it, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Just for the kids.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, kids!"
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look."
Andy Dwyer,The police even love it.
Andy Dwyer,They're sirening back to us.
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we Heard ya, bud!"
Leslie Knope,"And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, ""Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!"""
Leslie Knope,"You can still dunk, right?"
Pete Disellio,"Oh, I can, but I won't."
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Pete Disellio,"Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game."
Pete Disellio,It feels like I'm living in the past.
Leslie Knope,But the past is great.
Leslie Knope,"The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster."
Pete Disellio,"Look, Leslie, I read up on you."
Pete Disellio,"You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here."
Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.
Pete Disellio,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.
Pete Disellio,I'm not going to dunk the ball.
Ann Perkins,What about a layup?
Ron Swanson,"Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old."
Ron Swanson,"Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?"
Police Officer,"Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law."
Police Officer,"I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?"
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my God, April, that's horrible."
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Ann Perkins,"""My mother's butt,"" really?"
Ann Perkins,That's really helpful.
Leslie Knope,Let me talk to her.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.
Leslie Knope,Sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.
Ann Perkins,Whoa.
Ann Perkins,You just hung up on her?
Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me."
Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?"
Ann Perkins,You'll just make your speech?
Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.
Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.
Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors."
Ann Perkins,I wasn't going to.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either."
Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.
Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me."
Ann Perkins,Go.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Chris Traeger,"So, Ben"
Chris Traeger,Why Calzone?
Ben Wyatt,"Glad you asked, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, there's fast food hamburgers."
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Mexican.
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Chinese.
Ben Wyatt,Blah blah blah.
Ben Wyatt,Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?
Chris Traeger,What about pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Never heard of it.
Ben Wyatt,"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
Chris Traeger,Never thought of it that way.
Ben Wyatt,"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container."
Ben Wyatt,It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.
Chris Traeger,Amazing.
Ben Wyatt,And you of all people will like this.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.
Chris Traeger,Gamechanger.
Ben Wyatt,"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone."""
Chris Traeger,That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.
Chris Traeger,That idea is terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me."
Police Officer,"They broke about 50 laws, Knope."
Police Officer,"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally."
Police Officer,That's not appropriate.
Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team."
Leslie Knope,"I need them, please."
Police Officer,Fine.
Police Officer,"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck."
Ann Perkins,It would just mean so much to us.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're a living legend."
Ann Perkins,They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.
Pete Disellio,"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword."
Pete Disellio,"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol."""
Ann Perkins,"Tell me more about that, Peter."
Pete Disellio,"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?"
Chris Traeger,"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, thanks, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.
Chris Traeger,"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here."
Chris Traeger,I think getting some perspective would be good.
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Chris Traeger,I've known you a long time.
Chris Traeger,"And, right now, you need help."
Ben Wyatt,With my Claymaish?
Chris Traeger,With your life.
Chris Traeger,"You are wildly, insanely depressed."
Ben Wyatt,Depressed?
Ben Wyatt,I'm the furthest thing from depressed.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look at what I've accomplished."
Ben Wyatt,Do you see him?
Ben Wyatt,Do you think a depressed person could make this?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ron Swanson,That's all we can fit in here.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.
Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do."
April Ludgate,"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,He shall do it in the car!
Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann."
Pete Disellio,That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.
Pete Disellio,"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline."
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not faffing around.
Ben Wyatt,I've sunk myself into my hobbies.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good."
Ben Wyatt,"So just hang on to your hat, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Here it goes.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how great."
Chris Traeger,Did you pause it?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I hang on."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,That's the whole thing.
Ben Wyatt,That's three weeks of work.
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be okay.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool."
Ben Wyatt,"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?"
Chris Traeger,"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame."
Chris Traeger,But we are going to get through this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann."
Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report."
Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?
April Ludgate,"Perfect, but just one thing."
April Ludgate,It's not a basketball court any more.
April Ludgate,It's an ice skating rink.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happened?
April Ludgate,The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.
April Ludgate,"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?"
Andy Dwyer,"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I got Pistol Pete."
Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?"
Ann Perkins,"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work."
Ann Perkins,"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, the important news is that he's here."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying."
Leslie Knope,He's crying?
Ann Perkins,"No, I was crying."
Ann Perkins,"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term."
Jerry Gergich,"But for the record, I came through."
Jerry Gergich,There are almost a hundred people out there!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to say thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can."
Leslie Knope,"You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar."
Tom Haverford,That would be Hurley's.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's karaoke tonight!"
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, guys."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess."
Ann Perkins,It's our mess.
Ann Perkins,We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.
Tom Haverford,"Or, we go as a team to Hurley's."
Ron Swanson,"No, Ann's right."
Ron Swanson,We're a team.
Ron Swanson,We're all going out together.
Leslie Knope,Let's give this crowd a show.
Ron Swanson,"Go, team!"
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Tom Haverford,Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Everybody smile and wave.
Music,Get up and make it happen get on your feet
April Ludgate,"Stop leaning on my arm, Andy."
Ron Swanson,I'm holding the dog.
Ron Swanson,He is peeing.
Ron Swanson,He is now peeing.
Ron Swanson,I am putting him down.
April Ludgate,"No, Ron, he only has three legs!"
Ann Perkins,Get off me!
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm scared!"
Music,Get up and make it happen
Leslie Knope,Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.
Leslie Knope,How do I get onto the stage? Okay.
Leslie Knope,Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Mm-mm.
Chris Traeger,Here you go.
Chris Traeger,"Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Tastes like a belt.
Chris Traeger,"I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully."
Chris Traeger,"So, tell me."
Chris Traeger,Do you admit that you're depressed?
Ben Wyatt,How did you know? I didn't even know.
Chris Traeger,"The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun."
Chris Traeger,You can't hide these things from friends.
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm feeling better.
Chris Traeger,"Herbal smoothie, you have done it again."
Leslie Knope,"As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry."
Leslie Knope,My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can defeat obese children."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that was something positive, originally."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history."
Leslie Knope,"Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting."
Pete Disellio,"It sure will be! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend! I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope."
Pete Disellio,"She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Pistol Pete!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, we're so happy to have you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,There he goes.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pete! Oh!"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, stay still."
Ann Perkins,Stay down.
Leslie Knope,"Pistol Pete, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Still got it.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how was the rally?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we nailed it!"
Leslie Knope,"No, we didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision."
Ann Perkins,"We've decided to fire the campaign manager, me."
Leslie Knope,And hire you.
Ben Wyatt,But we've talked about this.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
Leslie Knope,This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one that can save us.
Leslie Knope,Please be my campaign manager.
Chris Traeger,"You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be"
Ben Wyatt,I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt,I'm in.
Ben Wyatt,I've done enough exploring.
Ben Wyatt,I'm good.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're fired."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thank God."
April Ludgate,"No, don't make out."
April Ludgate,It's making Champion sad.
Ann Perkins,Surprise! We felt really bad about the whole dredging up your past just to be publically humiliated thing.
Leslie Knope,"So, cookies."
Ann Perkins,And balloons.
Pete Disellio,"Thanks, guys."
Pete Disellio,"It, that's nice."
Ann Perkins,We feel so bad.
Ann Perkins,Is there anything else we can do?
Pete Disellio,You could let me take you to dinner.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann, yes."
Leslie Knope,You should do that.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I can't, though, because I'm married."
Leslie Knope,You're not married.
Leslie Knope,She's not married.
Ann Perkins,This is uncomfortable.
