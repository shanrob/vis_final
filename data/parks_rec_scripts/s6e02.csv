Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're on my team.
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?
Ben Wyatt,It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.
Leslie Knope,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Am I proud of it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Because Eagleton sucks.
Leslie Knope,But is it the classiest move?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,Would I do it again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,"This year, we get to host the Pawnee Eagleton tipoff classic."
Leslie Knope,That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.
Leslie Knope,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.
Leslie Knope,Last year.
Leslie Knope,While she was in office.
Leslie Knope,And pregnant.
Leslie Knope,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard."
Ingrid de Forest,"Ew, pesticide."
Ingrid de Forest,Yuck.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, these are pesticide free."
Leslie Knope,"I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it."
Leslie Knope,"So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now."
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas."
Ingrid de Forest,"If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges."
Ingrid de Forest,"Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck."
Ingrid de Forest,"These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth 700,000 dollars."
Extra,"Leslie, you're down 15 points in the latest poll for the recall election."
Extra,What can you do to make up the deficit?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch."
Leslie Knope,"But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?"""
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,I'll see ya at the game.
Leslie Knope,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store."
Leslie Knope,Knope out.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Who or what is Penny Saver?
Tom Haverford,It's a free circular with a bunch of coupons in it.
Ron Swanson,"This was sent to Ron Swanson at Diane's address, where I've lived for less than a month."
Ron Swanson,How is that possible?
Ron Swanson,This is an extreme invasion of privacy.
Ron Swanson,The right to privacy is very important to me.
Ron Swanson,My family has had a single P.O. box for several generations.
Ron Swanson,"We only ever subscribe to two magazines, Reader's Digest and Ebony."
Ron Swanson,"Ebony was due to a clerical error, but it ended up being an interesting year of reading."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know how this was delivered to me, but it cannot happen again."
Ron Swanson,How can I stop it?
Tom Haverford,Mm.
Tom Haverford,Donna is great with this sort of thing.
Tom Haverford,"She got me off the Williams-Sonoma mailing list, but then I just signed back up again."
Tom Haverford,Hooked on their oven mitts.
Tom Haverford,I need my mitts on those mitts.
Ron Swanson,Let me know the second Donna returns.
Tom Haverford,"According to her Twitter feed, she got coffee five minutes ago."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, now she's Ustreaming her walk back."
Tom Haverford,"She should be here in three, two, one."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, hey."
Tom Haverford,"Hashtag quest for coffee, blowin' up my timeline."
Tom Haverford,You get my snapchat about it?
Donna Meagle,No.
Tom Haverford,What?
Donna Meagle,There it is.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Chris Traeger,I did.
Chris Traeger,Think fast.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Dr. Buttons I mean, my old calculator."
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't have a name.
Ben Wyatt,Why did you throw this at me?
Chris Traeger,"I just got off the phone with our old boss from Indianapolis, and apparently there may be some sort of a budget problem in Eagleton."
Chris Traeger,He asked if maybe you and I wouldn't have a look.
Chris Traeger,You in?
Ben Wyatt,"Butch Countsidy and the Sumdance Kid, together again."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,Auditing bros!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and auditing sistah."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you're coming?"
Leslie Knope,"If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there."
Leslie Knope,That's like a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on."
Leslie Knope,"Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthy type thing, but about Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs, you just might"
Chris Traeger,Be an Eagletonian.
Ann Perkins,Yippee!
Ann Perkins,Road trip!
Ann Perkins,Who's excited to go to Bloomington?
April Ludgate,Is that where you're gonna sit?
Ann Perkins,I'm driving.
Ann Perkins,Where else would I sit?
April Ludgate,Trunk.
Ann Perkins,"I helped April get into vet school in Bloomington and today's her orientation, so we're taking a little road trip."
Ann Perkins,"While I'm there, I'm also gonna pick up an organic baby blanket."
Ann Perkins,"I would get one in Pawnee, but fun fact our only baby store is attached to a chemical refinery."
Ann Perkins,I made a special road trip mix CD for us.
Ann Perkins,I hope you like Tori Amos.
April Ludgate,"Oh, cool."
Leslie Knope,"It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,Say cheese.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,You look beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Can you give us a little more information surrounding the deficits that you're running this year?
Ingrid de Forest,"Ooh, gosh."
Ingrid de Forest,We don't really like to talk about money.
Ingrid de Forest,We find a little gauche.
Ben Wyatt,This is a budget meeting.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, most of our files are in these boxes if you really wanna take a look at how much that we've spent."
Chris Traeger,Why don't we just dig in and see what we're up against?
Ingrid de Forest,Yes.
Ingrid de Forest,And thank you.
Ingrid de Forest,We really appreciate your help.
Ben Wyatt,Are you tipping me?
Leslie Knope,Is that 100 Euros?
Ron Swanson,People ought to have the right to be left alone.
Ron Swanson,I wanna get completely off the grid.
Donna Meagle,That's crazy talk.
Donna Meagle,I live for the grid.
Donna Meagle,It's where I meet 40% of my jumpoffs.
Tom Haverford,"And if you're off the grid, how are you gonna post photos of the dope food at restaurants you're at and all the cool places you're stuntin' in?"
Ron Swanson,Food is for eating.
Ron Swanson,Places are for being.
Ron Swanson,End of discussion.
Tom Haverford,"Don't leave the grid, Ron."
Tom Haverford,The grid is the best.
Tom Haverford,"If anything, you need to get more on the grid."
Tom Haverford,"Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid"
Donna Meagle,"Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid"
Ron Swanson,"If you help me get off the grid, I will let both of you go home early."
Tom Haverford,"No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid."
Donna Meagle,"No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid."
Ann Perkins,"All right, so you have everything you need for orientation?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, an empty Sprite can, an old man's fingernail in my pocket, and a picture of Patrick Ewing on a roller coaster."
April Ludgate,I'm all set.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"My friend here is enrolling in the vet school next month, and she would like to be shown around."
Laura,"Totally, happy to."
Laura,I'm Laura.
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.
Ann Perkins,"So you go with Laura, who seems really nice and does not deserve to be tortured."
Ann Perkins,And I will come meet up with you after I finish at the baby store.
April Ludgate,Sure you wanna leave me here with her?
April Ludgate,What if I'm a murderer?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's funny."
Ben Wyatt,This is worse than I could've imagined.
Ben Wyatt,Their debt to equity ratio is ridonkulous.
Chris Traeger,What a hilarious word.
Chris Traeger,It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.
Chris Traeger,He's the best.
Leslie Knope,What does this mean for them?
Ben Wyatt,"They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money."
Ben Wyatt,Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.
Leslie Knope,Ahh.
Leslie Knope,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Ben Wyatt,"Really, that?"
Leslie Knope,This is gonna hand me the recall election.
Leslie Knope,I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now."
Leslie Knope,You pretend you're Ingrid.
Leslie Knope,Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.
Ben Wyatt,I see where you're going with this.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you're gonna ask me if I like apples"
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Ben Wyatt,"We just watched this movie two nights ago, so"
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Ben Wyatt,I don't wanna do this.
Leslie Knope,How about them apples?
Ron Swanson,"Paul, if you ever see another one of these with my name on it, I want you to drive into the woods and bury it."
Extra,"I don't decide who gets mail, sir."
Extra,I just deliver it.
Ron Swanson,Passing the buck the last refuge of the cowardly and blackhearted.
Extra,That seems harsh.
Ron Swanson,Get out.
Donna Meagle,We got rid of your cell phone.
Donna Meagle,This is your last credit card.
Donna Meagle,Are you sure you want me to cut up this card?
Donna Meagle,It gets you into the parking garage.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be taking the bus now, and I'll be paying in cash."
Ron Swanson,What other traces of me exist in the world?
Ron Swanson,"Think, people."
Tom Haverford,"Isn't there a photo of you up at JJ's Diner, from that time when you aah!"
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Tom!"
Ann Perkins,This place is unbelievable.
Ann Perkins,"It has everything I need: Video monitors, leadfree pacifiers."
Ann Perkins,These are the first bibs I've ever seen without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s face on them.
Extra,Really?
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,"Excuse me, sorry."
Ann Perkins,"April, why aren't you at orientation?"
April Ludgate,"Um, I was at orientation, but it was lame, so I left."
April Ludgate,"And then I kept walking, and now here I am."
Ann Perkins,"We are going back there right now, young lady."
April Ludgate,Mmmm.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
April Ludgate,"God, get off me, stranger."
Ingrid de Forest,I'm so sorry we're late.
Ingrid de Forest,We came from our bankruptcy brunch.
Ingrid de Forest,"And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long."
Chris Traeger,I love Michael Buble.
Ben Wyatt,Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?
Ingrid de Forest,"Sure, let's not have brunch like animals."
Chris Traeger,"Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable."
Chris Traeger,"Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?"
Ingrid de Forest,Total body hydration.
Ben Wyatt,What is this here?
Ben Wyatt,This massive expenditure from public works?
Ingrid de Forest,"Ah, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,We purchased HBO for the whole town.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,You spent government money on a TV subscription?
Ingrid de Forest,It's not TV.
Chris Traeger,Alright.
Chris Traeger,"Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery."
Ingrid de Forest,Great.
Leslie Knope,You may find it very informative.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started with our first slide.
Leslie Knope,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Ron Swanson,"JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs."
Ron Swanson,"They were delicious, so I ordered more."
Ron Swanson,"Before long, I believe I had eaten"
JJ,51 eggs in 20 minutes.
JJ,Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.
JJ,The last ten were still in the shell.
Tom Haverford,"It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture."
Tom Haverford,"Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons."
JJ,"Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you."
JJ,We followed your instructions.
Ron Swanson,That's too much information.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Where are we going now?
Ron Swanson,I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.
Ron Swanson,Why is everyone else so bad at eating?
April Ludgate,I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.
April Ludgate,Do you promise to play along?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
April Ludgate,Do you?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Laura,"Hi, you're back."
April Ludgate,Hello again.
April Ludgate,"As you remember, I'm April, and this is Ann, my 65 year old grandmother."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's who I am."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington."
Ann Perkins,It seems like a real hip kind of college town.
April Ludgate,"Meemaw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore."
April Ludgate,Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.
Laura,I would be happy to show you guys around the campus.
Laura,Is there anything in particular that you wanna see?
April Ludgate,How are your local graveyards?
April Ludgate,I have some planning to do.
Leslie Knope,"""You blew it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Super hard."""
Leslie Knope,"""Complete buffoonery."""
Leslie Knope,"""It's hilarious."""
Leslie Knope,"And ""You deserve it."""
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?"
Ben Wyatt,That was 200 years ago.
Ben Wyatt,Cool it.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'll skip ahead.
Ingrid de Forest,Do you have a plan that will help us or not?
Ingrid de Forest,We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.
Ingrid de Forest,"And really, Pawnee is our only hope."
Leslie Knope,We do have a plan.
Leslie Knope,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"25% interest, compounded monthly."
Leslie Knope,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, now you're just being nasty."
Ingrid de Forest,"I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton ""You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux."""
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, blondie."
Leslie Knope,"Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it."
Leslie Knope,"And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,They have Michael Buble on retainer.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, all public photos of me recovered."
Ron Swanson,Nameplate removed from my office door.
Ron Swanson,Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.
Ron Swanson,Anything I'm missing?
Tom Haverford,"Great news, Ron."
Tom Haverford,JeanRalphio loves your shirt.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I've been taking pictures of you all day for my new Facebook album: ""Ron Swan: Gettin' off the grid."""
Ron Swanson,"Tom, do you maybe see a problem with what you've done?"
Tom Haverford,I do now.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sorry."
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,What the hell is happening?
Tom Haverford,I think you accidentally opened up Vine.
Tom Haverford,"You just vined your first selfie, Ron."
Donna Meagle,And I'm vining you vine your selfie.
Ron Swanson,The world is a nightmare.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Tom Haverford,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Donna Meagle,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Laura,The Bline is a cool outdoor trail that cuts right through downtown.
April Ludgate,"She said the Bline is cool, Meemaw."
April Ludgate,Cool means good.
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Laura, for showing us around."
Laura,Sure.
Laura,"See you in a couple weeks, April."
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,This place is great.
Ann Perkins,Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,It was pointless.
April Ludgate,I'm not going to school here.
Ann Perkins,"April, don't flake out on this."
Ann Perkins,You're gonna love it here.
Ann Perkins,Bloomington is great.
Ann Perkins,It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.
Ann Perkins,Youngsters?
Ann Perkins,Am I 65 years old?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm not going here."
April Ludgate,I don't want to.
April Ludgate,Let's leave.
Leslie Knope,Think fast.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?
Chris Traeger,"""Eagleton: No money, mo' problems."""
Leslie Knope,"Fantastic, right?"
Leslie Knope,I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.
Chris Traeger,I do like a good internal rhyme.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you ready for dinner?"
Leslie Knope,We can go over the poll numbers.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh you know, I've got a few phone calls to make."
Ben Wyatt,Can you give me an hour?
Leslie Knope,I can meet you there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is she doing here?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice."
Ingrid de Forest,You didn't actually help us at all.
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ingrid de Forest,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just gonna help them out, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,Just for an hour.
Ingrid de Forest,He's just being a good neighbor.
Ingrid de Forest,"We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"I don't need any lip from you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.
Ingrid de Forest,I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Wearing Chanel suits?
Ingrid de Forest,"There was a fashion component, yes."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad that you're doing this.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this."
Leslie Knope,"But even worse, I'm mad that you just lied to me about it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever."
Ben Wyatt,I never said that.
Ben Wyatt,You did.
Leslie Knope,I speak for all of us in all matters.
Leslie Knope,That is what you tacitly agreed to when you married me.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's go."
Leslie Knope,You've changed your mind.
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna help her anymore.
Ingrid de Forest,"Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening."
Ann Perkins,Can we please talk about what happened back there?
April Ludgate,"What, Ann?"
April Ludgate,I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.
April Ludgate,It's not that big of a deal.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future."
Ann Perkins,And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?"
April Ludgate,I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.
April Ludgate,"And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all."
Ann Perkins,"So, just like that, boom huge life decision made?"
April Ludgate,That's how I make all my life decisions.
April Ludgate,"My gut is always right, okay?"
April Ludgate,"It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life."
April Ludgate,"And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann."
April Ludgate,So gross!
Ann Perkins,How do you get your gut to talk to you?
April Ludgate,You don't get your gut to talk to you.
April Ludgate,You just listen when it says something.
Ann Perkins,"Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home."
April Ludgate,Good.
Leslie Knope,Whoa.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I'm just trying to help them."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at this guy."
Leslie Knope,There's no way he is in high school.
Extra,"And I'm better at French horn too, Eric."
Ben Wyatt,"People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,And the recovery will take years.
Ben Wyatt,"Deep down, I think you feel bad for them."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I do a little, yes."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't."
Ben Wyatt,I'm always gonna be on your team.
Ben Wyatt,You never have to worry about that.
Extra,Defense!
Extra,"Oh! Eagleton player number seven, injured on the play."
Extra,Official time-out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say something.
Leslie Knope,"And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned."
Leslie Knope,I know how we can help Eagleton.
Ron Swanson,I don't see what the problem is.
Ron Swanson,I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle.
Extra,I still need an address for insurance purposes.
Ron Swanson,This will be my new home.
Ron Swanson,The address is wherever it is parked.
Diane Lewis,"Where have you been? I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours."
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, darling."
Ron Swanson,I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.
Diane Lewis,"Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now."
Diane Lewis,You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find.
Ron Swanson,I'm on a mission to get off the grid.
Diane Lewis,"Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid."
Ron Swanson,I suppose you wouldn't consider moving.
Ron Swanson,I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.
Diane Lewis,"I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain."
Ron Swanson,I love you too.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt,"Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this? A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election."
Leslie Knope,"Or, if I pull it off, I just might win."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis."
Leslie Knope,The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do."
Leslie Knope,I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.
Chris Traeger,We looked at every alternative.
Chris Traeger,This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region.
Chance Frenlm,Eagleton is terrible! Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check?
Extra,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.
Leslie Knope,"And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court."
Leslie Knope,"I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them."
Herman Lerpiss,I got something to say.
Leslie Knope,"One at a time, please."
Mel,I hate the one-at-a-time system!
Herman Lerpiss,Why should we bail them out? No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson.
Extra,You can't just merge two towns.
Extra,It's against the rules of nature.
Extra,What's next-- merging a man with his dog?
Bertram Rolands,I live in Eagleton.
Bertram Rolands,"And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee."
Bertram Rolands,"They're a little-- oh, what's the word? Have-no-money."
Ingrid de Forest,"Bertram, that's enough."
Ingrid de Forest,"First of all, Eagleton has no money."
Ingrid de Forest,"Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity."
Ingrid de Forest,"They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll take it."
Donna Meagle,"I mean, did you steal this from a museum?"
Donna Meagle,Maybe find it frozen in ice?
Donna Meagle,It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street.
Tom Haverford,"I think it's just the original phone, period."
Tom Haverford,"Ew, gross, it has ""buttons."""
Diane Lewis,"Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay? Only you and I have got the numbers."
Diane Lewis,"So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will."
Ron Swanson,I'll keep it right here.
Ron Swanson,"It snaps right in, snug and secure."
Tom Haverford,"A cell phone belt clip? No, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I can't be seen with you."
Chris Traeger,Travelin' Ann Perkins! How was Bloomington?
Ann Perkins,It was amazing.
Ann Perkins,"They had all the baby supplies we need, and they had all this other cool stuff."
Ann Perkins,"They had a bike-sharing program and a vegan Afghan restaurant and-- Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I'm having one.
Ann Perkins,- I'm having one right now.
Chris Traeger,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I'm, like, three months pregnant."
Chris Traeger,I-I know.
Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.
Ann Perkins,The thing I'm having is a gut feeling.
Ann Perkins,What would you think about raising our child somewhere other than Pawnee?
Ingrid de Forest,"Thank you, Leslie, from all of us in Eagleton."
Ingrid de Forest,Our citizens owe you a debt of gratitude.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do."
Ingrid de Forest,"On the bright side, we did win the basketball game."
Ingrid de Forest,I think you owe us some apples.
Ingrid de Forest,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"- Oh, you don't want them."
Leslie Knope,All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g. coli.
Ingrid de Forest,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,I wish.
Leslie Knope,Way easier to treat.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Pawnee!
