Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just do it then.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married.
Ben Wyatt,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,Are we really doing this?
Ben Wyatt,I guess
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,The gala ends at 11:00.
Ben Wyatt,"At 11:01, we get married."
Leslie Knope,"Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here."
Leslie Knope,And your parents aren't here.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that makes it better."
Leslie Knope,But we reserved a space for May 16th.
Leslie Knope,And we just ordered 200 white chocolate top hats.
Ben Wyatt,We did?
Leslie Knope,"You did, actually."
Leslie Knope,It's under your name.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can get married May 16th, or June 1st, or July 57th."
Ben Wyatt,"But doesn't it feel right, today?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it does."
Leslie Knope,"Every time you say it, it just feels more right."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight."
Leslie Knope,This is really great.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"You're either in or your out, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"it was my idea, I'm totally in."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,We can't this is our wedding day.
Leslie Knope,"This is very bad luck, turn around."
Leslie Knope,We can't look at each other!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you are aware that we've seen each other several times today."
Leslie Knope,We have two hours to do this.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wait, before we get married, there is something we need to discuss."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we've never talked about it, but I really want you to take my last name."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's just really important to me, symbolically, that Leslie Knope disappears and becomes Leslie Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,Or Councilwoman Mrs. Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,That's fine too.
Ben Wyatt,It's a deal breaker.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, are you messing with me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I had to give it a shot."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, now go, run!"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Where do I go?
Leslie Knope,Run!
Ben Wyatt,The falcon is entering!
Leslie Knope,The turtledove acknowledges!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where are you?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm I'm here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go over the duties right now."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup."
Leslie Knope,"And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl."
Ann Perkins,Piece of cake.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, we have to get the wedding cake."
Ann Perkins,I'll do that too.
Ann Perkins,I'm perfectly calm.
Ann Perkins,"I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing."
Ann Perkins,"I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Who is crazy.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, we need rings and marriage licenses."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, let me be on rings."
Chris Traeger,I love what they symbolize.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,And I can do the license.
Andy Dwyer,I got a guy that works at City Hall.
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my wife.
April Ludgate,"Um, you also work there."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle."
Ron Swanson,"It would be an honor, and the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh, yikes."
Ben Wyatt,We need an officiant.
Tom Haverford,I got this.
Tom Haverford,"You can become an ordained minister online in, like, five minutes."
Tom Haverford,Do you want more like a Steve Harvey vibe or straight up Seacrest?
Tom Haverford,Nuh!
Tom Haverford,Never mind.
Tom Haverford,I'll combine 'em Stevecrest.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.
Leslie Knope,I love all of you.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, break!"
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,We're looking for a couple wedding rings.
Herman,You're gonna wanna look through the jewelry and nails tray.
Herman,There is some beautiful jewelry in here.
Herman,But be careful.
Herman,There's also nails.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, these aren't bad."
Herman,Those are real nice.
Herman,"And they were nipple rings, at one point."
Ben Wyatt,How do you know that?
Herman,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,They were yours.
Ben Wyatt,They were his.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, it's pretty crazy, I'm gonna be a cop tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,I guess I better commit as many crimes as possible tonight.
Andy Dwyer,Get it out of my system.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, found the marriage licenses."
April Ludgate,And I am going to take all of them.
April Ludgate,"I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for us."
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I'm good!
Leslie Knope,It's not finished.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't the seamstress finish it?
Leslie Knope,"If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job."
Ann Perkins,There's got to be something we can do.
Leslie Knope,This wedding is meant to be.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna figure it out.
Leslie Knope,Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?
Leslie Knope,Squirrels and birds.
Ann Perkins,Mm.
Leslie Knope,That's not very helpful.
Ann Perkins,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, we got it!"
April Ludgate,We got it.
Andy Dwyer,Marriage license done.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, hold on."
Leslie Knope,It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.
April Ludgate,I'll just forge it.
April Ludgate,I forge government documents all the time.
Andy Dwyer,That's true.
April Ludgate,Boom.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,So we didn't find any rings.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here."
Leslie Knope,Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.
Ben Wyatt,Don't panic.
Ben Wyatt,I swear there's some rings in this old box of stuff my mom gave me.
Ben Wyatt,Still here at April and Andy's house.
Ben Wyatt,Want to come help me look?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ann, dress duty."
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, license duty."
Leslie Knope,No time for verbs.
Andy Dwyer,"I know you're in a rush, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"I should point out that you said ""duty"" twice."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Donna Meagle,"Aw, shucks, business is boomin'."
Jerry Gergich,Indiana celebrity lookalikes.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, this is a brilliant idea, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,All my favorites are here.
Jerry Gergich,"We got Orville Redenbacher, La Toya Jackson, Axl Rose, David Letterman."
Donna Meagle,"Look, don't tell anyone, but I booked a special surprise."
Donna Meagle,There's a Li'l Sebastian lookalike on the way what?
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my Oh!"
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Did you just pee your pants?
Jerry Gergich,Just a dab.
Jerry Gergich,I better go clean up.
Donna Meagle,"You nasty, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Third time this week.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what the hell!"
Jerry Gergich,What's wrong?
Tom Haverford,"""Your Minister Certification will be emailed to you in 24 hours."""
Tom Haverford,Uhh!
Tom Haverford,But this is America.
Tom Haverford,I want it now!
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, Tom, that's what happens."
Tom Haverford,I had all these great bits written for the wedding too.
Tom Haverford,I was gonna beatbox.
Tom Haverford,There's a dance breakdown.
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking, like, six guaranteed applause breaks."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, you know, I am actually ordained."
Jerry Gergich,I could do the wedding.
Tom Haverford,That's the worst idea I've ever heard.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, you're right, okay."
Tom Haverford,Wait!
Tom Haverford,"What if you do the ceremony, but you don't have any stupid ideas of your own, and you just say the stuff that I came up with?"
Jerry Gergich,Anything to help Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,Now shut up and start memorizing.
Tom Haverford,We open with Will Smith's monologue from the modern cinematic classic Hitch.
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove?
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Leslie Knope,There's your butt.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Did you find the rings?
Ben Wyatt,"No rings, just a tennis bracelet and a necklace that says ""Wine Chick."""
Leslie Knope,"No rings, no license, no dress."
Leslie Knope,"This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, it's snowing."
Leslie Knope,It's him.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Ben Wyatt,I can't see.
Leslie Knope,"I don't understand, this is impossible."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Li'l Sebastian?
Extra,"No, no, sorry."
Extra,"Actually, this is Bucky."
Extra,"He's a, uh, licensed Li'l Sebastian impersonator."
Extra,"We're headed to the gala, so folks can pose for pictures with him."
Extra,"200 a pop, if you're interested."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, you."
Leslie Knope,"This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do this.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna pull this wedding off.
Extra,"Come on, Bucky."
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Extra,"Yes, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, we're running out of time."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch."
Leslie Knope,"Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options."
Ann Perkins,"I have an idea, and it might be insane, but I've been watching a lot Project Runway recently In the past eight years."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work."
Leslie Knope,No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I talking about?"
Leslie Knope,There's always time.
Leslie Knope,"Designers, make it work."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you have less than an hour."
Andy Dwyer,"Miss Beavers, this is official police business."
Andy Dwyer,I hope we didn't wake you up.
Ethel Beavers,It's after 10:00.
Ethel Beavers,I've been asleep for four hours.
Ethel Beavers,What do you want?
April Ludgate,We need you to sign this.
April Ludgate,It's a marriage license.
Extra,Ethel?
Extra,Is it robbers?
Ethel Beavers,"No, go back to bed."
Andy Dwyer,"Aww, is that your husband?"
Ethel Beavers,I'm not married.
Ethel Beavers,I was on a date tonight.
Ethel Beavers,"It went well, he's sleeping over."
April Ludgate,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,It'd really mean a lot if you sign it.
Andy Dwyer,It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.
Andy Dwyer,I think you know them?
Ethel Beavers,"They dragged me out in the freezing cold once, so they could tell each other ""I love you."""
Ethel Beavers,It was annoying.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank you so much!"
Andy Dwyer,You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown and seem to be super good at dating.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?"
Ethel Beavers,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,Cool!
Andy Dwyer,"We love you, Grandma!"
Ben Wyatt,"I guess we could go to a pharmacy, but I really don't want to use like a cheap plastic ring."
Chris Traeger,"I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings."
Chris Traeger,What what is this?
Chris Traeger,It's a toe ring with a brown gemstone?
Chris Traeger,Is this a ruby that's gone bad?
Ben Wyatt,I am out of ideas.
Ben Wyatt,Jewelry store.
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's closed, that's why we're doing this."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps I can be of service.
Ben Wyatt,How?
Ron Swanson,How much do you think Ann would miss this sconce?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,It's part of her house.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, okay."
Jerry Gergich,"""When I heard Ben was getting married, I was like, 'to Leslie or to Game of Thrones'?"""
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, horrible delivery."
Jerry Gergich,"""You ever heard Leslie talk about Ben's butt?"""
Jerry Gergich,"""I'm all like, 'damn, girl, you mad sweet on that back meat."""
Tom Haverford,You're murdering my beautiful words!
Tom Haverford,Do you even want to kill at this wedding?
Jerry Gergich,I just want Leslie and Ben to have a nice night.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"I No, no."
Tom Haverford,It's my fault for believing in you.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, look, um, to be official, I just have to do the vows and the pronouncement."
Jerry Gergich,"So why don't you handle the speech, and then I'll just come in at the end?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm not crazy about the part where you do something."
Tom Haverford,"But, I do like the idea me doing something."
Tom Haverford,Let's give it a shot.
Donna Meagle,"Hello, everyone."
Donna Meagle,Got some bad news.
Donna Meagle,The gala ends at 11:00.
Donna Meagle,"The good news is, at 11:01, we'll be holding a special wedding ceremony."
Donna Meagle,Everyone is invited to stay.
Donna Meagle,All the drinks and the food will be on us.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everything going okay?"
Donna Meagle,Everything would be peachy if it weren't for that dumbass with a megaphone.
Jeremy Jamm,No one wants a park here.
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, butterteeth, what's up?"
Jeremy Jamm,I can fix those chompers for you.
Jeremy Jamm,Just come to Jamm Orthodontics.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?"
Jeremy Jamm,What are you doing here?
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, enough."
Jeremy Jamm,You better give me back that megaphone.
Jeremy Jamm,That belongs to my aunt.
Leslie Knope,Why don't I call you a cab?
Jeremy Jamm,Mm.
Jeremy Jamm,"No, this isn't over, Knope."
Leslie Knope,It is over.
Leslie Knope,I won fair and square.
Leslie Knope,"And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world."
Leslie Knope,And all my dreams are coming true.
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm Councilman Howser."
Councilman Howser,Leslie.
Councilman Howser,Jeremy.
Jeremy Jamm,You better make sure my aunt gets her megaphone back.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, did I did I do it right?"
Ben Wyatt,How's it look?
Chris Traeger,Terrible.
Chris Traeger,And perfect.
Chris Traeger,I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight.
Chris Traeger,And I have already broken that promise five times.
Chris Traeger,But I will not break it a sixth.
Ben Wyatt,"Go ahead and let it out, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Chris Traeger,I have something for you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Chris Traeger,It is the letter from the statehouse Telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,"Dated may 1st, 2010."
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Chris Traeger,We were supposed to be here eight weeks.
Chris Traeger,"I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home."
Ben Wyatt,"Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me."
Chris Traeger,"It's okay, buddy, let it out."
Ann Perkins,"I gathered up all the meaningful bills, pictures, documents, and memos from your career."
Ann Perkins,What do you think?
Ann Perkins,Is it okay?
Leslie Knope,It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope,It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.
Ann Perkins,Yay.
Ann Perkins,It is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,All set.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Ann Perkins,Right?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
April Ludgate,"No, that's the groom"
Andy Dwyer,I ruined it!
April Ludgate,"Andy, that's the groom."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I saw him too."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm just gonna cover my eyes, just to be safe."
April Ludgate,"Okay, so we're ready out there."
April Ludgate,For your wedding or whatever.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?"
April Ludgate,"Yes, it all came together."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, Leslie Knope, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Here comes the boo all dressed in boo boo, Leslie Knope boo, boooooooo Boo!"
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm being awesome.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo, Leslie, boo."
Ron Swanson,"My friend, I don't think you understand what a bad idea this is."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think you understand that I would have got a cut of that new Paunch Burger if she hadn't screwed everything up.
Jeremy Jamm,"So sorry, guys!"
Jeremy Jamm,"This wedding is canceled, 'cause the bride is a bhole."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,Check this out.
Jeremy Jamm,Stink bomb!
Jeremy Jamm,Who knows what that does?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Stink bomb?
Ann Perkins,Are you joking?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where did you even get a stink bomb?
Jeremy Jamm,"Amazon, baby, that's how."
Jeremy Jamm,"You are looking at a prime customer, everybody."
Jeremy Jamm,Two days free shipping for this guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's get this party started with another one, gang!"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Tom Haverford,It's terrible!
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, you do the wedding."
Tom Haverford,Who cares?
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man, just go home."
Jeremy Jamm,And who's gonna make me?
Ron Swanson,It's your wedding day.
Ron Swanson,I'll handle this.
Jeremy Jamm,Here comes the bride.
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, get off me, what the hell, man?"
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you touch me.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,I'll give you that one.
Ron Swanson,But if you do it again
Jeremy Jamm,If I do what again?
Jeremy Jamm,"What, kick your ass?"
Jeremy Jamm,Is that what you like?
Jeremy Jamm,You want me to just pound
Ben Wyatt,Ooh!
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
April Ludgate,"Yay, best wedding ever."
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
Jeremy Jamm,You broke my tooth.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good thing you're an orthodontist."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it is a good thing."
Jeremy Jamm,You see my house?
Jeremy Jamm,Five bathrooms.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,For what?
Ron Swanson,"I've never presented a bride on her wedding day, so I'm not 100% sure of the duties involved, but I don't think you're supposed to punch a man in the mouth during the service."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerk face."
Ron Swanson,"Well, please, don't worry about me."
Ron Swanson,Just go and get married.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Listen to me very carefully.
Leslie Knope,"I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back."
Leslie Knope,So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.
Leslie Knope,End of discussion.
Andy Dwyer,"Better get used to this, honey."
Andy Dwyer,Gonna be a lot of late nights for me here.
Andy Dwyer,Graveyard shift.
Andy Dwyer,You coming to bring me coffee while I interrogate murderers.
April Ludgate,"You've had all night to get something out of him, Dwyer, we gotta let him go."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Captain."
Andy Dwyer,I'm this close to getting a confession.
April Ludgate,"You're never gonna break him, Dwyer."
April Ludgate,He's a psychopath.
April Ludgate,"He chopped off both of his arms, so he wouldn't leave any fingerprints."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he did?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, how did he murder the person?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Chief Fugleberg."
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy Dwyer, pre reporting for duty."
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, about my new partner."
Andy Dwyer,Is it a dog?
Chief Fugleberg,"Oh, has Chris Traeger not told you?"
Andy Dwyer,Told me what?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron, we posted bail."
Ann Perkins,You're free to go.
Jeremy Jamm,"Wait a minute, what? He punched me in the teeth."
Jeremy Jamm,This is an outrage.
Extra,I think we have a pretty clear picture of what went down.
Extra,"Sleep it off in the cell, Councilman."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm so sorry."
Ann Perkins,I think we missed it.
Ann Perkins,"The gala's over, they're taking it all down."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all."
Leslie Knope,We'll get married in May like we planned.
Ann Perkins,"You know what? I have some champagne, back at the office."
Ann Perkins,"Let's go back there, have a drink, toast to Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,Fun.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,"It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on."
Jeremy Jamm,I got five bathrooms.
Leslie Knope,I love the first floor of City Hall at night.
Leslie Knope,When all the fluorescents are half-off.
Leslie Knope,Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,I've never willingly been here later than 5:04 p.m.
Ron Swanson,"Before we go inside, I'd like to say something."
Ron Swanson,You are a wonderful person.
Ron Swanson,Your friendship means a lot to me.
Ron Swanson,And you look very beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Hoo, boy."
Ron Swanson,All set?
Tom Haverford,"Mmhmm Jerry, everything I wrote is wrong."
Tom Haverford,"There's, like, 20 minutes of Hitch quotes before I even say Leslie's name."
Tom Haverford,What do I do?
Jerry Gergich,"You know what, Tom? Just speak from the heart, okay? You'll do great."
Tom Haverford,We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.
Tom Haverford,It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds.
Tom Haverford,And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.
Tom Haverford,"So I say, let's keep it short and sweet."
April Ludgate,"Yes, just do it already."
Tom Haverford,"I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows? Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie?"
Ben Wyatt,"In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years."
Ben Wyatt,"I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns."
Ben Wyatt,I was sent to every corner of Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,And then I came here.
Ben Wyatt,"And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages."
Leslie Knope,But I don't have them with me today.
Leslie Knope,Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.
April Ludgate,No.
Ben Wyatt,"That's fine, that's fine."
Ben Wyatt,I think we can just keep going.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Here's what I'll say, then."
Leslie Knope,"The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves."
Leslie Knope,You're all I need.
Leslie Knope,I love you and I like you.
Ben Wyatt,I love you and I like you.
Jerry Gergich,"And now, with the power vested in me by the state of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Jerry Gergich,"You may now kiss the well, oops, okay."
Ron Swanson,Lagavulin all around? Don't bother answering.
Ron Swanson,I am already pouring.
Ron Swanson,You don't have to drink yours.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Just this once, I thought I nailed something."
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm still proud of you."
April Ludgate,You worked hard and you got really close.
Andy Dwyer,Close only counts in horse grenades.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,It's a saying.
Andy Dwyer,"Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off."
Andy Dwyer,It's from the movie Seabiscuit.
Chris Traeger,How's it going in here?
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, this is a very important moment for you."
Chris Traeger,How we deal with tragedy defines who we are.
Chris Traeger,I used to be terrible at it.
Chris Traeger,Beyond terrible.
Chris Traeger,You are not going to let this deflate you.
Chris Traeger,"You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is."
Ann Perkins,Chris can be very Paternal.
Andy Dwyer,I look around this room.
Andy Dwyer,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here."
Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you."
Donna Meagle,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing you trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said good-bye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly"
Andy Dwyer,"Bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian, miss you in the saddest fashion"
Leslie Knope,There were a lot of signs that Ben and I miss you in the saddest fashion should get married tonight.
Leslie Knope,"But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married."
Leslie Knope,"When you're in love, everything seems like a sign."
Leslie Knope,I love my husband.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,And I love my friends.
Leslie Knope,Even though they really can't handle their booze.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should just go, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Careful.
Andy Dwyer,Spread your wings and fly spread your wings and fly
Ron Swanson,It's not rocket science.
