Leslie Knope,"I mean, I love him."
Leslie Knope,"It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben into grumpy, stressball Ben."

Linda Lonegan,"I don't consider myself an anythingist, but my life has been shaped by powerful women."
Linda Lonegan,"My father once told my mother that woman was made from the rib of Adam, and my mom broke his jaw."
Linda Lonegan,My Uncle Lon once tried to

Buddy Wood,"Leslie, welcome to Good Morning."
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for being on my show.
Buddy Wood,"Leslie, we're here at the Pawnee municipal airport, which I must add is rather decrepit."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad you mentioned it."
Leslie Knope,It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece of my platform.
Buddy Wood,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there."
Leslie Knope,"Joe, say hi."
Extra,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel."
Leslie Knope,I am gonna work very hard to change
Buddy Wood,"Okay, this airport seems to me like a metaphor."
Buddy Wood,Are you familiar with the term?
Buddy Wood,"Pawnee's airport is symbolic of the town out of touch, out of date, perhaps, lost, insignificant, and sad."
Buddy Wood,Your thoughts?
Leslie Knope,"Well, granted, we don't have big city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and handworking hards hardworking hands."
Buddy Wood,If you say so.
Buddy Wood,I say it's sad.
Buddy Wood,Moving on
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"If they got together, they would make the most beautiful super baby."
Andy Dwyer,It would rule us all.
Andy Dwyer,But what if super baby became too powerful?
April Ludgate,I guess we'll just have to take that chance.
April Ludgate,Chris got dumped by Jerry's daughter.
April Ludgate,He needs this.
April Ludgate,"Plus, if they get married, he'll spend all his time with her, and I might never have to talk to him again."
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,"Professor Linda, you have Really nice arms."
Linda Lonegan,Oh?
April Ludgate,Do you work out?
Chris Traeger,I was gonna say the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger,But I didn't want you to think that I was objectifying you with my male gaze.
Chris Traeger,May I see?
Linda Lonegan,"Oh, sure."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my good gracious."
Chris Traeger,You have extraordinary caput laterale.
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,There's nothing more important than physical health.
Linda Lonegan,I agree.
Ron Swanson,Kendra?
Extra,Yes?
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,I am gonna have that third steak after all.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead and put that order in now, please, and thank you."
Buddy Wood,"Your campaign hit a snag of sorts, with the revelation that you and your boss, Ben Wyatt, were having une affaire de coeur affair of the heart."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say."
Leslie Knope,I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Buddy Wood,Good luck with that.
Buddy Wood,"But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager"
Leslie Knope,"Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that."
Leslie Knope,"But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks."
Buddy Wood,I don't.
Buddy Wood,I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Ann Perkins,I know that look.
Tom Haverford,She's got the crazy eyes.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,"I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and I first
Buddy Wood,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, are you inebriated?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Preposterous.
Leslie Knope,Are you inebriated?
Leslie Knope,That was bad timing.
Buddy Wood,"This is a Buddy Wood first an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera."
Leslie Knope,I am not drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk."
Buddy Wood,"Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way?"
Leslie Knope,This interview is over.
Buddy Wood,"Okay, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,Oh This this is not because I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,This is because of the wire.
Buddy Wood,"A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign."
Leslie Knope,"C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape."
Buddy Wood,Are you kidding?
Buddy Wood,This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.
Buddy Wood,The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.
Buddy Wood,Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often
Leslie Knope,"I know what tiramisu is, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And sheep don't eat it.
Buddy Wood,"Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indianasphere."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for celebrating the most ultimate triumph of my life.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm very proud of me, and you are too."
Andy Dwyer,"And, Professor, I'm taking your class again next semester."
Andy Dwyer,And I'm gonna lock down that P plus.
Linda Lonegan,It's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,You and the women taught me that nothing is impossible.
Chris Traeger,"Alright, I better be going."
Chris Traeger,I have to get up early.
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.
Chris Traeger,"Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking?"
Chris Traeger,It's quite fun.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's more grueling than fun."
Chris Traeger,But I would love to take you.
Linda Lonegan,"I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything."
Chris Traeger,Of course.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Linda Lonegan,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,I appreciate your caution.
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,I hope to see you again.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?
Linda Lonegan,Or how about you and I go back to my place?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I am so sorry."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just focus on the problem.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead."
Ben Wyatt,So We have to go to Indianapolis.
Tom Haverford,And do what?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, that's so sweet I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before."
Donna Meagle,"Ah, it gets old."
Tom Haverford,We still have six hours of rental time on the hot tub limo.
Tom Haverford,We could take that.
Tom Haverford,No one would have to drive all night.
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good idea.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, it allows for the possibility of high speed skinny dipping."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I was joking."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, it was a joke."
Ann Perkins,It was funny.
Extra,"Where we going, folks drive around, hit the strip clubs?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to this address in Indianapolis.
Extra,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Extra,"You know, no one ever used this hottub limo for actual transportation."
Extra,"And I can't take this thing on the highway, so it'll take a few extra hours."
Extra,"Hey, is this a seven or a one?"
Donna Meagle,Jerry.
Donna Meagle,Jerry!
Donna Meagle,Maybe you should wrap it up.
Donna Meagle,It's 4:00 in the morning.
Jerry Gergich,Is it really?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that flew by, huh? I will just take these down to the post office and, uh, put the, uh Oh, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, no."
Jerry Gergich,"I put the handout flyers in the mailing envelopes, and I was supposed to put these flyers in the envelopes."
Donna Meagle,Oh My God.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, you know, it's like I always say."
Jerry Gergich,It ain't government work if you don't have to do it twice.
Jerry Gergich,Here we go!
Donna Meagle,I'll make some coffee.
Buddy Wood,"Hey, you're blocking my driveway."
Buddy Wood,Leslie Knope? - What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"We, oh, my God, I can't see."
Leslie Knope,It's so bright out here.
Ben Wyatt,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,"We drove here to ask you, No, to beg you to please destroy that tape."
Buddy Wood,"Yeah, I got your 50 messages."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.
Buddy Wood,What?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,That's five pleases.
Buddy Wood,"As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Buddy Wood,"You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not."
Buddy Wood,Completely ruined a great story.
Buddy Wood,Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,"God, that's"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Uh We should yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We're gonna go.
Leslie Knope,Goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, screw it."
Leslie Knope,Yay! Fun Ben lives.
Ron Swanson,"April, Andrew Good morning to you both."
Ron Swanson,"Doughnuts, go nuts."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, you kids need any money?"
April Ludgate,No.
Ron Swanson,Go buy yourself a Walkman.
Ron Swanson,How much is a Walkman nowadays? Probably more than $20.
Ron Swanson,Here's $25.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening."
Chris Traeger,And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.
Chris Traeger,I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.
Chris Traeger,So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ron Great red shirt."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Ron you have to tell him what happened."
Ron Swanson,Why? It's none of his business.
April Ludgate,Because he's been super sad lately.
April Ludgate,It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.
Ron Swanson,I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations."
Andy Dwyer,We face them head-on.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that."
Andy Dwyer,That's crazy.
Chris Traeger,There's that shirt.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda."
Chris Traeger,I see.
Ron Swanson,I didn't plan it.
Ron Swanson,But it occurred.
Ron Swanson,Now you know.
Chris Traeger,"Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me."
Chris Traeger,"You're a good man, Ron."
Chris Traeger,I'm quite lonely.
Ron Swanson,"Ah, [Bleep]."
Leslie Knope,"They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope,I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
Leslie Knope,And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
Leslie Knope,And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
Leslie Knope,I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, not all of it."
Leslie Knope,He's about to get lucky.
Leslie Knope,"It's, it's on."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't even know it yet.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford,"I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record."
Ann Perkins,That's not bad.
Tom Haverford,To celebrate
Ann Perkins,"Oh, please, don't."
Ann Perkins,"Whatever this is, I don't want it."
Tom Haverford,Just a little 48 hour anniversary gift.
Ann Perkins,Condoms.
Tom Haverford,48 of 'em.
Tom Haverford,Different flavor for each hour.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we're not dating any more, okay? Get out."
