Extra,"This is ""The Final Word with Perd."""
Extra,"With your host, Perderick L."
Extra,Hapley.
Perd Hapley,Issue number one is the first issue we're going to talk about.
Perd Hapley,Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble?
Perd Hapley,"When I say your names, I want you to respond."
Perd Hapley,Dylan.
Extra,"Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting."
Extra,"They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby?"
Extra,He's on vacation in Spain.
Extra,"He's not on vacation, he's in hiding."
Extra,"Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth."
Perd Hapley,That's a hilarious image.
Perd Hapley,A foot in a mouth.
Extra,It's a common expression.
Perd Hapley,Okay.
Perd Hapley,"According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place."
Perd Hapley,She's just 15 points back.
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, yeah!"
Perd Hapley,How did she close the gap?
Extra,"You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass."
Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.
Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird."
Ben Wyatt,What did you just say?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Ben Wyatt,"Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote."
Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones."
Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.
Ben Wyatt,He's like The Grandfather.
Ben Wyatt,The Grand Godfather.
Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you."
Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.
Ned Jones,Don't worry.
Ned Jones,I can't.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ned Jones,Just joking.
Ned Jones,I can get up.
Ned Jones,But it's difficult.
Ned Jones,"But I can do it, but it is hard."
Ned Jones,"Look, I don't have a lot of time."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Is it cancer?
Ned Jones,"No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ned Jones,Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport?
Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying."""
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Upsidedown situps.
Chris Traeger,"Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective."
Ron Swanson,Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?
Chris Traeger,"The world's my gymnasium, Ron."
Chris Traeger,But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.
Chris Traeger,Could you hold me while I dismount?
Chris Traeger,Thanks so much.
Ron Swanson,You bet.
Chris Traeger,Question for you.
Chris Traeger,"In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees."
Chris Traeger,You have only seven.
Chris Traeger,Why is that?
Ron Swanson,I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.
Chris Traeger,The department is so small because Leslie Knope singlehandedly does the work of four people.
Chris Traeger,And she's already scaled back her time.
Chris Traeger,"If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council."
Chris Traeger,I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,"Chris, that's unnecessary."
Ron Swanson,The department is doing fine without Leslie.
Chris Traeger,Then prove it.
Chris Traeger,Complete one major project.
Ron Swanson,"Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core."
Ron Swanson,Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.
Ron Swanson,"I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them."
Ron Swanson,And they were delicious.
Ben Wyatt,"Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town."
Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game."
Ned Jones,Damn straight.
Ned Jones,This is very impressive.
Ned Jones,"You know, you remind me of my brother."
Ned Jones,"You have the same name, Leslie."
Ned Jones,He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.
Ned Jones,The middle third.
Ned Jones,But they sutured the hell out of him.
Ned Jones,He's he's fine now.
Ned Jones,"Much shorter, but a goodlooking, young, flat man."
Ned Jones,"What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?"
Ned Jones,She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.
Ned Jones,I told her sorry.
Ned Jones,I don't talk politics after dinner.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, she worked with James Carville?"
Ben Wyatt,She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture."
Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?
Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?
Ben Wyatt,Newport's scared.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her."
Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to set up a meeting.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you."
Ben Wyatt,And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.
Ben Wyatt,Home field advantage.
Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.
Ron Swanson,Nonsense.
Ron Swanson,We are close friends.
Ron Swanson,I have good news for you.
Ron Swanson,I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, great."
Ann Perkins,"For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts."
Ann Perkins,"It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk."
Ann Perkins,"Kiss one water fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,Including him.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Set up shop in our office.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, take Leslie's desk."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I will."
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Great.
April Ludgate,Do you want the door open or shut?
Ann Perkins,"Ah, open's fine."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta."
Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone."
Extra,You mean Ms.
Extra,Barkley.
Extra,She's already here.
Extra,Last booth.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm Jen Barkley.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,Grab a seat.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry about all these papers.
Jennifer Barkley,I had them shipped in.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm a news junkie.
Ben Wyatt,Is this in Arabic?
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, I've been reading up on you two."
Jennifer Barkley,"Ben, it's a great job on this campaign."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Jennifer Barkley,"And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke."
Jennifer Barkley,This is federal government caliber.
Ben Wyatt,"Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?"
Ben Wyatt,This campaign seems beneath you.
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,"So I was, like, ""sorry, Nick."""
Jennifer Barkley,Your son is a moron.
Jennifer Barkley,There's no way.
Jennifer Barkley,""" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money."
Jennifer Barkley,I shouldn't even tell you how much.
Jennifer Barkley,But I will.
Jennifer Barkley,"$250,000.00 "
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,For six weeks of work?
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Jennifer Barkley,"Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington."
Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, mmhmm."
Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, trust me."
Jennifer Barkley,You can do better than Joe.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, man."
Jennifer Barkley,I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.
Jennifer Barkley,Now I kind of hope you win.
Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.
Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.
Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.
Ben Wyatt,Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.
Perd Hapley,Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America."
Jennifer Barkley,"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady."
Jennifer Barkley,So I guess we both agree.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!
Extra,"I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor."
Extra,Wrong.
Extra,"Not in my town, kid."
Extra,City council's a real job for a real adult.
Ben Wyatt,It's playing every hour on every channel.
Leslie Knope,It's official.
Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message."
Ben Wyatt,"We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement, and that's huge."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king."
Ben Wyatt,Do you wish I were taller or what's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,You're perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everyone."
Ann Perkins,So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.
Ann Perkins,Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.
Ann Perkins,Andy is our official waterfountain tester.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's give this sucker a testdrive."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to."
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that's good."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, any ideas?"
Ann Perkins,Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,That could work.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, still good."
Ann Perkins,Tom?
Tom Haverford,Full disclosure.
Tom Haverford,Ann and I are romantically intertwined.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.
Ann Perkins,"Would you just go, dummy?"
Tom Haverford,What's the best kind of water fountain?
Tom Haverford,How about no water fountain?
Tom Haverford,This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.
Tom Haverford,And only $600 a bag.
Ann Perkins,"April, what's your idea?"
April Ludgate,To go in that room and finish this book.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Is it good?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"You're going to stay here, and you're going to help."
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I drink water?
Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.
Leslie Knope,I'm over here.
Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs."
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?
Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.
Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game."
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,Ramps are an idiot's game.
Extra,This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.
Leslie Knope,What plan?
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Jennifer Barkley,Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?
Jennifer Barkley,Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on out here, Ned."
Ned Jones,Ned Jones is here.
Ned Jones,Say hello to Ned Jones.
Ned Jones,Make way for Ned Jones.
Donna Meagle,Why don't we just turn up the pressure?
Donna Meagle,That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
April Ludgate,"Ah, stop!"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins,That'll teach you to pay attention.
April Ludgate,I have an idea.
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking, ""what if we did ""something like this?"
Ann Perkins,""" Oh, my dude, what the hell?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport's plan is called ""Rise Up!"
Jennifer Barkley,Pawnee.
Jennifer Barkley,""" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town."
Jennifer Barkley,Wow.
Jennifer Barkley,"Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work."
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?"
Jennifer Barkley,Give him a hand.
Ned Jones,"As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport."
Chris Traeger,I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.
Chris Traeger,I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project."
Andy Dwyer,Incoming!
Andy Dwyer,Got you!
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, don't!"
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.
Tom Haverford,"Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Tom Haverford,"Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, everybody."
Ron Swanson,Attention!
Chris Traeger,I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.
Andy Dwyer,Kamikaze!
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"""Stumbling for the first time in months, ""the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down ""a ramp to nowhere."
Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country."
Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I wish I was better at this."
Ben Wyatt,Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe we take the fight to her?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea."
Leslie Knope,That sounds good.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just do that."
Ben Wyatt,"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.
April Ludgate,And sorry we goofed around so much.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did."
Ron Swanson,This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.
April Ludgate,"Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?"
Ron Swanson,I think so.
Ron Swanson,"We may be in for a good, old fashioned shakeup."
Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging"
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too."
Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet"
Jennifer Barkley,You want anything?
Jennifer Barkley,Anything?
Jennifer Barkley,It's on me.
Jennifer Barkley,Everything in this town is so cheap.
Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging"
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.
Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
Jennifer Barkley,I sense that you're angry.
Jennifer Barkley,Tell me why.
Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work."
Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts."
Leslie Knope,My idea is better.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, I don't doubt it."
Jennifer Barkley,The fact is I don't care.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just trying to win.
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, it's not personal."
Jennifer Barkley,I like you.
Jennifer Barkley,But my job is to beat you.
Jennifer Barkley,So have a seat.
Jennifer Barkley,I'll get you some of those waffles you love.
Leslie Knope,How do you know that
Jennifer Barkley,It's my job to know.
Leslie Knope,"God, you're good."
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys."
Chris Traeger,What's so imporant?
Ann Perkins,"Well, after yesterday's hands on brainstorming session"
Chris Traeger,Water balloon fight.
Ann Perkins,Fair enough.
Ann Perkins,We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.
Ann Perkins,Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll I'll try it."
Andy Dwyer,I did it.
April Ludgate,"Good job, babe."
Chris Traeger,"Simple, elegant, and costeffective."
Chris Traeger,"If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void."
Donna Meagle,I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Chris Traeger,I'll give it up for that.
Jennifer Barkley,So what's Ben's next move for you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, let me guess."
Jennifer Barkley,"Um, you're going to attack me."
Jennifer Barkley,"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours."
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jennifer Barkley,That's not a terrible idea.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea"
Leslie Knope,Which you did.
Jennifer Barkley,"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd."
Jennifer Barkley,Because you know what people don't care about?
Jennifer Barkley,They don't care about whose idea was first.
Jennifer Barkley,They care about whose idea was best.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't."
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmhmm, okay."
Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ah, what the hell."
Jennifer Barkley,"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself."
Jennifer Barkley,You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors."""
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Jennifer Barkley,You need to beat our idea.
Jennifer Barkley,Come up with something better.
Jennifer Barkley,I don't know.
Jennifer Barkley,Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.
Jennifer Barkley,"All right, that could work."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Extra,Waffles and a cappuccino.
Jennifer Barkley,"Gracias, Marta."
Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, it does now."
Jennifer Barkley,I bought them one.
Leslie Knope,Course you did.
Ben Wyatt,You talked to Barkley without me?
Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, what if it's a trick?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it."
Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,She's better at this than I am.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to talk about your future.
Ann Perkins,Why are we on this bench?
Ann Perkins,This is weird.
Ron Swanson,You did a great job solving that problem today.
Ron Swanson,The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking
Ann Perkins,I didn't solve that problem.
Ann Perkins,April did.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,Why did she tell me you did?
Ann Perkins,"Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something."
Ann Perkins,"If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you're right.
Ann Perkins,Should I go?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you're still here?"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Perd Hapley,Let's begin the show by starting it.
Perd Hapley,"Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas."
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh They did, they stole our idea."
Leslie Knope,We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Perd."
Jennifer Barkley,This is politics as usual.
Jennifer Barkley,"The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper."
Jennifer Barkley,"There she goes again, Perd."
Perd Hapley,I don't know where she went the first time.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors."
Perd Hapley,And our flash poll seems to agree.
Perd Hapley,Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.
Jennifer Barkley,This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's get back on track.
Jennifer Barkley,I just think our opposition is losing sight of what all this is about.
Leslie Knope,"What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about."
Leslie Knope,What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Jennifer Barkley,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it."
Leslie Knope,"It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads."
Leslie Knope,It was in the Pawnee papers.
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,It's certainly not here.
Leslie Knope,"And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do."
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, we were going to keep this a secret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee."
Jennifer Barkley,And that woman that he is with is an anti landmine advocate.
Jennifer Barkley,I didn't realize that you were pro landmine.
Perd Hapley,"I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner."
Jennifer Barkley,Thank you.
Perd Hapley,"Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial."
Leslie Knope,"I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert."
Ben Wyatt,She kicked our asses.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to beat her?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, she's like a hurricane."
Ben Wyatt,She's everywhere.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, guys."
Jennifer Barkley,You really stepped up your game.
Jennifer Barkley,That was really fun.
Jennifer Barkley,You almost got me.
Leslie Knope,I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
Jennifer Barkley,"What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no."
Jennifer Barkley,That was mostly made-up.
Jennifer Barkley,Don't challenge me on that.
Jennifer Barkley,That will backfire.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys."
Jennifer Barkley,I already took care of the bill.
Ben Wyatt,"Another round, please?"
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ron Swanson,Nice job on the water fountain.
April Ludgate,It wasn't me.
Ron Swanson,Don't deny it.
Ron Swanson,I know it wasn't the nurse.
Ron Swanson,I'm asking you to step up.
Ron Swanson,"Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack."
April Ludgate,I don't want to do things.
April Ludgate,"I want to not do things, just like you taught me."
Ron Swanson,"And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain."
Ron Swanson,And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.
Ron Swanson,"I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you."
Ron Swanson,Please.
April Ludgate,Okay But only because you begged.
Ron Swanson,Good girl.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Ron Swanson,This is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.
Chris Traeger,Excellent.
Chris Traeger,I have been a fan of April since day one.
Chris Traeger,I told
