Tom Haverford,How are the kids?
Donna Meagle,I don't have kids.

William Barnes,"But your thoroughness, as always, is impressive."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
William Barnes,"Now, we have three months until you announce your campaign."

Leslie Knope,"After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up."
Ann Perkins,Why can't you just keep sneaking around?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal."
Leslie Knope,My campaign will be over before it begins.
Ann Perkins,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,I have a plan.
Leslie Knope,And it's really good.

Chris Traeger,Ben and I are launching a full investigation.
Chris Traeger,And I want to apologize to all the women And Jerry.
Chris Traeger,"If I could go back in time, and cut your eyeballs out, I would."
April Ludgate,"Wow, that is so sweet."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,We are getting a lot of media requests about this.
Ben Wyatt,"So Leslie, can you do Perd Hapley?"
Donna Meagle,Ho!
Donna Meagle,She can do Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,Hioh!
Ben Wyatt,"Seriously, can you do his TV show?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Andrew my mandrew, what are you up to?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm about to do an experiment where I huck this at the wall and see what happens.
Andy Dwyer,But that can wait.
Andy Dwyer,Shoe shine?
Tom Haverford,"Andy, I'm gonna be honest."
Tom Haverford,I came here today to talk to you.
Tom Haverford,"Now look, you're enthusiastic."
Tom Haverford,You're hardworking.
Tom Haverford,You can lift heavy things.
Tom Haverford,I think there might be a place for you over at Entertainment720.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Tom Haverford,It's my company!
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm just now getting really good at shoe shining."
Andy Dwyer,"And I mean, I'm still pretty bad at it."
Tom Haverford,Let me ask you this.
Tom Haverford,Are you living your dreams?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm living mine."
Tom Haverford,"And if you wanna live yours, here's my card."
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to read.
Tom Haverford,"Black print, black background."
Tom Haverford,It's the coolest possible color scheme.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,It's also a strong magnet.
Tom Haverford,So don't put it in your wallet.
Tom Haverford,"It will erase your credit cards, guaranteed."
Andy Dwyer,Destroy my credit cards.
Andy Dwyer,Debt and everything?
Chris Traeger,Mr.
Chris Traeger,"Mayor, I promise you that we will find the owner of that weiner and we will punish him."
Chris Traeger,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know who to come to with this, but that picture, uhthere's something very disturbing about the testicles."
Chris Traeger,I've always felt the same way myself.
Chris Traeger,The testicles are like the ears of the genital system.
Chris Traeger,"They serve a very important function, but they're not that great to look at."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, wow."
Ann Perkins,"No, I was speaking medically."
Ann Perkins,They're enlarged.
Ann Perkins,"I think that maybe that guy is sick with something perhaps, a hernia, or mumps."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,You really know your testes.
Ann Perkins,Thank you?
Perd Hapley,"For a female perspective on this scandal, we turn to a woman, Leslie Knope."
Perd Hapley,I'm about to ask you a question right now and that question is this.
Perd Hapley,The lewd photo just how big a deal is it?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope,If you know what I mean.
Perd Hapley,I don't know what you mean.
Perd Hapley,But it had the cadence of a joke.
Leslie Knope,"When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
Perd Hapley,"There you have it, where ""it"" is the thing Leslie Knope just said about this situation."
Perd Hapley,Perd Hap
Leslie Knope,How was that?
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Elizabeth Barnes,Amazing.
Elizabeth Barnes,That sound bite is gold.
William Barnes,"You're gonna get great feedback on this, and we think we can capitalize."
William Barnes,You're gonna announce your candidacy on Friday.
Leslie Knope,Friday.
Leslie Knope,In three months.
William Barnes,"No, this Friday."
William Barnes,Is that okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we'll do that then now soon."
Leslie Knope,"And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now."
William Barnes,Great.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Ben Wyatt,I know it.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you.
Ben Wyatt,That was my brother.
Ben Wyatt,He just had a baby girl.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's horrible."
Leslie Knope,Or good full disclosure.
Leslie Knope,I didn't listen to what you just said.
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you about something
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, before you say anything, let me just show you what I got at Doug's Donuts."
Ben Wyatt,It's an Lshaped eclair!
Ben Wyatt,"The ""L"" is for Leslie For your name."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Leslie Knope,"Bad, really bad."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,How did the breakup go?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair."
Leslie Knope,And then we made out and spent the night together.
Leslie Knope,"But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you opposite of broke up with him."
Leslie Knope,"He gave me an eclair, Ann!"
Ben Wyatt,"Joe, I've determined that the lewd picture was sent by you because you sent it from your personal email address, stinkmaster69@alumni.sarahlawrencecollege.edu."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Sarah Lawrence?
Joe From Sewage,Yeah.
Joe From Sewage,I wanted a small college experience.
Ben Wyatt,You also bragged about it to many of your coworkers.
Joe From Sewage,There's an old sewage department saying.
Joe From Sewage,"""If you've got a nice drainpipe, there's no reason to hide it."""
Ben Wyatt,I doubt that's a saying.
Ben Wyatt,We are terminating you effective immediately.
Joe From Sewage,Is this because you're jealous?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,It's because you broke the law.
Joe From Sewage,The law of having an amazing package.
Chris Traeger,"Before we have him forcibly removed, you should know this, that one of our female employees, a nurse, examined the photo you sent her"
Joe From Sewage,I bet she did.
Chris Traeger,And you have the mumps.
Chris Traeger,You might wanna get that checked.
Joe From Sewage,Sweet.
Joe From Sewage,Someone's got mumps on his lumps.
Joe From Sewage,Up high.
Joe From Sewage,Anyone?
April Ludgate,Ron isn't here.
April Ludgate,"His exwife Tammy came, and he got scared and ran away."
April Ludgate,"Well, as acting manager of the Parks Department, I declare that everything you are saying is stupid."
April Ludgate,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so Tom offered me a job again."
Andy Dwyer,"As my manager, what do you think I should do?"
April Ludgate,"Well, what do you wanna do?"
Andy Dwyer,I think it'd be kinda cool to work for Tom.
April Ludgate,So take it.
Andy Dwyer,But working at a startup can be kind of risky.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
Andy Dwyer,But Tom told me to follow my dreams.
April Ludgate,So take it.
Andy Dwyer,But this isn't my dream.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,Me neither.
Andy Dwyer,You give such good advice.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I love you."
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Did you maybe tell people that I diagnosed that guy with mumps based on his porn photo?
Chris Traeger,I did!
Chris Traeger,I was so proud of you.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, because now I have everyone in City Hall sending me pictures of their junk, asking me if they have mumps."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Your inbox is literally filled with penises.
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,I am so sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, look."
Ann Perkins,Ed Miller from payroll.
Leslie Knope,"Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating?"
Ann Perkins,We've attacked this from all angles.
Ann Perkins,Either you don't run for office
Leslie Knope,Which is out of the question.
Ann Perkins,Or you break up with him and avoid a potential scandal.
Leslie Knope,Do you need to get that?
Ann Perkins,"No, it's just penises."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want you to break up with him either."
Ann Perkins,There's just no other way.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Just be direct and honest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,It's the entire Sanitation Department for Muncie.
Ann Perkins,Ooh.
Extra,Would you like any wine to start?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you."
Leslie Knope,I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
Ben Wyatt,I'll have the same.
Extra,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I really, really like you."
Ben Wyatt,I like you too.
Ben Wyatt,And I think I know what you're gonna say.
Leslie Knope,I highly doubt that.
Ben Wyatt,I think I do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Ben Wyatt,"And, um I got you something."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Is this jewelry?

Leslie Knope,"Oh, I need to go to Another place."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split."
Leslie Knope,I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,Wait Ron.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Running away from my problems.
Ron Swanson,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Ok, so here's what's going on."
Ron Swanson,I didn't ask.
Leslie Knope,"Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet."
Leslie Knope,"I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't."
Leslie Knope,We're still dating.
Leslie Knope,"But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute."
Leslie Knope,He's so nice.
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna stay here, there are three rules you need to follow."
Ron Swanson,"One, no talk about Tammy one."
Ron Swanson,"Two, no talk about Ben."
Ron Swanson,"Three, no talk."
Leslie Knope,I didn't even ask you last night.
Leslie Knope,What is going on with Tammy one?
Ron Swanson,You just violated rules number one and three.
Ron Swanson,You lose your coffee privileges.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you choose, Knope hunting, fishing, or drinking?"
Leslie Knope,I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Ron Swanson,Fishing it is.
Chris Traeger,"And so effective immediately, all male employees must stop sending explicit photos to Ms. Perkins."
Extra,"If I may, what if based on empirical evidence, I truly believe there's a grave and immediate medical emergency?"
Extra,"Were that the case, could I then show you my dong?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,That would be harassment.
Extra,Fair enough.
Extra,Now completely different scenario.
Extra,Let's say I've been watching a lot of women's golf and I've had some wine
Ann Perkins,How about this?
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna get a male doctor to come in and do some screenings.
Extra,Perfect.
Extra,"Just as a backup, I'm sending you some photos."
Ann Perkins,That will not be necessary.
Extra,That's me.

Tom Haverford,Sodid you get a chance to think about my offer?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna do my dreams, but I just don't think my dream is working for a company that puts logos on stuff."
Tom Haverford,That's not my company does.
Tom Haverford,"Although, maybe we'll start."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, what you think?"
Tom Haverford,Donna that looks great.
Donna Meagle,I could do without this one.

Leslie Knope,I might not win.
Ron Swanson,You'll win.
Leslie Knope,I might not run.
Ron Swanson,You should.
Ron Swanson,"What's our plan here, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores."
Ron Swanson,I don't have the material for s'mores.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Leslie Knope,"Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for two three years."
Ron Swanson,"You know, when I was 12, my brother shot me in the pinky toe with a nail gun."
Ron Swanson,"Granted, it was a hilarious prank, and we all had a good laugh."
Leslie Knope,That's awful.
Ron Swanson,But I avoided going to the doctor.
Ron Swanson,I hate paperwork.
Ron Swanson,"After a few weeks, the toe just kinda fell off."
Leslie Knope,You only have nine toes?
Ron Swanson,I have the toes I have.
Ron Swanson,Let's just leave it at that.
Ron Swanson,"The point is the doctor said if I had come in right away, they might've saved the toe."
Ron Swanson,You can't run away from your problems.
Leslie Knope,Especially if you only have nine toes.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was uncalled for.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,And you're Leslie [bleep] Knope.
Ron Swanson,You with me?
April Ludgate,"Well, what is your dream?"

Andy Dwyer,But that could take another three to five years
Andy Dwyer,Don't get me wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Shoe shining has been a been a pretty wild ride.
Andy Dwyer,But is it possible there's something more out there for me?
April Ludgate,"Andy, there's tons of stuff you can do."
April Ludgate,I'll help you figure it out.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"One year from now, you, Andy Dwyer, will no longer be a shoe shinist."

April Ludgate,You're running for office?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, City Council."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, that is great."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,Will you pledge right now not to raise taxes?
Leslie Knope,I think that's premature.
Donna Meagle,"No pledge, no vote."
Ron Swanson,The point is she needs an assistant.
Ron Swanson,Start asking around
April Ludgate,Hire Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy can do it.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah."

Ron Swanson,"I'll be in my office, waiting for Tammy one."
April Ludgate,You want me to find her?
Ron Swanson,There's no need.
Ron Swanson,She'll find me.
Ron Swanson,She has the tracking ability and body odor of a bloodhound.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, so now you're sure that everything is okay, you know, down there?"
Dr. Harris,You're perfectly healthy.
Dr. Harris,That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.
Dr. Harris,I actually don't even know if he has mumps.
Dr. Harris,Forgot to look.
Dr. Harris,I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope,"I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you."
Leslie Knope,"What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change"
Ben Wyatt,So just open the box.
Leslie Knope,"Please stop bringing out the box, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Leslie Knope,"You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, then I'll just open the box for you."

Leslie Knope,Why? Why do we have to break up?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie, everything you've accomplished, you have earned and you have worked for."

Leslie Knope,But I really like sleeping with my boss.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, it's not you, it's me."

Ben Wyatt,I just don't like you anymore.
Ben Wyatt,"I know it's hard to hear that, but You're boring, and frankly you disgust me."
Ben Wyatt,Echh!
Leslie Knope,How did you figure it out?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, there was a dude in the ladies' yacht club."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but I covered that pretty well."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, you've been making campaign speeches in your sleep."
Ben Wyatt,"Granted, you always do that, but they got really specific and moving."
Leslie Knope,Did I have a good opening line?
Ben Wyatt,"It was simple, but I liked it."
Leslie Knope,"Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council."
