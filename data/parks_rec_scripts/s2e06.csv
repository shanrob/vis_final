Leslie Knope,Go ahead.

Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay-- Um, I wore those once."
Leslie Knope,"It was a moneyback guarantee, but I forgot to return them."
Leslie Knope,"Man Pillow, the pillow shaped like a man?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Also something called ""Bucket of Cake."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I think someone definitely stole my credit card.
Leslie Knope,So why don't you just cancel it?
Extra,Do you wanna hear what else they purchased?

Keef,"My name is Keef, and I am your friend."
Keef,Are you guys my friends?
All,Yeah.
Keef,All right!
Keef,Awesome!
Keef,It is playground time!
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're here in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,It's two towns over.
Leslie Knope,"And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day."
Keef,High five!
Keef,High five!
Keef,High five!
Leslie Knope,I never trust anything that comes that quickly.
Leslie Knope,That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.
Leslie Knope,"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?"
Keef,Nope.
Keef,"One day, 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Keef, that is so incredible."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done."
Keef,Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.
Keef,"You can look at a problem, and you can either go, ""Oh, this is a problem"" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great."
Keef,You literally kaboom the problem.
Keef,"Come on, people!"
Keef,I see more ground than playground!
Keef,Kaboom.
Ron Swanson,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Ann Perkins,"Man, this is tough."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing: fat kids, skinny kids, brainiacs, sluts, the gay drama kids, goths, jocks, the alternative crowd."
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,I'm volunteering.
Andy Dwyer,I love to volunteer.
Andy Dwyer,The key to volunteering?
Andy Dwyer,A lot of pockets.
Andy Dwyer,For putting all the food in.
Andy Dwyer,The Red Cross has amazing cookies.
Andy Dwyer,I go there all the time.
Andy Dwyer,Meals On Wheels was a bonanza.
Andy Dwyer,"Suicide Hotline, surprisingly lame spread."
Andy Dwyer,I thought I'd give back to those less fortunate than myself.
Ann Perkins,You live in a pit.
Andy Dwyer,Not anymore.
Andy Dwyer,Living with the drummer of my band.
Andy Dwyer,"Living indoors, pretty cool, not to brag."
Andy Dwyer,Kind of hard not to.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow, got to go, me and an old Asian lady are double-teaming some monkey bars."
Keef,"Hey, look."
Keef,I got a remote control and I'm controlling you.
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,"Go faster, Ron's the master."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,You have been officially kaboomed.
Keef,Whoa.
Keef,Look at you two and your big kabooms.
Keef,Great job.
Keef,I got gifts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Keef,"There you go, for you."
Keef,And one more for you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Keef,"So, you guys gonna join us tomorrow in Muncie?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I wish, but back to the real world."
Keef,"At least you guys will be kabooming somewhere, right?"
Keef,"Remember, you take a man kabooming, he kabooms for a day."
Keef,But you teach a man how to kaboom.
Keef,"Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so pumped."
Leslie Knope,Feel I could take on the world.
Ann Perkins,"I could prep, like, a thousand diagnostic tests."
Ann Perkins,In an hour.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Ann Perkins,"There it is, the pit."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,There's something I wish I could kaboom.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we are."
Leslie Knope,It's just a slow boom.
Leslie Knope,"A slower, more deliberate kaboom."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Ann Perkins,See you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what this mess is?
Leslie Knope,This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,You know what this is?
Leslie Knope,This is a kaboomer.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?"
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, guys, I I just grabbed the wrong--"
Leslie Knope,This is a big--
Jerry Gergich,I grabbed the wrong--
Leslie Knope,"This is gonna open very big, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.
Leslie Knope,And this is clean.
Leslie Knope,How do we speed up the process?
Leslie Knope,How do we kaboom it?
Leslie Knope,"Rules, codes, permits, red tape."
Leslie Knope,I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.
Leslie Knope,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry."
Leslie Knope,Maybe strip mining.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up."
Leslie Knope,"Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today."
Tom Haverford,I have a couple of doing caps in my wallet.
Tom Haverford,That's what I call condoms.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Focus, please."
Leslie Knope,How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,Ideas?
Tom Haverford,We need to cut through the red tape and get the pit filled in.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody else needs to participate."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This idea better be good.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,I support you.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me."
Leslie Knope,I want to kaboom it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I talk to you outside really quick?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Good job, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,So you really wanna get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,And you'll do whatever it takes?
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug."
Leslie Knope,I want to move like a cheetah.
Leslie Knope,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.
Leslie Knope,"Something more plausible than that, but fast."
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you break the rules?
Leslie Knope,I won't murder.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good to know.
Mark Brendanawicz,But it's actually very simple.
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wow."
Leslie Knope,So who gives me the go ahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?
Leslie Knope,Is it Ron?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's nobody.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's nobody, it's you."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to be bold.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, look."
Mark Brendanawicz,You wanna get the pit filled in?
Mark Brendanawicz,Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me."
Leslie Knope,What should I do?
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back."
Ann Perkins,And that friend is me.
Leslie Knope,You'll help me?
Ann Perkins,"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What are we doing?
Ann Perkins,Is it dangerous?
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna murder anyone.
Leslie Knope,It was crazy.
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a single permit.
Leslie Knope,Nobody stamped anything.
Leslie Knope,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it."
Leslie Knope,I've never rented a guy before.
Leslie Knope,I wish I knew about that during prom.
Ann Perkins,"There was a girl at my prom who was known as ""the back ho."""
Ann Perkins,Mary Dunbar.
Ann Perkins,She'd let anyone massage her back.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited we're doing this.
Leslie Knope,And we're doing it without permission.
Leslie Knope,We're giving ourselves permission.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I had these hard hats made."
Leslie Knope,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,"Kick, Ass."
Ann Perkins,I'll take that one.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Do you feel giddy?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud of us.
Construction Worker,"Miss Montague, you ready?"
Leslie Knope,"I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"First, speech."
Leslie Knope,Is important moment here.
Leslie Knope,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole."
Leslie Knope,Dump it!
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep].
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,I'm okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that beeping was sure annoying."
Andy Dwyer,But this is even more annoying.
Ann Perkins,I'll handle this.
Ann Perkins,"The monitor is not a toy, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Anything is a toy if you play with it.
Ann Perkins,I'll chalk that up to your concussion.
Ann Perkins,The good news is your CAT scan's clear.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I'm really happy you're okay."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie was worried, too."
Ann Perkins,We should've checked before to see if you were home.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I told you."
Andy Dwyer,I moved out of the pit.
Andy Dwyer,I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.
Andy Dwyer,"Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off."
Andy Dwyer,Next thing you know... Dirt.
Ann Perkins,Scooch up for one sec.
Ann Perkins,And back down.
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That is perfect.
Andy Dwyer,It's like I'm lying in a cloud.
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann and Andy, just like old times."
Andy Dwyer,The pit works in mysterious ways.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did."
Leslie Knope,What's my crime?
Leslie Knope,I got bold?
Leslie Knope,And a little negligent?
Ron Swanson,Knope!
Ron Swanson,My office!
Ron Swanson,Now!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Can I smoke in here?
Ron Swanson,You don't smoke.
Leslie Knope,Just asking if I can.
Ron Swanson,Are you high?
Leslie Knope,I'm high on kaboom.
Leslie Knope,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,"You never did ask me for permission, did you?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'm sorry to burst your ka- bubble, but I just had my ass ka- handed to me by the City Manager."
Ron Swanson,And now this entire department is ka- screwed.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry."
Ron Swanson,What the K- [bleep] were you thinking?
Ron Swanson,I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.
Ron Swanson,I like saying no.
Ron Swanson,It lowers their enthusiasm.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Ann Perkins,"So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,My sexy sweater.
Andy Dwyer,It has a hole cut out over the bicep.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,No problem.
Andy Dwyer,"No, A-Cakes, seriously, thank you."
Ann Perkins,You're welcome.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,What... What are you... What do you think is happening right now?
Andy Dwyer,"A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, we're not back together."
Ann Perkins,You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,Is that still happening?
Andy Dwyer,I don't get it.
Andy Dwyer,What does he have that I don't have?
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Everything.
Ann Perkins,"He has, literally, everything you don't have."
Ann Perkins,"A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say ""tampon"" without giggling."
Ann Perkins,Mark has his life together.
Ann Perkins,I'll get you a different nurse.
Leslie Knope,It's awful what happened to Andy.
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs."
Leslie Knope,What's the alternative?
Leslie Knope,No omelets at all?
Leslie Knope,Who wants to live in that kind of world?
Leslie Knope,Maybe birds.
Leslie Knope,Then all their babies would live.
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope?
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope.
Scott Braddock,Hi.
Scott Braddock,"Scott Braddock, City Attorney."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Scott."
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.
Scott Braddock,I never met him.
Scott Braddock,What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.
Scott Braddock,"I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Is that all you lawyers think about?
Leslie Knope,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?"
Scott Braddock,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can relax."
Leslie Knope,"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault"""
Scott Braddock,"No, no, no, no."
Scott Braddock,You can't say any of that.
Scott Braddock,It admits liability.
Scott Braddock,"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize."""
Scott Braddock,It implies guilt.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,I have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,Andy was a victim--
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""victim."""
Leslie Knope,Of an extremely unfortunate situation.
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""unfortunate,"" and you can't say ""situation."""
Leslie Knope,"I can't say the word ""situation""?"
Scott Braddock,No.
Scott Braddock,It implies there was a situation.
Leslie Knope,Can I give him the pig?
Scott Braddock,"Yeah, the pig's fine."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I got this for you.
Leslie Knope,Hope you squeal better.
Andy Dwyer,Aw!
Leslie Knope,This is my friend Scott.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Scott."
Scott Braddock,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so"
Scott Braddock,"Mmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmm."
Leslie Knope,"Filled with emotions, as any person would."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Scott Braddock,No miming.
Leslie Knope,Uh... you were in the pit.
Scott Braddock,We're not conceding that point.
Leslie Knope,You were in a place.
Leslie Knope,We're both here now.
Leslie Knope,The government--
Scott Braddock,"No, no."
Scott Braddock,No.
Scott Braddock,We got to go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Scott Braddock,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Scott Braddock,Wendell Adams.
Wendell Adams,I'm Andrew's attorney.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, no."
Andy Dwyer,It's my only option.
Wendell Adams,"Andy, stop."
Wendell Adams,I've advised my client not to speak with you.
Wendell Adams,He's suing the City of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?"
Wendell Adams,"Andy, no."
Leslie Knope,"Look, can we just talk about this?"
Scott Braddock,"Leslie, no."
Leslie Knope,This is terrible.
Scott Braddock,"Don't say ""terrible."""
Scott Braddock,Don't look back.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Psych.
Andy Dwyer,Leave a message after the beep.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?
Leslie Knope,I think we should talk.
Leslie Knope,Without lawyers present.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall."
Leslie Knope,Or call me back.
Leslie Knope,Just call me back.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?"
Leslie Knope,Is it because of your lawyer?
Leslie Knope,It's because of your lawyer.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.
Leslie Knope,He's with Jesus now.
Leslie Knope,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Free guitars at City Hall!
Leslie Knope,Everybody run!
Leslie Knope,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,How long have you been there?
Leslie Knope,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, the man lived in a pit."
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground."
Ann Perkins,You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.
Leslie Knope,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit."
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, is that you?"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,We need to talk somewhere private.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Baby, I'm back."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so--
Ann Perkins,Why are you naked?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, because of what you said."
Andy Dwyer,We're getting back together.
Ann Perkins,"No, we're not."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, we are."
Andy Dwyer,You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.
Ann Perkins,"I said, ""Hey, Andy."""
Ann Perkins,"""It's Ann."""
Ann Perkins,""" Can we talk at my house?"""
Andy Dwyer,That's not how you said it.
Andy Dwyer,"You were like, ""Hey, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""It's Ann."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Can you talk at my house?"""
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you are such a baby."
Ann Perkins,Ugh! Literally.
Ann Perkins,"Big, naked baby."
Ann Perkins,Put clothes on.
Ann Perkins,You know what? I should have seen this coming.
Leslie Knope,Has he showed up naked before?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays."
Ann Perkins,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,Where are you--
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann. Just--"
Andy Dwyer,None of your clothes fit me.
Andy Dwyer,So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Is she gone?
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said this was your only option?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.
Andy Dwyer,"I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't sound like Ann.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account."
Andy Dwyer,I put two and two together.
Andy Dwyer,"100,000 dollars, I could probably get a bank account."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either."
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,I'll get a job.
Andy Dwyer,Ann will respect that.
Andy Dwyer,I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.
Andy Dwyer,I can't make six bucks a day.
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,"I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut."
Scott Braddock,"Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's really terrific."
Andy Dwyer,I have my conditions.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Never.
Leslie Knope,I will not negotiate with greedy street people.
Scott Braddock,"Wait, Leslie."
Scott Braddock,Let's hear him out.
Leslie Knope,We planned this.
Andy Dwyer,Kaboom.
Scott Braddock,All right.
Scott Braddock,What's it gonna take?
Andy Dwyer,"One, I want that pit filled in, sir."
Scott Braddock,Is there a two?
Andy Dwyer,"A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker."
Scott Braddock,"Well, we can't accomplish that."
Leslie Knope,"I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit."
Leslie Knope,"What do you say, Scott?"
Scott Braddock,Yeah.
Scott Braddock,"I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit."
Andy Dwyer,"""Eventually""?"
Andy Dwyer,I've already been injured in that thing twice.
Andy Dwyer,"And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually."""
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott."
Scott Braddock,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,This is really happening.
Ann Perkins,I just can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me."""
Ann Perkins,Is that Andy?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess."
Ann Perkins,He settled?
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Gave up 100,000 dollars probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house."
Ann Perkins,Why?
Leslie Knope,Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does?
Andy Dwyer,You always hated this pit!
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, pit."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, lot."
Leslie Knope,How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing.
Leslie Knope,Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.
Leslie Knope,I feel flushed.
Leslie Knope,"My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake."
Leslie Knope,Just waves of pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you did it."
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Ann Perkins,There's so much more to do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're so close."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year."
Ann Perkins,Great.
Extra,Information.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity."
Leslie Knope,I hope they can work us in.
Extra,"Sorry, there's no listing for that name."
Leslie Knope,What? Are you sure?
Keef,Kaboom is a word I made up.
Keef,It's not in any dictionary.
Keef,I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods.
Keef,It's an elaborate prank.
Keef,"For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China."
Keef,They'll never see it coming.
