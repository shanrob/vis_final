Leslie Knope,"I mean, there were rumors that they were gonna announce it next month."
Leslie Knope,But they must've gotten impatient.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Whatever they say, we need to come up with 10,000 possible responses to 10,000 possible scenarios."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Just to remind you, I don't work for the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,How are those scenarios coming?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, before we go in there, you need to know something."
Ben Wyatt,He's here.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Ben Wyatt,The guy whose name you forbid me from saying out loud because it fills you with rage.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't know who he's working for, but I guess he's part of one of the bidding groups."
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna be able to be civil in there?
Leslie Knope,I'm perfectly civil.
Leslie Knope,He's the stupid garbage head doodoo face.
Ben Wyatt,Perfect.
Trevor Nelson,Thank you all for coming.
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Trevor Nelson, legal counsel to the Newport family."
Trevor Nelson,"The Newport Family Trust intends to sell a 25 square mile parcel of pristine, undeveloped land containing Lake Eagleton and the Southern Indiana Foothills."
Ben Wyatt,Why now?
Ben Wyatt,The Newports have owned this land for 100 years.
Trevor Nelson,"Thanks to the recent economic boom in Pawnee, real estate prices are at an all time high."
Trevor Nelson,"And in the words of Jessica Wicks Newport, heir to the entire Newport fortune, quote, ""It's time to trade those dumb old trees for a buttload of cash."""
Jessica Wicks,It is.
Jessica Wicks,It truly is.
Leslie Knope,"This land is begging to be a new national park, and it's in my own backyard!"
Leslie Knope,This could be my crowning achievement.
Leslie Knope,I could retire.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna work until I'm 100 and then cut back to four days a week.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm already so bored thinking about that one day off.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll go to law school or something.
Trevor Nelson,"We will select the finalists from a set of initial, sealed bids due at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow."
Trevor Nelson,Good luck.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,There he is.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,He's here?
Ben Wyatt,He is coming over.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to talk to him.
Leslie Knope,I should hide.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He should hide.
Leslie Knope,He should run.
Leslie Knope,He should run away.
Leslie Knope,He should hide his stupid face.
Leslie Knope,He shouldn't be--
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Miss Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former strange person I used to friend."
Leslie Knope,You're looking very Ron like.
Ron Swanson,You have your same hair.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,I have bangs now!
Ron Swanson,"I've never known what bangs are, and I don't intend to learn!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe you should!"
Ron Swanson,I left the Parks Department two years ago.
Ron Swanson,"Now I work in the private sector, running my own building and development company."
Ron Swanson,It's called Very Good Building and Development Company.
Ron Swanson,I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.
Ben Wyatt,So your company is involved with one of the bidders?
Mike Bean,"Hell yeah, pimp!"
Mike Bean,He's on Team Gryzzl now.
Mike Bean,We hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.
Mike Bean,Right here in town on that land.
Mike Bean,"Oh, my gosh."
Mike Bean,It's perfect.
Mike Bean,The trees and rocks and the sky.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,The land has good sky.
Mike Bean,"This guy, he's so far out."
Mike Bean,So normcore.
Leslie Knope,You know that the National Park System deserves this land.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to screw me?
Leslie Knope,This is like Morningstar all over again!
Ron Swanson,This is nothing like Morningstar.
Ron Swanson,And that was two years ago.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you don't know who you're dealing with."
Leslie Knope,"I directly oversee 1,200 people."
Leslie Knope,I have a staff of creative geniuses that will not stop working until we win this bid!
Ed,Leslie!
Ed,"I couldn't find that file you wanted, but I did find a file called Bird Census 1980."
Ed,And it's empty.
Leslie Knope,"Get out of here, Ed!"
Leslie Knope,I fired you.
Ed,Right.
Ed,"If anybody wants to hang, I will be at Subway."
Leslie Knope,He's very stupid.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I just dropped off Leslie's triplets with her mom."
Andy Dwyer,All three of 'em.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Look what she gave us.
Andy Dwyer,Slow cooker!
April Ludgate,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,So hurry up and get ready.
April Ludgate,The gala starts in an hour.
April Ludgate,"And don't forget, tomorrow we have to go to that guy's office to sign the renters insurance forms."
April Ludgate,Get ready.
April Ludgate,Go.
Andy Dwyer,Everything is going great.
Andy Dwyer,April's kicking ass at her National Parks job.
Andy Dwyer,"I work there part time, and I have my own TV show."
Perd Hapley,Welcome back to the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show.
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny."
Jerry Gergich,I have something for ya.
Andy Dwyer,It's Mailman Barry.
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, Barry."
Andy Dwyer,I have something for you.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, no."
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas attack!
Jerry Gergich,Andy.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That's my crotch.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Three more kicks apiece.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, hi!"
Leslie Knope,I'm glad I caught you before you left.
Leslie Knope,"Just between you and me, what do you think your land might sell for tomorrow?"
Jessica Wicks,Trevor says it'll probably be around $90 million.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Jessica Wicks,I know!
Jessica Wicks,I am just-- I am so happy for me!
Leslie Knope,Would you ever consider giving the federal government a discount?
Leslie Knope,For a very good cause?
Leslie Knope,A National Park?
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, Leslie, I have always liked you."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no, you haven't though."
Jessica Wicks,But I also like money.
Jessica Wicks,And money pays for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,Leslie doesn't pay for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,Money does.
Jessica Wicks,"So, between money and Leslie... You see the bind that I'm in?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a tough one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.
Leslie Knope,And that's oddly comforting.
Jessica Wicks,"Thank you, sweetie!"
Tom Haverford,Who is Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,"He's a mentor, a lover, a hero."
Tom Haverford,But who is my hero?
Tom Haverford,Simple.
Tom Haverford,It's me five years from now.
Extra,"Okay, I really only need a correct spelling of your last name."
Tom Haverford,You are looking at one of Indiana Business Monthly's 35 under 35.
Tom Haverford,"I own Pawnee's hottest restaurant, two fast casual eateries, and the Tommy Chopper."
Tom Haverford,We serve chopped salads out of a decommissioned military helicopter.
Tom Haverford,I'm a mogul now!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Ben Wyatt!
Tom Haverford,City Manager of Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,The Chamber of Commerce asked me to introduce him at a very fancy black tie gala tonight.
Tom Haverford,"One of the many area bigwigs who comes to me for life advice, fashion tips... You get it."
Tom Haverford,Write this all down.
Ben Wyatt,"So, for the introduction, I'd love it if you could just keep it brief."
Ben Wyatt,Like stick to my fiscal accomplishments.
Tom Haverford,"Wanna wake me up when you're done boring us to death, am I right, Janet?"
Tom Haverford,Write down that I'm funny.
Tom Haverford,Benji.
Tom Haverford,Relax.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,When's Tommy ever let you down?
Ben Wyatt,Constantly.
Ben Wyatt,I'm being honored at a gala tonight because I'm in charge of the Pawnee Bicentennial Celebration.
Ben Wyatt,"It's my biggest project since Ice Town, so it really means a lot that I'm being recognized as a city leader instead of being yelled at and pelted with things."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,"You don't think this is all an elaborate setup to pelt me with things, do you?"
April Ludgate,"It takes, like, eight hours to cook something in this thing."
April Ludgate,I guess I could pick up a brisket tomorrow and start it for dinner Thursday.
Andy Dwyer,Thursday's no good.
Andy Dwyer,I have production meetings all day.
Andy Dwyer,I think we've got dinner with Joe and Donna on Friday.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know, Sunday, we can go to the farmer's market, put the brisket in the slow cooker, get a movie on Pay Per View."
Andy Dwyer,The new Jason Bourne movie is supposed to be pretty funny.
April Ludgate,"Andy, we're planning our whole week, like old people!"
April Ludgate,We used to be spontaneous and weird.
April Ludgate,We used to eat cereal out of Frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.
April Ludgate,You once broke a rib trying to wrestle one of those inflatable floppy guys at a car dealership.
Andy Dwyer,I won.
April Ludgate,Now you sprained your shoulder trying to clean out the stupid gutter.
April Ludgate,You even have a job.
April Ludgate,We have a bank account!
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,"We've held out as long as we could, but it finally happened."
April Ludgate,We're boring.
April Ludgate,We're boring people who bore each other by being boring.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,We are still fun!
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna prove it to you.
Andy Dwyer,"Tonight, at the gala, we are gonna do something spontaneous and weird."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Stop taunting me.
Leslie Knope,Get on the phone to Washington.
Leslie Knope,Call in every favor that we have.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, put Missouri on the back burner, this is top priority."
Leslie Knope,"You all have 36 hours to find me 90 million dollars, go!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,90 million dollars?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I only have 2 million dollars in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions."
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, attendance has been up."
Leslie Knope,That's not a coincidence.
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee's rich and famous will all be here tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you start there.
Leslie Knope,That is a very smart idea.
Leslie Knope,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Wave this pen around.
Ben Wyatt,Focus.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get that park.
Leslie Knope,That park is my dream.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let it slip away.
Leslie Knope,Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron have more money?
Leslie Knope,"I have the most valuable currency in America, a blind, stubborn belief that what I am doing is 100% right."
Leslie Knope,Ken Hotate!
Leslie Knope,Great bolo tie.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, it is."
Ken Hotate,My son sells them on Etsy.
Ken Hotate,He is a huge disappointment.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds."
Ken Hotate,How short?
Leslie Knope,88 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?
Ken Hotate,"You know, we have been considering opening a second resort."
Leslie Knope,"No, it would be a donation."
Leslie Knope,The government would keep the land.
Ken Hotate,So you would like the Wamapoke people to pay the federal government millions of dollars to buy land that was stolen from us by the federal government?
Ken Hotate,And we don't even get to keep the land?
Leslie Knope,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony."
Leslie Knope,"So, are you in?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm so crazy and spontaneous, I don't even need this sling anymore."
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that pop?
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do shots?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'd love to do a shot."
April Ludgate,'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.
Andy Dwyer,This is gonna be fun.
Andy Dwyer,What do you wanna do first?
April Ludgate,I dare you to eat this entire jug of olives.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take a Zantac.
Andy Dwyer,All that salt will give me heartburn.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,You ruined it.
April Ludgate,We have to figure something else out.
Andy Dwyer,Should I still take the Zantac?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you always feel better when you do."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"I hate us, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission."
Leslie Knope,"So, hands in, ""Defeat Ron"" on three!"
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, actually, Ron promised me I could build a restaurant on the new Gryzzl campus."
Tom Haverford,So I'm kind of totally on Ron's side.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom's dead to me."
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,I'm waiting for your hand.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Ron hired Regal Meagle Realty to broker the deal.
Donna Meagle,And I'm gonna need the money for my wedding.
Donna Meagle,Shia LaBeouf designed wedding dresses do not come cheap.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're getting married?
Leslie Knope,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,And you didn't tell me earlier.
Leslie Knope,How could you?
Donna Meagle,Joe popped the question a few days ago.
Donna Meagle,I didn't post anything on Gryzzl Feed 'cause I wanted to tell you in person.
Leslie Knope,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you."
Donna Meagle,How are you?
Donna Meagle,How are the kids?
Leslie Knope,They're great.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they're trying to destroy us."
Leslie Knope,"There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great."
Tom Haverford,"We gotta run, Les."
Tom Haverford,Sorry for totally crushing it and you in the process.
Tom Haverford,Later.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, never fear, because Terry is here."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I go by Terry now."
Jerry Gergich,Because there was a guy at National Parks.
Jerry Gergich,"He was already named Larry, so they suggested I go by Terry."
Jerry Gergich,"And then I said my real name is Gary, and they said, ""Who cares?"""
Jerry Gergich,"So, it's just a fun group."
Tom Haverford,Good evening and welcome to the Pawnee Bicentennial Gala.
Tom Haverford,"Not long ago, this town was barely on the map."
Tom Haverford,Unless you're talking about a map of the cities with the most obese pets.
Tom Haverford,But then one great man came along and he lifted all of us up.
Tom Haverford,And that man was me.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, owner and proprietor of the effortlessly chic, celebrity packed Italian restaurant, Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,And several other establishments.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how could you?"
Ron Swanson,I simply took a skewer for one shrimp and added many shrimp to it.
Ron Swanson,They're long enough for five or six.
Leslie Knope,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?"
Ron Swanson,I didn't steal them.
Ron Swanson,"They're independent people who have moved on to better things, just like you did."
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp?
Ron Swanson,I fit seven on this one.
Ron Swanson,It's a masterpiece.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?"
Tom Haverford,"People come up to me, and they say things like, ""Tom, given all that you've accomplished, is it hard to stay humble?"""
Tom Haverford,"And I say, ""Not for me."""
Tom Haverford,"""I'm pretty amazing at being humble."""
Tom Haverford,But enough about me.
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pawnee's Man of the Year 2017, Mr. Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to Tom for that moving tribute to you.
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to the Boys and Girls Club for the incredibly lifelike papier-mache statue.
Ben Wyatt,"You know when I first moved here, Iâ¦"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh I guess it's time for cake?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Perfect timing.
Andy Dwyer,How about this?
Andy Dwyer,"We shut off the lights, turn 'em back on."
Andy Dwyer,Everybody's fancy jewelry is missing.
Andy Dwyer,"Meanwhile, you and I are already on a boat to the airport."
April Ludgate,Let's put stink bombs in all the vents.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I forgot.
April Ludgate,I got rid of all the stink bombs before I babysat Leslie's kids.
April Ludgate,Being responsible adults sucks butts.
Andy Dwyer,Butts.
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,I'll streak across the stage.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I love it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get naked.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get up there.
Andy Dwyer,Everyone is gonna see my wiener.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you've seen it."
Andy Dwyer,You know how dumb it looks.
April Ludgate,Uh-huh.
Andy Dwyer,Perfect plan.
Leslie Knope,Why are you even here?
Leslie Knope,What have you ever done for this city?
Ron Swanson,My company has stimulated Pawnee's economy.
Ron Swanson,You're just still upset about Morningstar.
Leslie Knope,I told you to never say that word to me!
Leslie Knope,No one should ever say that word out loud.
Leslie Knope,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron."""
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,You don't deserve that candle!
Leslie Knope,Give me that candle!
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Leslie Knope,This candle's mine!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gimme this candle.
Leslie Knope,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!"
Ron Swanson,I stole nothing!
Ben Wyatt,Guys!
Leslie Knope,I want it!
Ron Swanson,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just wheel out the backup cake.
Ben Wyatt,There's no backup cake.
Leslie Knope,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, that seals it."
April Ludgate,Even Leslie is crazier than we are.
Andy Dwyer,"They're still gonna serve that cake, right?"
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""Uh, you might wanna check with the penguin."""
Trevor Nelson,I get it.
Jessica Wicks,You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.
Jessica Wicks,And you have so much money.
Mike Bean,"Thanks, Jessie!"
Mike Bean,"And, hey, enjoy that new prototype Gryzzl Tablet."
Jessica Wicks,I will.
Jessica Wicks,I just love it!
Extra,"Thank you, Jessica."
Extra,"I love you, too."
Extra,I love your skin.
Extra,Give me your skin.
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Mike Bean,There are still a couple bugs with the Al software.
Mike Bean,But maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Let's hit it.
Tom Haverford,About to get some peddies!
Donna Meagle,Peddies on peddies on peddies.
Jessica Wicks,Okay.
Jessica Wicks,You're next.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am sorry that I attended a public event."
Mike Bean,"Yo, Ron."
Mike Bean,"Come on, bud."
Mike Bean,"We're gonna go play some video games, and we want you to watch quietly."
April Ludgate,"After we drop off the renters insurance forms, we need to stop by the grocery store."
April Ludgate,And then we need to sign a suicide pact because our lives are meaningless.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we are not boring people."
Andy Dwyer,"Would boring people get renters insurance, even though it's not legally required?"
Andy Dwyer,Where are we? I have never once been to this part of Pawnee.
April Ludgate,It's the creepy warehouse district.
April Ludgate,It's mostly just raccoons and old car batteries.
April Ludgate,Whoa! Hang on.
April Ludgate,Pull over.
April Ludgate,Look at that.
April Ludgate,This place is amazing.
April Ludgate,Let's go in!
Tom Haverford,"What up, playa? I just wanted to apologize for my intro running long."
Tom Haverford,"But, you know, when it comes to inspirational Will Smith quotes, how you gonna stop at 10?"
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when the Chamber of Commerce asked you to introduce me, I was a little worried you would spend the entire time talking about yourself, which is exactly what you did."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Truth is they didn't ask me to introduce you.
Tom Haverford,I asked them if I could do it.
Tom Haverford,"I was gonna talk about how I owe you so much, and how you stood by me through all of my failures, and I stood by you through all of your terrible outfits."
Tom Haverford,"But when I got up there, I got pretty emotional."
Tom Haverford,"To make it up to you, I'd like to read you the speech now."
Tom Haverford,"""I've known a lot of ballers in my day."""
Tom Haverford,"""But no man balls harder than the man I'm about to bring up."""
Tom Haverford,"""He's kind."""
Tom Haverford,"""He's intelligent."""
Tom Haverford,"""He's a person I'm deeply proud to call my friend."""
Ben Wyatt,It was a pretty good speech.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it was a little sappy maybe."
Ben Wyatt,But I think I liked it.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, Mr. Nelson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today."
Leslie Knope,But this is the only one that matters.
Jessica Wicks,Is this a circle? Or is it an O?
Jessica Wicks,Is Oprah involved in your bid?
Leslie Knope,It's a zero.
Leslie Knope,I bid zero dollars.
Trevor Nelson,"I have to say, that's one of the lower ones we've seen."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one."
Leslie Knope,"Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration."
Leslie Knope,The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.
Leslie Knope,"And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, boo-hoo! It all ran off into the lake."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare."
Jessica Wicks,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,My question is this.
Leslie Knope,What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future?
Leslie Knope,"If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come."
Jessica Wicks,How much was her bid again?
Trevor Nelson,It was zero dollars.
Jessica Wicks,Oh! That's the part I don't like.
Trevor Nelson,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Just keep me in the running.
Leslie Knope,Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.
Andy Dwyer,"It says here there are 12 closets, three bomb shelters, five dumbwaiters, two and three-eighths baths, no kitchens."
Andy Dwyer,It's a fairly standard layout.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Is that a staircase to nowhere?
Extra,"Yes, it is."
Extra,Good eye.
Andy Dwyer,What was this place?
Extra,Remember the Pawnee Doll Head Factory?
April Ludgate,This was a doll head factory?
Extra,No.
Extra,This was a holding cell for people who went insane on the assembly line.
Andy Dwyer,What's behind this door?
Andy Dwyer,Fire pole!
April Ludgate,So this place has had zero offers?
Extra,"People seem to be scared off, on account of it being haunted and disgusting."
Extra,"After 47 years living here, I decided to move to Orlando to be closer to Disney World."
Andy Dwyer,We are responsible adults.
Andy Dwyer,You know what that means?
April Ludgate,I know.
Andy Dwyer,We have money.
Andy Dwyer,And we are going to buy the [bleep] out of this house!
April Ludgate,Seriously?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Who needs rental insurance? We're gonna live here.
Extra,We now go live to the press conference.
Trevor Nelson,Good evening.
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Attorney Trevor Nelsson with the law firm Fwar, Dips, Winshares, Gritt, Babip, Pecota, Vorp and Eckstein, legal counsel to the Newport family, here to announce that the Newport Family Trust has narrowed this search to two final candidates, the Gryzzl corporation and the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the game.
Leslie Knope,All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking 90 million dollars.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you did convince three unsuspecting toddlers that peas turn into cupcakes in their tummies."
Leslie Knope,I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.
Leslie Knope,"And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever."
Leslie Knope,"In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is where it ends."""
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I still think Kevin James was a weird choice for the reboot."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I think he nailed it.
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm thinking, in addition, to the Tom's Bistros, we have a hyper exclusive lounge area called Tommy's Lounge."
Leslie Knope,Attention! This is war.
Leslie Knope,You guys are going down.
Leslie Knope,And that's all I wanted to say.
Leslie Knope,"Except Donna, Tom, hey."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job."
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really good to see you both."
Leslie Knope,"And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you."
Leslie Knope,"And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart."
Andy Dwyer,And I ate a lot of 'em on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Because we're at war.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man!"
Andy Dwyer,"Buddy, good to see you."
Andy Dwyer,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,It's pretty good.
Leslie Knope,Hey! Andy! Let's go.
Leslie Knope,War!
