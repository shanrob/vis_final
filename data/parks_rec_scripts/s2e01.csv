Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's the situation."
Leslie Knope,Your parents went away on a week's vacation.
Leslie Knope,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.
Leslie Knope,Would they mind?
Leslie Knope,"Well, of course not."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girly girl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking"
Leslie Knope,"Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!"
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!
Donna Meagle,All right!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Just a little something I know.
Leslie Knope,"So, what's up?"
Ron Swanson,Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park.
Ron Swanson,They need you to get down there right away.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.
All,For he's a jolly good fellow
Leslie Knope,Parrots live a very long time.
Leslie Knope,So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.
All,which nobody can deny
Leslie Knope,"Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college."
Leslie Knope,"And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats."
Leslie Knope,But they just flung their feces.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African blackfooted penguins, Tux and Flipper."
Leslie Knope,"And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life."
Leslie Knope,"Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,"By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, at least they're married."
Extra,Are they making babies?
Zookeeper,"Well, not those two."
Zookeeper,Those are both boy penguins.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Zookeeper,Tux and Flipper are both boys.
Zookeeper,"So you should have pronounced them husband and husband, technically."
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, you can cut it out, now."
Leslie Knope,"Just to be clear, that was a friend punch."
Leslie Knope,There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I do understand."
Mark Brendanawicz,You've made it abundantly clear that there's no romantic element to our relationship in any way.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I really hit rock bottom that night.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I mean that I literally fell to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I remember laying there thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why I'm down here and single."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then I started thinking, ""I need morphine."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, I hear you made two male penguins very happy today."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're making history, Knope."
Mark Brendanawicz,I like that.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sticking your neck out, you know."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't stick my neck out."
Leslie Knope,It was an accident.
Mark Brendanawicz,Out of the mainstream.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think that's cool.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the mainstream.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Not out of it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Social activism.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Uh-uh.
Leslie Knope,People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Leslie, some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has a gay bar?
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,The Bulge.
Ron Swanson,It's behind my house.
Leslie Knope,The Bulge is a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, the nights I've wasted there."
Tom Haverford,"""Leslie!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, girrrrrrrrl!"""
Tom Haverford,With eight R's.
Tom Haverford,"""Thank you for supporting the cause of gay marriage."""
Tom Haverford,"""You rock!"""
Tom Haverford,"""The boys at The Bulge."""
Leslie Knope,They thought that was a political gesture?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nobody eat that cake."
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,Step into my office.
Tom Haverford,That's also my office.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, whatever."
Leslie Knope,I know that you are not gay.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,But you're effeminate.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine."
Tom Haverford,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Effeminate.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?"
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"They sent you Tshirts, too."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt."
Leslie Knope,Hmmâ¦
Tom Haverford,Mine has a collar on it.
April Ludgate,There she is.
April Ludgate,Leslie!
April Ludgate,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben."
Ben,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?"
April Ludgate,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
April Ludgate,"Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek."
April Ludgate,And I hate Ben.
Derek,It's not that complicated.
Ben,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it."
Leslie Knope,So what can I do for you guys?
April Ludgate,"They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins."
April Ludgate,No!
Leslie Knope,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance."
Ben,"But you did, and it was awesome."
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community."
April Ludgate,"It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you."
April Ludgate,We really want you to be the guest of honor.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Derek,It'd be amazing if you came.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you have to come."
Leslie Knope,Who made this?
April Ludgate,We did.
Derek,"Yeah, we did."
Leslie Knope,How?
April Ludgate,Photoshop.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ben,Computers.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, why are you all dolled up?"
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.
Leslie Knope,I guess gay men are starting to like me.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.
Donna Meagle,"Well, you look good, girl."
Donna Meagle,You're gonna turn somebody tonight.
Leslie Knope,That was hands down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,I love your top.
Marcia Langman,"Oh, thank you so much."
Marcia Langman,I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so."
Leslie Knope,"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?"
Marcia Langman,"Well, you could resign, if you're up for it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're serious?"
Marcia Langman,"When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"That was not my intention, at all."
Marcia Langman,"Well, why else would you marry penguins?"
Leslie Knope,Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.
Leslie Knope,And it was.
Marcia Langman,"Leslie, are you married?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, probably."
Leslie Knope,"I have a plan, but, no, not now."
Leslie Knope,Not dating anyone yet.
Leslie Knope,Focusing on my career.
Marcia Langman,I thought so.
Marcia Langman,"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us."
Marcia Langman,"So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation."
Marcia Langman,You know what?
Marcia Langman,I'm so terrible with directions.
Marcia Langman,"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?"
Leslie Knope,"It's a left, yeah."
Marcia Langman,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Marcia Langman,Annul the wedding!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi!
Ann Perkins,"I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so."
Mark Brendanawicz,Ouch!
Ann Perkins,Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.
Ann Perkins,He was here for a week.
Ann Perkins,"I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now."
Ann Perkins,"And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains."
Ann Perkins,"So, I don't really know where he is."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?"
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Ann Perkins,But I heard it's really good.
Ann Perkins,I want to see it.
Mark Brendanawicz,We should go together.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, no."
Ann Perkins,I don't think so.
Ann Perkins,That would be like a date.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Say no more.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I hate salad.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me, neither."
Leslie Knope,"Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand."
Leslie Knope,And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English."
Ann Perkins,Mark kind of asked me out.
Ann Perkins,"He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know."
Leslie Knope,I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"No, of course you are."
Ann Perkins,And your friendship is the most important thing to me.
Ann Perkins,And he's off-limits.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe this is a gay bar.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in."
Leslie Knope,Where should I drink now?
Tom Haverford,There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.
Tom Haverford,You can go there.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,Here's the plan.
Leslie Knope,"Our position is, we have no position."
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I can't believe you came."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
April Ludgate,Derek!
April Ludgate,It's Leslie Knope.
Derek,"Leslie Knope, you're my hero!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,That's nice.
Ben,"Leslie, you are looking hot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'm really enjoying this hug.
Leslie Knope,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something."
Bartender,This one is on us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it's freeâ¦"
Derek,Leslie Knope!
April Ludgate,"She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing."
Extra,"We love you, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is green.
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins."
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,You're chanting my name.
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,I just have one thing to say!
Leslie Knope,Together we can change Pawnee forever!
Leslie Knope,Let's dance!
Tom Haverford,"Leslie Knope's in the building, y'all!"
Tom Haverford,Let's get wild!
Tom Haverford,"I've seen so many dudes from City Hall here tonight, it's crazy."
Tom Haverford,"But I guess they've seen me here, too."
Tom Haverford,"So, that's not great."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I got your text.
Ann Perkins,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,They're having a party in my honor!
Leslie Knope,Go to the bar.
Leslie Knope,"If you're my friend, you can drink for free!"
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Cool!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, and maybe next time don't use the words ""medical emergency."""
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here!
Ann Perkins,I'm really sober!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Get a drink!
Leslie Knope,You know why tonight's fun?
Leslie Knope,'Cause everyone's so gay.
Leslie Knope,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!"
Leslie Knope,"Just, it's... Everyone is just who they are."
Leslie Knope,And who they are is just stone cold gay.
Leslie Knope,"Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,I'm having such a nice time tonight.
Leslie Knope,I've met many interesting people.
Leslie Knope,"And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers."
Leslie Knope,"My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face"
Tom Haverford,All morning.
Leslie Knope,Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my
Ron Swanson,Have fun last night?
Leslie Knope,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday."
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.
Leslie Knope,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,I just got a phone call.
Ron Swanson,They want you to go on Pawnee Today.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's huge.
Leslie Knope,What's the topic?
Ron Swanson,You.
Ron Swanson,That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,You gotta go on and defend yourself.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.
Ron Swanson,That's funny.
Ron Swanson,Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.
Leslie Knope,That was me.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.
Tom Haverford,"It's the big time, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.
Joan Callamezzo,Guess who?
Tom Haverford,Uh Megan Fox?
Tom Haverford,One of the Desperate Housewives?
Joan Callamezzo,"No, Joan Callamezzo."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Joanie!"
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous?"
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Tom comes on the show all the time.
Leslie Knope,Joan loves him.
Tom Haverford,You have the softest skin of any woman in Pawnee.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"I wish you could reach, from your TV screen, and just touch Joan's skin for a second."
Joan Callamezzo,That's sweet.
Tom Haverford,You'd have a treat.
Joan Callamezzo,You're pretty soft yourself.
Tom Haverford,How are your kids doing?
Joan Callamezzo,They're pretty good.
Tom Haverford,Is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful?
Tom Haverford,What's it like being the most attractive woman in Pawnee?
Joan Callamezzo,"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'll have to come over for supper."
Joan Callamezzo,Oh! You must.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Ann Perkins.
Andy Dwyer,How you doing?
Ann Perkins,I'm good.
Ann Perkins,How was mountain climbing?
Andy Dwyer,What? Can I come in? I just want to talk to you for a second.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Joan Callamezzo,"We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo."
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?"
Marcia Langman,"The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge."
Joan Callamezzo,"Miss Knope, how do you respond?"
Leslie Knope,I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.
Leslie Knope,"I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo."
Joan Callamezzo,I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.
Joan Callamezzo,"Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?"
Marcia Langman,"Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable."
Joan Callamezzo,Of course not.
Marcia Langman,"We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign."
Leslie Knope,Oh! Is that it?
Marcia Langman,That would do it.
Leslie Knope,Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?
Marcia Langman,"Move to a different town? No, I kid."
Joan Callamezzo,Full of ideas here today.
Leslie Knope,This is the reason why people don't go into politics.
Leslie Knope,"Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win."
Leslie Knope,"I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?"
Joan Callamezzo,"Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Let's go for it.
Leslie Knope,Bring it on.
Joan Callamezzo,I've never seen that on our show before.
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, there Push that, and--"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're on the air!
Joan Callamezzo,You're on the air!
Joan Callamezzo,Good!
Caller,"Yeah, I think that lady should resign."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Caller,You should resign and repay your salary.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, two for resign."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Caller,"I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Caller,And I think you should resign.
Andy Dwyer,You look great.
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,You look fancy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, the monkey suit."
Andy Dwyer,"Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it."
Andy Dwyer,"I sold out! I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind."
Andy Dwyer,"But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot."
Ann Perkins,Good! That's... I'm happy for you.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing"
Ann Perkins,And some maturing.
Andy Dwyer,Yes! Maturing.
Andy Dwyer,"And darn it if I don't just miss you, and"
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you."
Andy Dwyer,"I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, look."
Ann Perkins,"I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Say no more.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, hit me up on my cell phone."
Andy Dwyer,I'll be around.
Andy Dwyer,"And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that."
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Gotta get back to the office.
Andy Dwyer,Have a good one.
Andy Dwyer,Good seeing you.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.
Andy Dwyer,And the rats.
Andy Dwyer,It's like a freaking rat parade every night.
Andy Dwyer,"I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.
Caller,"Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?"
Caller,Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.
Caller,I'll take my answer off the air.
Marcia Langman,I think that's a valuable point.
Leslie Knope,"Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"That penguin wedding was cute, damn it."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna annul it.
Marcia Langman,I'd ask you to reconsider.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia."
Marcia Langman,Is that right?
Leslie Knope,"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize."
Leslie Knope,"I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!"
Joan Callamezzo,Where are you from originally?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no! What did I do?"
Marcia Langman,"So, you will not be annulling the marriage?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I will not be annulling.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Look at them.
Leslie Knope,They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.
Leslie Knope,I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.
Ann Perkins,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,You know what I realized?
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,We're just animals.
Leslie Knope,We don't know anything about love.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I think you should go on that date with Mark.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Leslie--"
Leslie Knope,"Really, seriously."
Leslie Knope,"I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him."
Leslie Knope,"But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it."
Leslie Knope,All that's important to me is that we're still friends.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,Good! Great.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun."
Ann Perkins,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa."
Leslie Knope,"Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy."
Leslie Knope,At least they'll be together.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide."
Leslie Knope,They might die.
Leslie Knope,But it would be so cute!
