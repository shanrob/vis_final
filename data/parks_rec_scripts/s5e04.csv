Tom Haverford,Plain and simple.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to put words in your mouth but case dismissed.

Extra,I'm going to tailor a punishment to fit the crime.
Extra,One week without screens.
Extra,"No phone, tablets, computers, television anything."
Tom Haverford,No!

Tom Haverford,Press send!
Ann Perkins,Howdy.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What's with the getup?
Ann Perkins,I just got back from that dude ranch with Ricky.
Ann Perkins,It was really fun.
Ann Perkins,He bought this for me as a gift.
Leslie Knope,A cowboy hat from your cowboy friend.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow."
Leslie Knope,From your cowboy boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,Your boy cow cow boy.
Ann Perkins,"Just call him ""Ricky."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Great news: Lots of old people have chlamydia.
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Seniors in Pawnee have a lot of time on their hands, and what they're doing with that time is going at it hard, old people style."
Leslie Knope,"A lot of them haven't had proper sex education, and as a result, STDs are having a field day."
Leslie Knope,It's amazing what a few old guys can do with a little bit of charm and a lot of crabs.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sex avengers, these old fogies are very set in their ways."
Leslie Knope,"They're hopped up on E.D. medication and they got nothing to lose, 'cause they're close to death."
Ann Perkins,"Also, seniors can be pretty ornery."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, actually, I think it's pronounced ""horny."""
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Let's pretend that we're old people, and we can ask Ann our grossest, most perverted sex questions."
Leslie Knope,I'll start.
Leslie Knope,"I'm an old lady, why do I need birth control?"
Leslie Knope,I haven't had my monthly since LBJ was president.
Ann Perkins,"Well, with the elderly, we are not so concerned with pregnancy."
Ann Perkins,We're more concerned with disease.
Andy Dwyer,Do pubic hairs get longer the older you get?
Ann Perkins,"I don't think so, no."
Andy Dwyer,Because that's happening to me.
Andy Dwyer,What should I do?
Donna Meagle,Where can I get lube that is healthy to eat?
Andy Dwyer,I ran over my testicles with my jazzy scooter.
Leslie Knope,"I think you're good to go, nursey."
Leslie Knope,I want to jump on that caboose.
Leslie Knope,Choo choo!
Ann Perkins,"You should never eat lube, you need to see a doctor immediately, and I'm sorry, sir, but you have to be under 40 to ride this train."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"That's how you do it, kids."
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"""LeRon James."""
Tom Haverford,We still on for breakfast?
Ron Swanson,You are an hour and a half late for work.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"I can't use my GPS, but I figured it out."
Tom Haverford,I just drove around in circles until I saw something familiar.
Ron Swanson,You live 3 miles from here.
Tom Haverford,"3.4, according to my GPS, which I used to use every day."
Tom Haverford,I can't use screens for a week.
Tom Haverford,Big deal!
Tom Haverford,I'm adapting.
Tom Haverford,I built a real life Pinterest board.
Tom Haverford,I really wish you could click those.
April Ludgate,"Wow, there he is, Barack Obama."
Ben Wyatt,"His name is congressman David Murray, he is our boss and he is white."
Ben Wyatt,Don't embarrass me.
Ben Wyatt,"Congressman Murray, I'm Ben Wyatt, coordinating director of D.C. Operations."
April Ludgate,"And I am April Blart, mall cop."
Congressman Murray,Great!
Congressman Murray,"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Ben."
Congressman Murray,Heard such great things.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I really feel like I know you already."
Ben Wyatt,I've watched all of your speeches and debates.
Ben Wyatt,It's very inspiring.
Congressman Murray,"Thank you, Ben."
Congressman Murray,And thank you all for your hard work.
Congressman Murray,"Now, stay cool."
Congressman Murray,It's a hot one out there today.
April Ludgate,"That's right, you could practically cook an egg on the sidewalk."
Congressman Murray,Terrific.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's make sure we're ready for the strategy session tomorrow."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're still gonna assassinate him, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Don't say that.
April Ludgate,Ben!
April Ludgate,What the hell is he doing?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, can everyone hear me okay?"
Extra,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"I'm councilwoman Leslie Knope, and today we are here to talk about safe sex."
Leslie Knope,"I know this is a personal question, but how many of you out there are sexually active?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Extra,"I have two partners, often at the same time."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone know what we risk when we have unprotected sex?
Extra,Heart attack.
Extra,Falling in love.
Extra,Partner dies on top of you!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the truth is, the greatest risk you face is sexually transmitted diseases."
Andy Dwyer,Are these old people really having sex with each other?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, what'd you think they were doing?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I thought we were just talking about it."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Leslie Knope,And the best way to prevent them is to use protection.
Extra,"Well, that's all fine and good, but what if the banana is soft and mushy, and doglegs sharply to the left?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Jerry, when you check your email, you go to Altavista and type ""Please go to yahoo.com?"""
Jerry Gergich,"Well, how else would I do it?"
Tom Haverford,You don't have your email bookmarked?
Tom Haverford,Do you have any bookmarks?
Jerry Gergich,What's bookmarks?
Tom Haverford,"God, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,You don't deserve the Internet!
Tom Haverford,"I'm going crazy, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,Life without screens is pointless.
Tom Haverford,I made an iPhone out of paper.
Tom Haverford,"It's not the same, though."
Ron Swanson,This is the work of a lunatic.
Ron Swanson,You need to detox.
Ron Swanson,"Tomorrow, we'll go to my cabin in the woods."
Ron Swanson,"It's so far away from civilization, the electric company is not even aware there's a structure there."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"And hey, can you give me a ride after work?"
Tom Haverford,There's no chance I can find my way home.
Donna Meagle,"If you encounter this scenario, simply execute the following maneuver."
Chris Traeger,And stop!
Chris Traeger,"Great job, and very informative, but we need to stop now forever and pretend like this never happened."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happening?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Marcia and Marshall Langman are the town's morality watchdogs.
Leslie Knope,"Marcia is motivated, calculating, and hypervigilant, and her husband, Marshall, is vivacious."
Marshall Langman,"This, that's happening here, is not allowed!"
Marcia Langman,We at the society for family stability foundation object to this smut being taught.
Marcia Langman,It's against Pawnee's abstinence only sex education law.
Ann Perkins,That's only for schools.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, it's not."
Chris Traeger,"The way the bill is drafted prohibits any government employee from teaching anything but abstinence, city wide."
Marshall Langman,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Marcia Langman,"If we allow this filth to be taught to our seniors, the next you thing you know, it'll be in our high schools, then our kindergartens, and before you know it, we have babies in thong underwear."
Marcia Langman,Is that what you want?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's what I want."
Marshall Langman,"Ladies and gentlemen, this vulgar sex show is over."
Marshall Langman,Please forget everything this horrible woman has told you.
Leslie Knope,It is not over.
Leslie Knope,It is far from over.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, pack up our bananas!"
Tom Haverford,This is a great idea.
Tom Haverford,"Fresh air, no screens."
Tom Haverford,I'm getting really good at chopping wood too.
Ron Swanson,You're a regular Paul Bunyan.
Tom Haverford,Ow!
Tom Haverford,I got stung by the wood!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's a splinter."
Tom Haverford,I need to get on webMD now!
Tom Haverford,"I need a iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, something with 4G."
Tom Haverford,There's no time for the edge network.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Wha?
Tom Haverford,Wwwaa!
Ron Swanson,Got it.
Tom Haverford,"I still think we should find a computer and Google ""sterilization techniques."""
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I have a new idea."
Ron Swanson,You need to purge all of this garbage from your system.
Ron Swanson,"Talk about all the things you do on those screens, and let the words just float away into the fresh air, and then we will be done."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, worth a shot."
Tom Haverford,"Every day I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Instagram."
Tom Haverford,"Sometimes I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shorties."
Ron Swanson,See?
Ron Swanson,That was easy.
Tom Haverford,Then I like to go on reddit.
Tom Haverford,"Reddit's great, 'cause it has all the important links you need."
Donna Meagle,New shirt?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I got it at the dude ranch with my boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Donna Meagle,"It's not my favorite shirt, but it is my least favorite shirt."
Marcia Langman,"Perd, we strongly believe in teaching and practicing abstinence."
Marshall Langman,"We all have some crazy urges from time to time, but you just can't act on them."
Marshall Langman,You have to bury them way down deep inside.
Marshall Langman,"You have to say, ""Get out of here, you crazy urges!"
Marshall Langman,"You are not welcome in this brain of mine!"""
Perd Hapley,"There are some statistics that I'd like to share with you now, and they are numbers."
Perd Hapley,Some 85% of Pawnee residents support abstinence only education.
Marshall Langman,And the other 15% are perverts.
Marshall Langman,J.K. you guys.
Perd Hapley,"And 100% of Pawneeans are ""perdverts."""
Perd Hapley,That's the name I call fans of this show based on the fact that my name is Perd.
Perd Hapley,"We'll see you after the break, perdverts."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need an emergency task force meeting."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Ann Perkins,Objective studies have shown that abstinenceonly education doesn't work.
Ann Perkins,People still have sex.
Ann Perkins,"They don't know how to use protection, so the disease keeps spreading."
Ann Perkins,We need to give people practical knowledge.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling, and frankly, almost arousing, but the law is the law."
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're on city council now."
Ann Perkins,Change the law.
Leslie Knope,The people support this.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't fight those numbers even if I wanted to.
Leslie Knope,It's political suicide.
Ann Perkins,So we're just gonna do the thing we know doesn't work?
Ann Perkins,Great plan.
Leslie Knope,"There's no other option, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Put away your sex toys and play with them on your own time.
Andy Dwyer,"I did eat all the bananas, so you can't play with those."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research."
April Ludgate,Shh!
April Ludgate,Look.
Ben Wyatt,What am I looking at?
Ben Wyatt,He's not doing anything.
April Ludgate,That's the point.
April Ludgate,"This morning he got in, sat down in there, and has been staring straight ahead, doing nothing."
April Ludgate,He's a robot.
Ben Wyatt,He's not a robot.
Ben Wyatt,He's just thinking.
Ben Wyatt,He's got a lot on his mind.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like, ""One, one, zero, one."
April Ludgate,"Must eat babies for fuel."""
Ben Wyatt,Why would a robot need to consume organic matter?
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"You know what, they probably put a TV in there, and he's watching old speeches to bone up or something."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go see.
Ben Wyatt,"Congressman, here is the briefing packet for our strategy meeting later."
Congressman Murray,"Excellent, thank you."
Congressman Murray,Anything else I can do for you?
April Ludgate,"No, sir."
April Ludgate,All systems are operational.
Congressman Murray,Great.
Congressman Murray,Stay cool.
Congressman Murray,Hot one out there today.
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, congressman."

Tom Haverford,"Take Ray J, for example."
Tom Haverford,"We all know he's a singer, he's Brandy's brother, and he was in that classic sex tape with Kim Kardashian, but did you also know he's Snoop Dogg's cousin and he was in the '96 Tim Burton movie Mars Attacks?"
Tom Haverford,"Suddenly, you're on the Mars Attacks page."
Tom Haverford,I love GChat.
Tom Haverford,You can talk to anybody.
Tom Haverford,I hit up Brad.
Tom Haverford,Pitt.
Tom Haverford,It wasn't the actor.
Tom Haverford,It's actually a guy named Brad that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.
Tom Haverford,"We don't have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit."
Tom Haverford,"""Emoji"" are little cartoons you text instead of words."
Tom Haverford,"Instead of saying, ""What up, boo?"""
Tom Haverford,"You can type ""What up,"" and then a cute, little ghost, 'cause that means ""boo."""
Tom Haverford,"There's even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist, but the Asian guy also has a racist hat on, and it's like, ""Hold up, didn't Japanese people invent this?"""
Tom Haverford,Podcasts.
Tom Haverford,"There are a million of 'em, and they're all amazing."
Tom Haverford,"JeanRalphio and I have one called ""Nacho average podcast,"" where we rate different kinds of nachos."
Tom Haverford,It seems like
Ron Swanson,"Okay, that's enough!"
Ron Swanson,No more talking.
Tom Haverford,But you told me to get it all out of my system.
Ron Swanson,I had no idea how much you had in your system.
Ron Swanson,"This is a real problem, tom."
Ron Swanson,You are an addict and you need to change.
Tom Haverford,I've downloaded every episode of Intervention.
Tom Haverford,I know what to do here.
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,I am an addict.
Tom Haverford,I've hurt all my friends and family with my addiction.
Tom Haverford,I will accept this gift of rehabilitation.
Ron Swanson,"I'm proud of you, but also a bit fearful that we're verging on what I call ""feelings territory,"" so let's stare at the fire in silence."
Tom Haverford,"I've had a breakthrough, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"What do you say you chop up some more wood, and I'll take your car and go grab us some victory steaks?"
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Marcia Langman,I'm so glad you've come to your senses.
Marshall Langman,Here's our educational pamphlet.
Marshall Langman,I recommend you start reading at chapter three.
Leslie Knope,"""Chapter three."
Leslie Knope,"There's a party in your pants and no one is invited."""
Ann Perkins,This is crazy.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, obviously, the best way to prevent disease is to magically stop all sex, but that's not gonna happen."
Marcia Langman,"Well, maybe not where you come from in ""Trampsylvania."""
Marshall Langman,"Good one, honey!"
Ann Perkins,I'm from Michigan!
Ann Perkins,That wasn't worth saying.
Ann Perkins,Why are you doing this?
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get up there and say a bunch of stuff you don't believe?
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's the law."
Ann Perkins,I get that.
Ann Perkins,I just You're not acting like yourself.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,You want to go there?
Ann Perkins,Go where?
Leslie Knope,You know where we're going.
Ann Perkins,"No, I have no idea, honestly."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I guess we're going there."
Ann Perkins,Are we leaving?
Leslie Knope,You want me to act like myself?
Leslie Knope,You're dressed like a cowboy!
Ann Perkins,So?
Ann Perkins,"It's fun, and I like it."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Andy, you dressed in flannels."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Chris, you dressed in spandex."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please do not lecture me about acting like myself."
Ann Perkins,You're dressed like an abstinence girl on the outside!
Ann Perkins,"God, I'm off my comeback game right now."
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"I don't care, do whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Marshall Langman,"Girl, you look like Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking had a baby and I love it."

Tom Haverford,"Where are we going, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Are we walking to best buy to get a better phone?
Marshall Langman,"I'm Marshall Langman and I'm here to say that sex before marriage is never the way I waited till marriage and then some to do it if you decide to sin, you'll rue it!"
Marshall Langman,Word.
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Marshall."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my aged friends."
Leslie Knope,Some of you might remember that I was here before.
Extra,I don't remember that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was."
Leslie Knope,But I have a new message for you.
Leslie Knope,The best way to be safe is to simply postpone sex until marriage.
Extra,I am not going to be told not to have sex by someone who's ten years my junior.
Ann Perkins,"Amen, Gladys."
Ann Perkins,You're right!
Ann Perkins,"Not about the age thing, about the other thing."
Leslie Knope,"Perhaps you might understand it better if I read to you from this pamphlet, So you think you know more than God."
Leslie Knope,"""Our bodies are God's gift, ""but they're also the devil's playground."

Extra,Can we just see the condom demonstration again?
Extra,'Cause I don't know where Lou has been.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wish I could, but I Oh, screw it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here."
Leslie Knope,"This is a penis, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis."
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, condoms for everybody!"
Leslie Knope,Who wants some?
Leslie Knope,Safe sex for everybody!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Marshall Langman,This is
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who wants to party?"
Leslie Knope,It's a censure from the mayor's office.
Leslie Knope,It's so official.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at the paper quality."
Leslie Knope,This is no joke.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm supposed to help educate the public, but I also have an obligation to uphold the laws."
Leslie Knope,You're my boss.
Leslie Knope,What's my move here?
Chris Traeger,"Actually, Leslie, you're my boss now."
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Why am I still weirdly scared of you?
Chris Traeger,I'm very confident and I make a lot of eye contact.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,"As your city manager, I recommend that you formally apologize and that, in the future, you stick to the letter of the law, but between you and me, as your best friend"
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,I kind of admire what you did up there.
Chris Traeger,Made me happy that I voted for you as my city council member.
Extra,"Okay, this is great, just make sure that you don't go too tight on him, all right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Ben Wyatt,"What's the deal with the congressman? Seriously, like, he seems a little robotic Or something?"
Extra,"Yeah, yeah, he's great, yeah."
Extra,"He turns it on when he has to, and when he doesn't, he just sits there."
Extra,"There's no surprises, it's perfect."
Extra,"Oh, congressman, can you just sit in the chair to test the satellite feed?"
Congressman Murray,Okey-dokey.
Extra,Just run through some of your stump speech.
Congressman Murray,"We've gone through some difficult times, but we're from Ohio."
Congressman Murray,We're tough.
Congressman Murray,"We won't just survive these dark times, we will thrive!"
Extra,That's great.
Extra,Good.
Congressman Murray,Cool beans.
Congressman Murray,See you guys later.
Extra,"God, I love him."
Extra,He's the best.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry I crashed your car.
Tom Haverford,"Please forgive me, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Please, Ron? Please? What are you doing? Are you going to kill me?"
Ron Swanson,"Why do you need to be constantly distracted, tom?"
Tom Haverford,"The truth is I spend a lot of time looking at screens because recently, a lot of the stuff in my real life isn't going that great."
Tom Haverford,So I'd rather play Doodle Jump then think about that.
Tom Haverford,"Okay? I'm sorry, I really am."
Ron Swanson,Go sit in your office while I consider whether to turn you in to the judge.
Ron Swanson,"And while you're there, neither doodle nor jump."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I just wanted to come lend my support.
Ann Perkins,What are you going to say out there?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I got censured, it's a big deal."
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you ask me, you were elected to lead and not to follow."
Ann Perkins,Which is probably what I should've said instead of what I did say.
Leslie Knope,I feel terrible about what I said too.
Ann Perkins,"No, you were right."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I still feel terrible."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, continue."
Ann Perkins,I kind of lost myself in this relationship.
Ann Perkins,"I bought a lasso online, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Ann Perkins,I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.
Ann Perkins,"My personality kinda gets swept up in whatever guy I'm dating, and I want to change that."
Ann Perkins,I broke it off with Ricky.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's good, but I'll tell you, he'll never lasso another heifer as fine as you, Annie Oakley."
Perd Hapley,The story of that commercial break is it's over.
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, what exactly does ""censure"" mean?"
Leslie Knope,It means that I have been formally disciplined for breaking the law.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what they say, ""You break it, you buy it."""
Leslie Knope,That doesn't really apply here.
Leslie Knope,"Tell that to the folks at Pier 1, an establishment I'm no longer allowed inside."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, I'd like to apologize."
Marshall Langman,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Apologize for the antiquated laws in this city.
Leslie Knope,States that teach abstinence only have the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs.
Leslie Knope,To continue this policy is insane.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we all want the same thing, right? We want fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STDs."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we use every weapon that we have? I know that most of you don't agree with me on this, but I'm going to fight very hard to change your minds, and until then, I will take this censure, and I will wear it proudly, like a badge of honor."
Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a woman who is trying to pin a piece of paper to her blazer."
Perd Hapley,"Next up on the program, we hear from you, our fans, in our new segment, ""Are you there, perd-verts? It's me, Perd, hosting a new segment."""
Tom Haverford,I'm so bored.
Ron Swanson,"I have something for you, son."
Tom Haverford,My iPhone?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I am giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree.
Ron Swanson,It is called Auto Repair Manual: 1982.
Ron Swanson,"You will read this book from cover to cover, then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car."
Ron Swanson,"I will not report you to the judge, but if you slip up again, you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe."
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,Two more things.
Ron Swanson,"When you do get your phone back, you will not stare at it when you're talking with another human being."
Ron Swanson,Look a man in the eye when you speak with him.
Ron Swanson,"And second, if you ever need to discuss your problems with someone find Leslie."
Ron Swanson,She lives for that crap.
Ron Swanson,Get to work.
Leslie Knope,They're killing me in the press.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Sun is calling me ""Loose-ly Grope."""
Leslie Knope,But you know what? I don't even care.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kick all their asses! I am so fired up! I'm gonna go right now and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls so I can draft a new bill to undo abstinence only."
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just a machine."
Ben Wyatt,Get stuff done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, why don't you send it to me when you have a draft? I'll try to help."
Leslie Knope,You're the greatest.
Leslie Knope,"But you're gonna have to take out a lot of cursing, 'cause like I said, I am very fired up."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you go get 'em."
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,What are you wearing?
Ben Wyatt,I can't do that right now.
April Ludgate,"Yo, you ready to go?"
Ben Wyatt,"Why, yes, I am, April! Let's go now!"
April Ludgate,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,"Wonderful! Hey, be careful out there."
Ben Wyatt,Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.
April Ludgate,"Oh, no!"
April Ludgate,They got you!
Ben Wyatt,"Terrific! Hey, I'm hungry."
Ben Wyatt,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's go eat some batteries I mean, human food."
April Ludgate,"Hey, uh, batteries I mean, human food sounds good to me."
April Ludgate,Wonderful.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
