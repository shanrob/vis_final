Leslie Knope,"Washington, D.C."
Leslie Knope,"Take a deep breath, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you can practically smell the bills becoming laws."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You can taste the sweet sugar of bureaucracy at work.
Andy Dwyer,That building looks like a boob.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, I know."
Andy Dwyer,It's the White House.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's the Capitol.
Leslie Knope,"My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt, is here working on a congressional campaign."
Leslie Knope,And he took April with him as his intern.
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to visit, but I am also here to work, because I have a very important meeting where I am going to try to get federal funding so we can clean up the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,It's a bit of a fixer upper.
Leslie Knope,"Romantic reunions, government meetings, selfguided museum tours I mean, am I living the dream?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Did I also just walk past a food truck and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Now take out your guidebook.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I didn't bring a guidebook."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I brought you one."
Andy Dwyer,You did?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Now throw it away, 'cause Leslie Knope is your guidebook."
Leslie Knope,I didn't I didn't mean literally.
Leslie Knope,There were some notes in it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, grab the book, and let's hit the National Mall."
Andy Dwyer,There's a mall?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I need to get some flipflops.
Donna Meagle,Why are we having a conference room meeting?
Donna Meagle,Leslie's gone.
Chris Traeger,"Ron has taken initiative, and he is leading the meeting."
Ron Swanson,He's not joking.
Ron Swanson,I wanted to let you all know that I will be throwing the annual Parks Department employee appreciation barbecue.
Donna Meagle,You're going to throw the Leslie Knope Employment Enjoyment Summerslam Grill Jam Funsplosion?
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"You are gonna oversee the Popsicle eating contest, the slip'n slideathon, the watermelon carving, the gazpacho off, and star in a one woman show about parks rules and regulations?"
Jerry Gergich,"""Parks and Dolls."""
Jerry Gergich,"I got your park right here, its name is Ramsett Park."
Ann Perkins,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Tom Haverford,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Donna Meagle,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Jerry Gergich,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Ron Swanson,"I am not doing any of that, which is the point."
Ron Swanson,Every summer Leslie throws a barbecue to thank the Parks and Maintenance staff.
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Ron Swanson,"Barbecues should be about one thing good, shared meat."
Ron Swanson,There will be no froofy desserts.
Ron Swanson,There will be no giant soap bubble guns.
Ron Swanson,There will be no adult men in costumes.
Ron Swanson,"And most of all, there will be no [Bleep] vegetables."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Ron, can we at least have corn on the cob?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"""In this temple, ""As in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."""
Leslie Knope,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever seen any of the National Treasure movies?
Andy Dwyer,Everything in this city is a clue.
Leslie Knope,Nothing in that movie is accurate.
Andy Dwyer,Aha!
Andy Dwyer,A clue!
Andy Dwyer,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,I think that's just gum.
Andy Dwyer,How do I know this isn't a treasure map just waiting to be unfurled?
Leslie Knope,Because it's gum.
Andy Dwyer,That's gum.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So you can see that the color changes about a third of the way up, and it's when construction was actually halted on the monument"
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is a really cool penis, but Ben and April are meeting us at the Smithsonian in 10 minutes."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk on the way.
Leslie Knope,"1776, a nation is born."
Andy Dwyer,Which nation?
Chris Traeger,"I offered Ron a job last month, and he turned me down."
Chris Traeger,And it literally broke my heart.
Chris Traeger,But now I see that this is truly where he belongs.
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, Ron!"
Chris Traeger,"You're really getting it done, man!"
Chris Traeger,He can't hear me.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, let's begin the barbecue."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, little guy."
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,"Everyone, meet your meat."
Jerry Gergich,No!
Donna Meagle,No!
Tom Haverford,No!
Ann Perkins,No!
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing this to us?
Ron Swanson,"Well, in my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life."
Ron Swanson,This is your dinner.
Ron Swanson,His name is Tom.
Donna Meagle,Burn.
Ron Swanson,Seriously?
Ron Swanson,"I understand that it's hilarious, but that is his given, Christian name."
Ron Swanson,Tom is very smart and incredibly loyal.
Ron Swanson,He's basically a dog.
Ron Swanson,"A dog we're going to cook, chew, and swallow."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, there's kids around here."
Ron Swanson,Good point.
Ron Swanson,Which one of you youngsters wants to help me drain the blood from this animal?
Ron Swanson,"If you do a good job, I'll give you the bladder."
Ron Swanson,You can blow it up for a fun play ball.
Extra,"Hey, Ron."
Extra,"You're not going to slaughter that pig here, are you?"
Ron Swanson,Not to worry.
Ron Swanson,I have a permit.
Extra,"This just says, ""I can do what I want."""
Ron Swanson,"I am the director of the Parks Department, and this is a park."
Extra,It's not a Parks thing.
Ron Swanson,"It's against, like, three laws and a dozen health codes."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Barbecue is postponed until I can go pick up some meat from the Food 'n' Stuff.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"No, pig Tom."
Leslie Knope,So I want to see the history of the girl scouts and then Lincoln's pocket watch and the First Ladies exhibit and everything I want to see everything.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, get down from there."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Is this the train from Back to the Future 3?
Andy Dwyer,Get down from there.
Andy Dwyer,I think it is.
Extra,"Hey, buddy."
Extra,"Come on down from there for me, please."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you protect our nation's history, and you're a hero."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, a hero with something to hide, like probably a treasure map."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,It's so good to see you.
Ben Wyatt,It's so great to see you too.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, uh, guys, let's motor."
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get some astronaut ice cream or something.
Andy Dwyer,"We were thinking about maybe just uh, we maybe we were gonna go back to"
April Ludgate,We're gonna have sex.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You look great, April."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, hon."
Ben Wyatt,I actually have to go too.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could sightsee together.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"I have, like, 1,000 meetings."
Ben Wyatt,But I just wanted to come wish you luck before your presentation.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, but you know what you should see while you're here is George Washington's fare"
Leslie Knope,Farewell address candle stand.
Leslie Knope,That was the first thing I was going to see.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Ben Wyatt,"Come to my office as soon as you're done, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And it was nice to see you again.
Ben Wyatt,Are you talking to my butt?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Donna Meagle,Where is Swanson?
Tom Haverford,"Man, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,My legs are tired.
Tom Haverford,It feels like I just exercised.
Jerry Gergich,Just sit on the ground.
Tom Haverford,"No, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"It's dirty, and I'm wearing my summer linens."
Ann Perkins,"God, you're such a baby."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I brought a picnic blanket from your house."
Tom Haverford,That's not a picnic blanket.
Tom Haverford,That's a Merino wool throw for my Eames chair!
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,Do I sense trouble in the Haverford Perkins household?
Tom Haverford,"No such luck, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Ann and Tom, aka Haverkins, are stronger than ever."
Tom Haverford,Everyone said it wouldn't last.
Ann Perkins,And it didn't.
Ann Perkins,Shocking that our drunken plan to move in together wasn't a success.
Tom Haverford,Let's move in together.
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Tom Haverford,"No takebacks when we sober up, though, partner."
Ann Perkins,"No takebacks, partner."
Ann Perkins,"After the first day, we realized we had made a huge mistake."
Tom Haverford,Huge.
Ann Perkins,"However, everyone was being so smug about it, saying there's no way it would last, so we're pretending to still be together."
Ann Perkins,"That way, no one gets the satisfaction of being right, even though they are, but still."
Tom Haverford,"More importantly, I bet Donna 1,000 dollars that we'd be together for another month."
Tom Haverford,I can't stress this enough.
Tom Haverford,"If she finds out that we broke up, I'll go bankrupt."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am returned."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Not so fast, Shirley."
Ron Swanson,"I just have to thaw the meat, season it, and grill it up."
Ron Swanson,So it's going to be a few hours.
Tom Haverford,"No, Ron."
Tom Haverford,My tummy's rumbling.
Tom Haverford,It's scary.
Tom Haverford,Tommy's got the tumrums.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, Chris Traeger feelings update I'm now feeling that your guests are getting a little antsy."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I'll skip a few steps and speed things up.
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Jerry Gergich,Is there at least something to drink?
Ron Swanson,There's beer in the cooler.
Chris Traeger,What about for the children?
Ron Swanson,You can get water from that water fountain and use it to water down the beer.
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just give the kids water?
Ron Swanson,I suppose you could do that.
Ron Swanson,"Now, would everyone please back off and just let me cook in peace?"
Ron Swanson,These people are soft.
Ron Swanson,They're grill virgins.
Ron Swanson,"But by the time this day is over, they'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly shown the ways of flavorful meat love."
Ron Swanson,Mmm The first time is so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are a power couple, like the Roosevelts or the Clintons."
Leslie Knope,I've got a big meeting here.
Leslie Knope,Ben is off running a congressional campaign.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the only way we could be more awesome is if we had our own signature dance move."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,We do.
Leslie Knope,"Three, four."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.
Extra,What's this in reference to?
Leslie Knope,I'm here to present my application for the Federal Riverbed Preservation Grant.
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Most people just mail their applications in.
Leslie Knope,I'm not most people.
Extra,Mr. Jepson actually had to step out for the day.
Extra,You can just add your proposal to that pile there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I was told I would have a facetoface meeting with him so I could make my case for my town.
Leslie Knope,Does he have office hours?
Extra,He's unavailable for the rest of the week.
Extra,But you can just add the proposal.
Extra,He'll get to it.
Leslie Knope,Oh Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a special application.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you know, there's aa CD inside that, uh, plays the sound of a babbling river, and I was going to play that while I gave my presentation."
Leslie Knope,I was also going to show a DVD that had some images of frolicking river otters.
Extra,You know what?
Extra,II'll make sure he reads it.
Extra,What city is it for?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee.
Extra,"Is that Pawnee, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, or Texas?"
Leslie Knope,Indiana.
Extra,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Look at this.
Andy Dwyer,This whole place is your office.
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,This is my office.
April Ludgate,"Ben, you're fired."
April Ludgate,It's my office now.
Andy Dwyer,Boom.
Andy Dwyer,You heard the boss.
Andy Dwyer,"Scram, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,How'd it go?
Leslie Knope,"Um, I think okay."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I have a surprise for you."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, there's a swanky D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Cocktail party at the HayAdams, and I got us all on the list."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at you."
Leslie Knope,You're a big shot.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, uh, Benjamin, how fancy is this party tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, is this, like, a shorts or a pants kind of gala?"
Ben Wyatt,Pants.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Could we just real quick stop at the nearest place that has free pants?
Chris Traeger,"I know that Ron doesn't want us to eat anything before the meat, but I smuggled in some candy."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, thank God."
Tom Haverford,I'm starving.
Tom Haverford,Raisins?
Chris Traeger,It's nature's candy.
Chris Traeger,"Now, they're basically grapes."
Chris Traeger,So remember to pace yourself.
Chris Traeger,I can't even follow my own advice.
Chris Traeger,It's too delicious.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Did you put glitter in the laundry detergent?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I'm experimenting with some new entrepreneurial ideas.
Tom Haverford,"That one's called ""Sparkle Suds."""
Tom Haverford,Dress loud.
Ann Perkins,Will you stop putting glitter in everything?
Ann Perkins,This morning you put glitter in the butter.
Tom Haverford,"""Disco Dairy."""
Tom Haverford,Spread the party.
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a good idea."
Ann Perkins,That's terrible.
Tom Haverford,"Well, the target demographic isn't angry, middle aged nurses."
Ann Perkins,"Oh shh, stop it"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Wait.
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,I'm going to get in line for some food.
Donna Meagle,Y'all want anything?
Ann Perkins,We're good.
Ann Perkins,We're really good.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Just spending a little time with my baby girl.
Donna Meagle,Ew.
Ann Perkins,Get off me.
Andy Dwyer,"There's so much free food at this party, honey."
Andy Dwyer,I love politics.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I made a shrimp claw."
April Ludgate,"I'm really proud of you, babe."
April Ludgate,Now put your used plate in my purse.
April Ludgate,I almost have a complete set.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,You're so smart.
Extra,"They say it will pass, but we'll only get $400 million instead of $900 million."
Ben Wyatt,Kate works at the Pentagon and Lacey works for Eric Cantor.
Extra,"What do you do, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,I was just recently elected.
Leslie Knope,I'm a councilwoman.
Extra,Local government is so important.
Extra,My grandma's on the city council in her town.
Extra,Gives her a reason to leave the house.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Extra,Where did you say you were from?
Leslie Knope,It's called Pawnee.
Extra,"Pawnee, Missouri?"
Extra,"Oh, my that is so random."
Extra,I've been there totally cute.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Missouri, is a total craphole."
Leslie Knope,Ben and I both did some amazing things today.
Leslie Knope,He scored a victory for the congressional campaign he's working on.
Leslie Knope,And I was mistaken for Beverly D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.
Leslie Knope,"So, pretty big day for both of us."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can I have a burger?"
Tom Haverford,I'm hungry.
Ron Swanson,"For the last time, no burgers yet."
Ron Swanson,"I've got ribs, and I've got beef cheek."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, where are my vegan soy patties?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I gave them to the kids."
Ron Swanson,They love them.
Ron Swanson,They're skipping them across the pond.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, I got to go to the boys' room."
Jerry Gergich,Can I have a ride in your car?
Donna Meagle,Absolutely not.
Tom Haverford,This barbecue stinks.
Tom Haverford,I'm saying it.
Tom Haverford,It stinks.
Ann Perkins,Do you have any plates or anything?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, how are we supposed to eat these rumps?"
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, if no one takes me to the bathroom, I'm just going to have to go in the trees."
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,You have ruined a perfectly good barbecue with your demands and chatter.
Ron Swanson,Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody feel like they can't breathe?
Leslie Knope,I think I need some fresh air.
April Ludgate,We're outside.
Leslie Knope,"God, these women they're so smart and accomplished and pretty."
Leslie Knope,And they're tall.
Leslie Knope,Why are they all so tall?
Leslie Knope,It's like CSpan and Neiman Marcus had kids or something.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so there's a couple more people I want you to meet."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I can't wait to meet, like, five more tall women."
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, from Congressman Murray's campaign."
Barbara Boxer,"Ben, I remember you from the Kennedy Center."
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Barbara Boxer,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I wanted to introduce my friend Leslie Knope Senators Barbara Boxer and Olympia Snow.
Olympia Snow,A pleasure to meet you.
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Barbara Boxer,"So, Leslie, what do you do?"
Leslie Knope,"I am a city councilwoman from Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,But you've probably never heard of us.
Leslie Knope,We're small and unimportant.
Olympia Snow,I'm sure that's not true.
Leslie Knope,But it is.
Leslie Knope,We've got tons of problems.
Leslie Knope,We're overrun with raccoons and obese toddlers.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm probably boring you."
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to say that you are my role models, and, uh, you are incredibly amazing women, and it is an honor to meet you, and I really respect your grace under pressure, And thank you for your time."
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie?"
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just tired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I saw 24 historical sights in a day, and it's 120 degrees out with 200% humidity, because this is a stupid swamp town."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that would make anyone cranky."
Leslie Knope,I'm not cranky.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I thought you'd enjoy meeting numbers 4 and 26 on Leslie's list of amazing women.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,You're the most amazing boyfriend ever.
Leslie Knope,"And if you don't get out of here soon, I'm going to punch you in the face."
Extra,Journal needs a quote for the profile.
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just go.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at your apartment later.
Ben Wyatt,This is Ben Wyatt.
John McCain,Excuse me.
John McCain,I just need to get my coat here.
Leslie Knope,"Could you give me a minute here, please?"
John McCain,Are you are you okay?
John McCain,Can I get you anything?
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to just leave and give me a little privacy here, please."
John McCain,All right.
John McCain,I'm sorry.
John McCain,I hope everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,Nosy people have no respect for personal space.
Tom Haverford,Ann what the hell?
Ann Perkins,I put glitter in all your moisturizers and lotions.
Ann Perkins,"I'm calling it ""Sparkle Skin"", by Annie."
Ann Perkins,"Twinkle, twinkle, big star."
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,"That is an amazing idea, and I will buy it from you, but never do that again."
Tom Haverford,That was really expensive moisturizer.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, you ruined all of my clothes."
Tom Haverford,"Well, then, I did you a huge favor, because they stink."
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hello, lovers."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Tom!
Ann Perkins,You're amazing!
Ann Perkins,Kiss me more!
Tom Haverford,Uhhuh.
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Enough of this.
Donna Meagle,"Y'all broke up a long time ago, didn't you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We're stronger than ever, so"
Donna Meagle,It's all right.
Donna Meagle,I'ma let y'all have this one.
Donna Meagle,"As someone who has lied a lot about various aspects of a myriad of relationships, I respect the effort you've gone to."
Donna Meagle,Let's call off the bet.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Donna Meagle,No problem.
Ann Perkins,I guess that's it.
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Tom Haverford,The end of a relationship.
Tom Haverford,And the beginning of a partnership.
Tom Haverford,"Let's talk ""Sparkle Skin."""
Tom Haverford,Do we know anyone in product development over at Sephora?
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of me and April making out in her apartment.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of us making out in Ben's office.
Andy Dwyer,"This is a picture oh, this is us making out I don't know where that is, but you can tell that she's sucking on my lip."
Andy Dwyer,Traveling.
Andy Dwyer,"Making out are you okay, boss?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be focusing on this river cleanup, but all I keep thinking about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,Who's Hot Rebecca?
Leslie Knope,She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.
Leslie Knope,"I combined all of the giant, darkhaired, smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,Ah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs."
Leslie Knope,I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.
Andy Dwyer,"Everything's going to be fine with you and Ben, because if I know Ben, he, too, is an amalgam."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, you're better than Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,You're kickass Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,"Long distance relationships are never easy, but you never, ever give up on stuff."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes you
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Andy Dwyer,An amalgam.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, a word?"
Chris Traeger,Are you aware of what's going on out in your department?
Ron Swanson,I am.
Ron Swanson,My department is pouting because I didn't put on a puppet show based on the funniest email chain of the year.
Chris Traeger,I would have liked to have seen that show.
Chris Traeger,My nomination was Jerry accidentally forwards his bank statement to everyone.
Chris Traeger,Classic And depressing.
Ron Swanson,"The point of a barbecue is not to do hokey, office joke theater."
Ron Swanson,The point is
Chris Traeger,The point of the barbecue was to thank the department.
Chris Traeger,It was an employee appreciation barbecue.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I gave you the chance to become assistant city manager."
Chris Traeger,"And you chose to stay here, which is fine."
Chris Traeger,"But if you're going to lead the department, you occasionally have to lead the department."
Chris Traeger,And I say that as one of your closest colleagues and dearest friends But also as your boss.
Leslie Knope,I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.
Leslie Knope,"But things move pretty slow in Washington, and I'm not going to wait around."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I was recently reminded by someone that I'm not the type of person to shy away from hard work."
Andy Dwyer,"What? Did I, Do you need something from me right now?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"Point is, I'm going to clean up this river by myself."
Leslie Knope,"Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., I will be here."
Leslie Knope,Those are my office hours.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to come and talk to me or ask me questions or raise an issue, this is where I'll be."
Leslie Knope,"Let's get to work, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,The smell is so much worse when you get up close.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look, a handgun."
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Leslie Knope,Holy
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, get in here now! Your work is appreciated."
Ron Swanson,Eat some corn.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, boss."
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Also, here's Tom."
Ann Perkins,Aah! It actually smells really delicious.
Donna Meagle,It really does.
Tom Haverford,Give me some of Tommy's ribs.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, heck, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Tom."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,That's good.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, if I'd known it didn't go well with the guy from Interior, I"
Leslie Knope,"No, No, no."
Leslie Knope,You did nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you and how much everyone loves you and how great you're doing.
Leslie Knope,I just freaked out.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Long distance sucks.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Leslie Knope,"But we can do this, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, definitely."
Ben Wyatt,Can you come visit next month? We can take a proper tour of the sights.
Leslie Knope,There's only one sight I want to see right now.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, I mean, this is getting weird, but, uh, there it is."
Leslie Knope,"I meant the Jefferson Memorial, you perv."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I don't, uh I'm I'm just Wait."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you didn't."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,Spin it around and back it on up.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Andy Dwyer,The White House America's most whitest house most notably is where Sinbad lived in the film First Kid.
April Ludgate,"Sinbad, wow."
April Ludgate,The other tour guide never said anything about that.
Andy Dwyer,Do you know why it's called the Oval Office? No.
Andy Dwyer,Because of a man Oval Redenbacher
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,Popcorn inventor.
Andy Dwyer,He used to hang out with John F. Kennedy.
