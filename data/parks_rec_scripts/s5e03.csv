Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,I miss you.
Ben Wyatt,"I miss you, too."
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,I'm in my new city council office.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Leslie Knope,"I know, do you like it?"
Ben Wyatt,I love it.
Leslie Knope,"I love it, too."
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,Here is my wall of inspirational women.
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a picture of you?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.
Leslie Knope,Here are my clocks.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee and Washington D.C.
Ben Wyatt,Same time zone.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the coolest part ever."
Leslie Knope,I have my own private bathroom.
Jeremy Jamm,Occupied!
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Jamm.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Jeremy Jamm,I don't known if i would call it your bathroom.
Leslie Knope,Its only door is in my office.
Jeremy Jamm,I think it is crazy that the most junior city councilor gets a private bathroom just because she is a girl.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Jeremy Jamm,Let's solve this.
Jeremy Jamm,Tell you what I'm going to do.
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm going to drop my liquids in here, take my solids down the hall."
Jeremy Jamm,Deal?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No deal.
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,Your loss.
Leslie Knope,How?
Chris Traeger,Fun fact about me.
Chris Traeger,I recently began intensive psychotherapy.
Chris Traeger,I may have mentioned that to you already.
Ron Swanson,Several times.
Chris Traeger,"Well, like my therapist says, ""You can't share too much or too often."""
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Gayle and I, we saw a couples therapist for a little while."
Chris Traeger,"That's too much, Jerry."
Donna Meagle,For real.
Donna Meagle,Keep us out your bedroom.
Chris Traeger,"It used to be, when I was down, I called my mother."
Chris Traeger,"When I lacked selfconfidence, I called my running coach."
Chris Traeger,"And now, no matter what emotion I'm feeling, I call one number my therapist."
Chris Traeger,I want to do the same thing for the city.
Andy Dwyer,A psychotherapist for the city.
Chris Traeger,"No, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Chris Traeger,A 311 line.
Chris Traeger,Citizens will call 311 for whatever problem they have.
Chris Traeger,"Uncollected garbage, broken streetlight, and we will direct them to the proper department."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, great idea."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,I agree.
Chris Traeger,I love this idea.
Chris Traeger,And I love me for thinking of it.
Chris Traeger,My therapist said that I need to be more vocal about appreciating myself.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,"You're welcome, Chris."
Chris Traeger,I sound insane.
Chris Traeger,I'm going to go talk to my therapist.
Joan Callamezzo,Welcome to Pawnee Today.
Joan Callamezzo,I am first rate newswoman Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,Pawnee's City Council approval rate is at a dismal 3%.
Joan Callamezzo,That's an all time low.
Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, the city council has done very little over the past few years, and what they have accomplished, in my opinion, has been embarrassing."
Joan Callamezzo,And that is a fact.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,That's the definition of an opinion.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,"The city council has some political gridlock and some partisan bickering, but we're actually about to pass a bill my bill the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act, which will extend public pool hours citywide."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can you say, ""big whoop""?"
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, ""Absolutely."""
Leslie Knope,Because not only am I a city councilor.
Leslie Knope,I'm a city councilor with porpoise.
Leslie Knope,"By passing the bill, and extending pool hours, we are saying to our citizens that this City Council is determined to better our town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team, I have a question for you."
Leslie Knope,What is your greatest accomplishment?
Extra,We came in fourth in the County swim meet last year.
Leslie Knope,"Wrong, your greatest accomplishment is happening in two hours when this bill becomes law."
Tom Haverford,Yay.
Leslie Knope,"I just want you to be very proud of yourselves, because this bill is going to start a long romance between the city and its government."
Leslie Knope,Porpoise call!
Extra,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"I'm doing a porpoise call, which we used to do when I was part of your group, but it seems like you don't do it any more and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,I'm not weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody leave."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the city council meeting.
April Ludgate,"Hey, are you busy?"
April Ludgate,And writing Star Trek fan fiction does not count.
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha ha.
Ben Wyatt,I finished it last week.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"Um, I miss Andy."
April Ludgate,"And you probably miss your lover, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
April Ludgate,I had an idea.
April Ludgate,It's Friday.
April Ludgate,Pawnee's only a tenhour drive.
April Ludgate,Road trip?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know, I was going to try to get a jump on some work this weekend."
April Ludgate,"Dude, 30 years from now, when you're on your deathbed, what are you going to remember?"
April Ludgate,Organizing files or taking a spontaneous road trip to surprise Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"All right, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we might be able to sneak out early."
Ben Wyatt,You get snacks.
Ben Wyatt,I'll bring music.
Ben Wyatt,We'll jam out to some sweet tunage.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,This is awesome.
April Ludgate,"Actually, no."
April Ludgate,I don't want to go any more.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,See you in ten minutes.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,We're not going.
April Ludgate,Road trip!
Ben Wyatt,So we're going?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm excited to bond a little with April."
Ben Wyatt,She's like the little sister I never had.
Ben Wyatt,Because the little sister I do have is normal and not terrifying.
Andy Dwyer,311
Ron Swanson,"Well, Diane, for potholes, you want to speak with Public Works."
Ron Swanson,I understand you've tried them four times.
Ron Swanson,Government is inefficient and should be dissolved.
Ron Swanson,Please hold while I transfer you.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, can you help me?"
Jerry Gergich,"I got a 311 call, but it was all static."
Donna Meagle,That sounds like an I.T. Problem.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, how do I get I.T. here?"
Donna Meagle,Call 311.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hello again, Diane."
Ron Swanson,Nobody answered?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you know what?"
Ron Swanson,Someone will be there shortly.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, get your lunch, some water, and a 40 pound bag of asphalt."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, boss."
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?
Ron Swanson,We're fixing a pothole.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Jerry Gergich,Pawnee 311.
Jerry Gergich,"How can I help Oh, no."
Jerry Gergich,"No, this is not 911."
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,This is 311.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, they switched my phone with 911."
Jerry Gergich,What do I do?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Try to help.
Donna Meagle,Now hush.
Donna Meagle,It is heating up in this piece.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that sounds awful."
Ben Wyatt,"Good lord, it is hot."
April Ludgate,"Yes, mercy me."
April Ludgate,Living in this town's like living in the devil's butt crack.
Ben Wyatt,Almost out of gas.
Ben Wyatt,I'll wait till we're on the highway.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the GPS says we should take 495 to 270, but check out this cool alternate route I found"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that is so interesting to me because I'm a map salesman."
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
Ben Wyatt,Because.
Ben Wyatt,Other cars.
Ben Wyatt,Will you not do that?
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
April Ludgate,That's what you do when you
Ben Wyatt,Please don't do
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, great, here comes a guy."
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
Extra,Mmhmm?
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
Extra,Exit's closed for a bit.
Extra,Presidential motorcade.
Ben Wyatt,I'll just shut off the car till it opens up.
Ben Wyatt,"Holy [Bleep], it's hot."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"Beautiful, Tom."
Jeremy Jamm,Beautiful.
Jeremy Jamm,Dynamite gums.
Tom Haverford,"Aw, thanks."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tom, do you want to know why I moved to Pawnee?"
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Jeremy Jamm,It's because the two leading industries here are corn syrup and rubber nipples.
Jeremy Jamm,It is a dentistry jackpot.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's genius, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, D.D.S."
Tom Haverford,"Doesn't stand for ""dumb, dumb, stupid."""
Jeremy Jamm,I like that.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to steal it.
Jeremy Jamm,That's mine now.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Councilman Jamm and I have gotten pretty tight.
Tom Haverford,"And I'm hoping to parlay this into a membership at the Pawnee Smokehouse, Pawnee's most exclusive cigar club."
Tom Haverford,"Overstuffed leather chairs, top shelf brandies."
Tom Haverford,"And that stale tobacco stench that says, ""Welcome to the top."""
Tom Haverford,"You're a member of the Pawnee Smokehouse, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Man, I love a good stogie."
Tom Haverford,I actually just had this personalized cigar cutter made.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa.
Jeremy Jamm,Real nice.
Jeremy Jamm,"Not my initials, but thank you so much."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, well, it's not Okay."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, so, uh, we're still all good on Leslie's bill, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Actually, Tommy, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,I have wanted this perm since middle school.
Leslie Knope,I could not be more excited about this.
Leslie Knope,"Are you excited, Autumn?"
Extra,"Yeah, definitely."
Leslie Knope,Do you ever give a perm to someone and ever regret it?
Leslie Knope,Uh Ann has told me repeatedly not to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,But Ann's not here.
Leslie Knope,"So when the Ann's away, the mice get perms."
Tom Haverford,Councilman Jamm changed his vote.
Tom Haverford,He's voting no on fun in the sun.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,He promised me.
Tom Haverford,He just said that he changed his mind.
Tom Haverford,Then he told me some veneers could really make my smile pop.
Tom Haverford,Thoughts?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,The vote is in an hour.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to have an emergency strategy session now."
Extra,What about the perm?
Leslie Knope,"The perm must wait, Autumn!"
Leslie Knope,The perm must wait.
Extra,Wait So this means the bill isn't going to pass?
Extra,My parents said that you guys can't get anything done.
Leslie Knope,"Now, wait, okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,This isn't over by a long shot.
Extra,But it's three to two against us.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't be an alarmist."
Leslie Knope,It's very important that we stay positive.
Leslie Knope,Our positive attitude is our greatest asset.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, a word, please."
Tom Haverford,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"The bill is dead, the Porpoises are doomed, and democracy is over."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I decided to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,Ann should have never let me do this.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm saw you on Pawnee Today."
Tom Haverford,He knows how much you want this.
Tom Haverford,He's just trying to get something in return.
Tom Haverford,This is a bargaining tool.
Leslie Knope,"You know, this is why people hate the government."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause just when we're about to do something really good, it all falls apart due to some stupid, selfish jerk butt."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Screw Jamm.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to try to get Councilman Milton's vote.
Tom Haverford,Milton?
Tom Haverford,"He's, like, 150 years old."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He's got grandkids, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And and kids love to swim.
Leslie Knope,And he'll give us his vote.
Leslie Knope,"He's an old person, and I'll talk to him really slowly."
Leslie Knope,He won't even know what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,I just need to hurry up.
Leslie Knope,How do I look?
Tom Haverford,I don't know how to answer that.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, I'm Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I really like your dress.
Zoe Lewis,I'm a princess.
Ivy Lewis,I'm a mermaid.
Ron Swanson,I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix that hole.
Zoe Lewis,This is our kingdom.
Zoe Lewis,You have to ask permission.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me?
Andy Dwyer,"Your highnesses, we do humbly request thine permission to befix doth holes yonder."
Ivy Lewis,Only if you can tag us.
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Ron Swanson,Your tax dollars at work.
April Ludgate,"Soundtrack to Pulp Fiction, soundtrack to Singles, soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank."
April Ludgate,Why do you have so many soundtracks?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, uh, I kind of look at it like it's your favorite directors making a mix tape just for you."
April Ludgate,Eww.
April Ludgate,"Oh, here's something."
April Ludgate,"""Benji's Cool Times Summer Jamz Mix."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I you probably don't want to listen to that"
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to listen to it."
Ben Wyatt,Just 'cause
Ben Wyatt,"no, listen, it"
April Ludgate,I want to listen to it.
Ben Wyatt,We don't we don't
April Ludgate,I wanna hear what's on it.
Ben Wyatt,We don't need to April
Music,"Shoop Ooh, how you doin'?"
Music,"Here I go, here I go, here I go again girl, what's my weakness?"
April Ludgate,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Don't judge me.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I'd like to talk to you about the Fun In The Sun bill, and I don't mean to rush you, but the vote is in an hour."
Councilman Milton,"When I'm done eating, we'll talk."
Councilman Milton,I've eaten the same lunch for 58 years.
Councilman Milton,"Caesar salad, extra dressing, extra croutons, and extra anchovies."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton was first elected as a city councilor in 1948, as a member of the Dixiecrat Party."
Leslie Knope,Their platform?
Leslie Knope,"""Deintegrate Baseball."""
Councilman Milton,The secret is in the dressing.
Councilman Milton,Try it.
Councilman Milton,It's an aphrodisiac.
Councilman Milton,"You too, my strange, foreign friend."
Tom Haverford,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, eat some."
Tom Haverford,I'm not eating racist salad.
Leslie Knope,"The more we eat, the faster we talk."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,You can really taste the ignorance.
Councilman Milton,"It's pronounced ""anchovies."""
Diane Lewis,Hi.
Diane Lewis,Diane Lewis.
Diane Lewis,I own this pothole.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix it.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, seaweed choke!"
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,That large boy is my colleague.
Ron Swanson,We work at the Parks Department.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, you're not even from the Public Works Department?"
Ron Swanson,"Look, it appeared that no one from the proper channels was gonna fix this, so I decided to do it myself."
Diane Lewis,Do you know what you're doing?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, you have grandchildren"
Councilman Milton,And seven great grandkids.
Councilman Milton,"Tim, Mary, Jack, uh, Tim, Marie, Tim, and Mary."
Tom Haverford,Don't forget about Tim.
Councilman Milton,"Right, Tim."
Councilman Milton,How many is that?
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's very hard to tell."
Leslie Knope,This might not work.
Tom Haverford,"Let me find Jamm, see if he'll bargain."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Councilman Milton,What country is he from?
Leslie Knope,Iceland.
Ben Wyatt,"""Data had never felt this way before."
Ben Wyatt,"Of course, data had never felt anything before."
Ben Wyatt,"But Captain Picard couldn't help but note ""the smile that crept over his mechanical but lifelike face."""
April Ludgate,I'm gonna murder you.
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ben Wyatt,"""As they walked down the hall into the bridge"""
Diane Lewis,Lemonade?
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Hey, I'm sorry if I was curt earlier."
Diane Lewis,"I'm a single mom, and sometimes things get chaotic around here."
Diane Lewis,When you showed up from the Parks Department
Ron Swanson,No need to apologize.
Ron Swanson,I understand completely.
Ron Swanson,This is delicious.
Diane Lewis,"Well, I got it from Food and Stuff, so"
Ron Swanson,That's where I got these gloves.
Diane Lewis,Right?
Diane Lewis,"So, how exactly are you gonna fix this hole?"
Diane Lewis,Just for my own edification.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, I dug the loose gravel out of the hole."
Ron Swanson,"Now I'm using a jackhammer to remove the larger pieces, then I'll spray down the hole to settle the dust and fill it with cold patch asphalt."
Diane Lewis,"Well, thank you."
Diane Lewis,Now I can fix the next one myself.
Andy Dwyer,Ron and Diane sitting in a tree k I s s I s s I p p I.
Andy Dwyer,Do you hear that bird?
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Support of one of your bills?
Leslie Knope,Committee chairmanship?
Jeremy Jamm,I want your toilet.
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,"Your office, with the private bathroom?"
Tom Haverford,He wants your office.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but, uh, I've got Irritable Bowel Syndrome."
Leslie Knope,This isn't even about policy?
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Tom Haverford,This is a nobrainer.
Tom Haverford,"Just make the trade, everyone's happy."
Leslie Knope,I'm not happy.
Leslie Knope,He shoots down a very helpful bill 'cause he doesn't get to poop wherever he wants?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton, and you can put your butt back in your pants, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, well, love the hair!"
Ron Swanson,"Andy, come help me tamp this down."
Andy Dwyer,"For the last time, Ron, it's princess rainbow sparkle."
Ron Swanson,Holy Moses.
Ivy Lewis,Can we turn you into a princess?
Ron Swanson,No.
Andy Dwyer,I think it would really make Diane happy.
Ron Swanson,Why would that matter?
Ron Swanson,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Ron Swanson,Would you please come help me tamp this down?
Ron Swanson,It's a job that requires two men.
Andy Dwyer,Or does it require two princesses?
Ivy Lewis,Please?
Zoe Lewis,Please?
Andy Dwyer,Please?
Councilman Milton,Oh.
Councilman Milton,This is impressive.
Councilman Milton,"You remind me of a young, beautiful Strom Thurmond."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I've been saying that for years."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?"
Councilman Milton,"Yes, indeed."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's a lot of salad dressing on your hand."
Councilman Milton,Shall we kiss?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No!
Councilman Milton,Aah!
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Councilman Milton,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, still be able to vote."
Leslie Knope,We can kiss if you want to.
Councilman Milton,With tongue?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No.
Councilman Milton,She tried to kiss me.
Councilman Milton,She was insatiable.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, maybe we should, you know, postpone the vote until the councilman gets better, you know?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah, we're not postponing anything, okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm pushing the vote through and it won't pass.
Jeremy Jamm,Complimentary toothbrush?
Jeremy Jamm,You're missing the backs of your upper canines.
Jeremy Jamm,Sloppy technique.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,I have excellent toothbrush technique.
Tom Haverford,Just give him what he wants.
Tom Haverford,Take the easy way out.
Tom Haverford,I always do.
Tom Haverford,It's so easy.
Leslie Knope,I do not negotiate with dentists.
Leslie Knope,"I'm trying to tell everybody that the government is great, and I think it stinks."
Leslie Knope,I hate it.
Leslie Knope,I hate the government.
Tom Haverford,You don't mean that.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I take it back.
Leslie Knope,"Why did I say that, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"God, you know me so well."
Zoe Lewis,More Rouge!
Diane Lewis,Everything going good?
Ron Swanson,"I came here to fix a pothole, not be mocked."
Diane Lewis,"I'm sorry, it's just-- your face is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,Thank you for the lemonade.
Ron Swanson,The asphalt will bear weight in an hour.
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, Andrew."
Andy Dwyer,"No! Wait, but we were gonna make a sparkle palace! Ron, you're walking across hot lava!"
Zoe Lewis,Oh!
Ivy Lewis,"Oh, no!"
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, it's moving."
Ben Wyatt,It's moving.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Finally.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
April Ludgate,What?
Ben Wyatt,No! We're out of gas.
April Ludgate,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,Aah!
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business, the Fun In The Sun Act, introduced by Councilwoman Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I move that the bill be read in its entirety."
Leslie Knope,Ms. Beavers?
Ethel Beavers,Fine.
Ethel Beavers,"Pawnee Municipal Code Amendment, 217-426"
Jeremy Jamm,"Buying time, I see."
Jeremy Jamm,What's up?
Leslie Knope,You can have my office.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, why don't you, uh why don't you sweeten the pot?"
Leslie Knope,You can have my parking space.
Jeremy Jamm,And?
Leslie Knope,And I will get Invisaligns from you.
Jeremy Jamm,And?
Leslie Knope,"And, that is enough."
Leslie Knope,And shut up.
Leslie Knope,And I hate you.
Jeremy Jamm,We got a deal.
Jeremy Jamm,Can't wait to drop my kids at the pool.
Jeremy Jamm,"By ""kids,"" I mean turds."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Then Ana asks Grey to punish her.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, please, can you keep it down? Or at least research how to deliver a baby that's coming out face up."
Jerry Gergich,Lay the mother on her side and try to move the baby in a corkscrew fashion.
Andy Dwyer,Diane is awesome and she likes you.
Andy Dwyer,And you like her.
Andy Dwyer,I can tell.
Ron Swanson,"""A,"" I don't recall inviting you in here, and ""B,"" I did not like her."
Ron Swanson,She's not my type.
Ron Swanson,Her life is messy.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, messy is fun, okay? My whole life is a giant mess and I love it."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, look at my hair."
Andy Dwyer,I have gum in my hair.
Ron Swanson,"Listen, I will not pursue Diane."
Ron Swanson,End of story.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, just steer."
April Ludgate,Be stronger.
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,That was a great road trip.
Ben Wyatt,We made it 40 feet.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, at least it took a million hours, and it was 180 degrees, and we starved to death."
Ben Wyatt,So fun.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about next weekend we fly to Pawnee? Tickets are on me."
April Ludgate,Really? That would be awesome.
April Ludgate,Definitely.
Ben Wyatt,"Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt,I don't feel like it.
April Ludgate,"What? Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,See how it feels?
Chris Traeger,"Excellent work, everyone! Particularly you, Ron."
Chris Traeger,You have one very satisfied citizen.
Chris Traeger,What did you do for her?
Ron Swanson,I fixed her pothole.
Chris Traeger,Is that a euphemism?
Ron Swanson,No.
Chris Traeger,Then great work.
Chris Traeger,"In fact, she's out in the hallway and wants to thank you herself."
Ron Swanson,"If you're here to complain about the pothole, I guarantee I did it correctly."
Diane Lewis,"Actually, I'm here to ask you out for dinner."
Ron Swanson,Really?
Diane Lewis,"Well, I hope you're not the kind of man who needs to ask the lady out."
Diane Lewis,I'm a middle school vice-principal.
Diane Lewis,I don't screw around.
Diane Lewis,Does that freak you out?
Ron Swanson,"No, on the contrary."
Diane Lewis,"So, dinner?"
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Well, it'll be casual."
Diane Lewis,No need to wear makeup.
Ron Swanson,I begrudgingly admit that the 311 program is a moderate success.
Ron Swanson,"I'm still not sure why the citizen decided to come speak with me in person, but I'm just happy to see a government program finally work."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get ready for the photo, guys."
Leslie Knope,I want you to arrange yourselves from most excited about democracy to least excited.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's excited? I bet you are! Because your bill just became law.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boy, you know, I can't believe you traded your office to keep this craphole pool open for a couple more weeks a year."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you not say that in front of the kids, please? I'm trying to teach them how great government is."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, this is a teaching moment? Great."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, uh, kids? Would you like to learn how Leslie got your bill passed? Councilwoman Knope traded my vote for her What the hell, man? Why'd you do that?"
Leslie Knope,"Um Um, because it's fun in the sun! Everybody in the pool!"
Tom Haverford,"Yay, pool!"
Leslie Knope,"Yay, democracy! Oh, no, my perm."
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Tom Haverford,Your new city council office.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And it is across the courtyard from your office, so we can wave at each other."
Leslie Knope,"But it is also Pawnee's newest and most exclusive cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse."
Tom Haverford,"Whoa! ""Smoke Dog."""
