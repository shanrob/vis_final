Ben Wyatt,God!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Ben Wyatt,What's happening?
Ben Wyatt,I can't hear!
Ben Wyatt,And I'm dying!
Leslie Knope,"Baby, relax."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to surprise you.
Leslie Knope,Open the bottom drawer and read the cake.
Ben Wyatt,"""Will you go to prom with me?"""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this just keeps getting weirder."
Leslie Knope,"Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom."
Leslie Knope,"So as a last minute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them."
Leslie Knope,"They also wanted to cut A.P. Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin."
Leslie Knope,"Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin."
Leslie Knope,"I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction."
Leslie Knope,"In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club."
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution."
Leslie Knope,Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, will you go to the prom with me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I thought you'd never ask, because we're nearing 40."
Ben Wyatt,Course I will.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Prom!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are making progress, prom committee."
Leslie Knope,"Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge of music."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.
Donna Meagle,Eew and boo.
Donna Meagle,This kind of thing is getting out of hand with you two.
Donna Meagle,Y'all are on official warning.
Ben Wyatt,I did DJ a little back in the day.
Ben Wyatt,"I had a show called ""Zoot Suit Wyatt"" on Carleton College radio."
Ben Wyatt,"Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M., I was the king of swing."
Tom Haverford,I thought we as a culture agreed to forget the year that everyone was into swing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ with Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Tom Haverford,What!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks."
Leslie Knope,So what do you got?
Allison,"I was thinking the theme could be ""Fairy tale."""
Allison,"The theater department did Into the Woods last year, and we still have the scenery."
Allison,I laid out some preliminary plans in this binder.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Are those jense-trodder color tabs?
Leslie Knope,I thought those were discontinued.
Allison,They were.
Allison,I had to order them through some Mexican back channels.
Leslie Knope,Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?
Leslie Knope,I thought they went out of business.
Allison,"They did, but they opened up a new one in Oaxaca."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody get back to work."
Leslie Knope,"And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's go over our set list."
Tom Haverford,Set list?
Tom Haverford,No need.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what, you're just gonna put your iPod on shuffle?"
Tom Haverford,"No, but I could."
Tom Haverford,You want to know why?
Ben Wyatt,Because every single song you own is a banger?
Tom Haverford,Every song I download has to pass a series of rigorous tests to answer one simple question: Is it a banger?
Tom Haverford,How many beats per minute?
Tom Haverford,How many drops?
Tom Haverford,How dope are the drops?
Tom Haverford,Were any acoustic instruments used?
Tom Haverford,"If so, it is not a banger."
Tom Haverford,I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.
Tom Haverford,I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're basically vibe curators."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing 10000 maniacs."
Tom Haverford,Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.
Tom Haverford,Thank God we don't have to be seen together.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we do."
Ben Wyatt,We're co-DJs.
Tom Haverford,Not anymore.
Tom Haverford,You're working with DJ Robo Drop.
Tom Haverford,"Badada, mm, mm, mm, mmmm"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I hope that this prom is exactly like my senior prom."
Andy Dwyer,"Theme: ""My heart will go on."""
Andy Dwyer,Photo booth with Monica Lewinsky lookalike.
Andy Dwyer,Afterparty Megan Rickerson's house.
Andy Dwyer,Her parents used to let us drink as much as we wanted.
Andy Dwyer,That'sâ¦ that's where we should have this afterparty.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, no, we can't, because they moved to prison."
April Ludgate,"Prom is nothing but a huge party full of smiling, dancing people enjoying themselves."
April Ludgate,It's literally my worst nightmare.
April Ludgate,And I hate punch.
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate, I'm gonna sing to you a song that I first wrote 15 years ago for my prom date, Sarah Weiss."
Andy Dwyer,"You're as hot as the sun but you're as cold as ice let me take you to paradise come on, roll the dice it will be twice as nice Sarah Wei-- April Ludgate will you go to prom with me?"
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Will you?
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I'll go with you, because Leslie's making us, and we live together, and we only have one car right now because you laked mine."
Jerry Gergich,"What does ""laked"" mean?"
Andy Dwyer,I tried to jump it over a lake.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you stay out of our conversations, Larry!"
Jerry Gergich,Will do.
Leslie Knope,"So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments."
Allison,Why are you showing me all this?
Leslie Knope,Because I think you have a real knack for public service.
Leslie Knope,"We here at the parks department have something called ""The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest."""
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I let her name it.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, it's a summer internship program."
Leslie Knope,I think you'd be great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to work here?
Allison,Definitely!
Allison,I'm totally interested.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,Allison Gliffert.
Allison,"Hi, Mr. Swanson."
Leslie Knope,You two know each other?
Leslie Knope,Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?
Leslie Knope,Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?
Leslie Knope,"God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing."
Ron Swanson,Allison's father owns the hardware store I've been going to since before Allison was even born.
Ron Swanson,What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?
Leslie Knope,That's what he calls city hall.
Allison,"Um, Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship, and I was thinking about taking it."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you shut your mustache?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"Tim Hautner, who owns the sawmill out on Lowell Drive, is a personal friend."
Ron Swanson,He's always looking for bright young employees to give money to in exchange for honest work.
Allison,That would be awesome.
Allison,I definitely need money for school.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen."
Ron Swanson,I have tolerated Leslie's pro-government ways because her annoying kindness and generosity sneakily made me like her as a person.
Ron Swanson,But I draw the line at corrupting America's youth.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I can get Allison a job at Tim Hautner's sawmill.
Ron Swanson,I once did him a favor.
Ron Swanson,I built his sawmill.
Leslie Knope,I may be leaving this office soon.
Leslie Knope,I need to plant seeds for the next generation.
Leslie Knope,"Interns become fulltime staff, become department directors."
Leslie Knope,Circle of life.
Leslie Knope,The seasons turn.
Leslie Knope,It's really quite beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts."
Andy Dwyer,Hee hee!
Andy Dwyer,Hah hah yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee!
Andy Dwyer,Class of '99!
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh!
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,"Girl, you look creepy."
Andy Dwyer,Would you like a drink?
Andy Dwyer,All this stuff is free.
Extra,"No, it's not."
April Ludgate,Why'd you pay for a limo?
Andy Dwyer,Because it's prom.
Andy Dwyer,"If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in."
Andy Dwyer,Does your mom want to take pictures?
April Ludgate,"Uh, yeah, she does."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,Orin!
Orin,Who's Orin?
Orin,I'm April's mom.
Orin,You two look adorable.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just take the picture already, mom."
Orin,My baby is all grown up.
Orin,Have her home by 11:00.
April Ludgate,"Mom, stop embarrassing me."
Orin,Say goodbye to your father.
April Ludgate,"Bye, dad."
Andy Dwyer,"Good night, sir."
Tom Haverford,This is all the stuff we have to work with?
Tom Haverford,Where's everything I requested?
Tom Haverford,Where's my smoke machine?
Tom Haverford,Where's my girls dressed in Teddy Bear costumes?
Tom Haverford,Where's my Yeezus Mountain?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Ben Wyatt,I specifically requested elliptical cartridges for the turntables.
Ben Wyatt,How am I supposed to keep my Husker Du albums in nearmint condish?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I have an idea."
Tom Haverford,Why don't you throw them in the garbage?
Ben Wyatt,"My prom was right after I got impeached, so I couldn't leave the house without being egged."
Ben Wyatt,But my parents threw me a prom in our living room.
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm still messed up from it.
Tom Haverford,I was actually only at my prom for 15 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"By the time I got my Armani suit pressed and got the little dimple on my tie just right, it was 11:45 P.M."
Tom Haverford,"My date was pretty pissed, but, uh, I looked fly as hell."
Principal Russell,"Leslie, thanks again."
Principal Russell,We just wouldn't have had a prom without you.
Principal Russell,This is Aplus work.
Leslie Knope,Aplus!
Principal Russell,"Thank you, Principal Russell."
Leslie Knope,Can I get that in writing?
Principal Russell,"Oh-ho, Leslie."
Principal Russell,You haven't changed since high school.
Allison,I can't believe he gave you an Aplus.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did he?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't even notice.
Leslie Knope,No bigs.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me closely.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?
Allison,"Ms. Knope, it'd be my honor."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hooray!"
Ron Swanson,Allison.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,I was subcontracted by the government to construct a lighting rig.
Ron Swanson,Would like to help me screw some angle irons onto some 2x4s?
Ron Swanson,I'll give you $40.
Allison,"Yeah, sure."
Leslie Knope,I'll just be over here having fun.
Leslie Knope,See you soon!
Leslie Knope,"I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you."
Leslie Knope,Mark my words.
Ron Swanson,Stop wasting helium.
Ron Swanson,It is intended for welding and filling air ships.
Ron Swanson,I attended prom with Susan Hofler.
Ron Swanson,"Picked her up in my truck, we slow-danced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry."
Ron Swanson,I was 12 years old.
Ron Swanson,Never went again.
Ron Swanson,Felt like I had outgrown it.
April Ludgate,"Well, we did it."
April Ludgate,We went to prom.
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,Let's go now.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding?
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Look around.
Andy Dwyer,The bloom of youth.
Andy Dwyer,Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I hate teenagers."
Andy Dwyer,"If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise."
Andy Dwyer,It's like the movie Expendables 2.
Andy Dwyer,"First time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,"Second time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,"Third time, it was okay."
Andy Dwyer,"But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something."
Andy Dwyer,It's just-- it's not good.
Andy Dwyer,It's not a good movie.
Andy Dwyer,"Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?"
April Ludgate,"Um, I'm gonna go to the girls' bathroom to check the trash cans for babies, but you can dance if you want."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,I love you!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Music,Money's the motivation money's the conversation you on vacation we gettin' paid so
Extra,"Uh, hey, no one's really feeling this."
Tom Haverford,"All right, not a 2 Chainz crowd."
Tom Haverford,I'll throw on some yeezy in a second.
Tom Haverford,Geezy?
Tom Haverford,Weezy?
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,You want some of that classic stuff.
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll break you off some of that Ja Rule."
Extra,Who's Ja Rule?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,How do you wha-- who's what?
Extra,"The stuff you're playing is so old, it's probably trinking on grizzledump."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's grizzledump?"
Tom Haverford,And why is trinking on it bad?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I don't know what's cool anymore.
Tom Haverford,"What's grizzledump, Ben?"
Tom Haverford,What's grizzledump?
Music,"This moment, we own it"
Leslie Knope,So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?
Leslie Knope,There's a little trick to it.
Leslie Knope,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a rope pulling motion."
Allison,So just pull the rope?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Allison,"Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you don't have to thank me."
Leslie Knope,Working for the government is its own reward--
Leslie Knope,"Run, Allison, run."
Ron Swanson,"You're wasting your time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hard earned dollar.
Leslie Knope,Don't listen to him.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons."
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.
Leslie Knope,That's what government is about.
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces.
Ron Swanson,"No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons."
Ron Swanson,"I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine."
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Leslie Knope,Pull the rope.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces.
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces!
Allison,"Uh, ermâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've ruined prom.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's having a terrible time.
Donna Meagle,I didn't go to my prom.
Donna Meagle,I was dating an older fella back then.
Donna Meagle,Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.
April Ludgate,"I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
April Ludgate,How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?
Donna Meagle,That's not true.
Donna Meagle,"He loves a lot of dumb stuff, but he loves you the most."
Donna Meagle,"If something's bothering you, just tell him."
Donna Meagle,It's always better to be direct.
Extra,"Hey, girl."
Extra,Are you ready to go?
Donna Meagle,I feel like I told you to wait in the car.
Extra,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,Be direct.
Ron Swanson,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,"You're finished, Knope."
Ron Swanson,"I just spoke with Tim Hautner from the sawmill on my mobile telephone, and he's offering Allison a paying job."
Ron Swanson,She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.
Ron Swanson,Beat that.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"And second of all, I already beat it."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna take that internship.
Leslie Knope,She pulled the rope.
Leslie Knope,There's no turning back!
Principal Russell,Leslie.
Principal Russell,Mr. Swanson.
Principal Russell,May I see both of you in my office?
Principal Russell,Now.
Principal Russell,It has come to my attention that both of you have been harassing Allison about her summer employment decisions.
Leslie Knope,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting."
Principal Russell,"I am disappointed in you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.
Principal Russell,Whatever's going on between you two and Allison ends right now.
Principal Russell,This is supposed to be a fun event for the kids.
Ron Swanson,"You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately."
Principal Russell,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity."
Principal Russell,"I have your word, then."
Principal Russell,This ends now?
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!"
Leslie Knope,Can we get a little music here maybe?
Tom Haverford,Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.
Allison,"Leslie, I told you."
Allison,I don't know what I'm doing this summer.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take this internship.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna fall in love with public service.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna rise through the ranks.
Leslie Knope,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.
Leslie Knope,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid."""
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, children."
Ron Swanson,Forget this happened.
Ron Swanson,Continue with your awkward close quarters gyrating.
Leslie Knope,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!"
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in."
Tom Haverford,Go ahead.
Tom Haverford,Play whatever you want.
Tom Haverford,Can't be any worse than this.
Extra,"Hey, I love this song!"
Tom Haverford,You actually like this?
Extra,"Yeah, dude, it's classic rock."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies!"
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Tried to use slang.
Ben Wyatt,That just came out.
Extra,I only listen to CDs.
Extra,It's the way music like this was meant to be heard.
Tom Haverford,But it's not even auto-tuned.
Extra,Where'd you get that dress?
April Ludgate,I was buried in it.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, huge news."
Andy Dwyer,I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.
Andy Dwyer,"He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.D."
Andy Dwyer,So I think he can get us all free beer.
Andy Dwyer,What's wrong? There's cupcakes and music.
Andy Dwyer,Why aren't you having fun?
April Ludgate,"Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane."
April Ludgate,"If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school."
Andy Dwyer,But that's because kids in high school are idiots.
Andy Dwyer,"The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,Let's bail.
Andy Dwyer,We got that limo for three more hours.
Andy Dwyer,I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Let's stay.
April Ludgate,I'll have fun.
April Ludgate,I promise.
Ron Swanson,"I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being."
Ron Swanson,"I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing."
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Leslie Knope,Saves a lot of time.
Ron Swanson,"If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05â¦"
Leslie Knope,They wrote all the team names in pink.
Leslie Knope,Nobody told them to do that.
Ron Swanson,I try to steer you back to safety.
Ron Swanson,A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down.
Ron Swanson,This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight.
Ron Swanson,I have the police on standby.
Ron Swanson,It's your move.
Leslie Knope,"I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago."
Leslie Knope,I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.
Leslie Knope,"You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, let's face it, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but you're hopeless without me."
Ron Swanson,Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand.
Ron Swanson,They're like blueprints for a house.
Ron Swanson,"Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them."
Ron Swanson,"One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else."
Ron Swanson,So enjoy yourself now.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.
Principal Russell,"Attention, please."
Principal Russell,The votes are in.
Principal Russell,And your Pawnee high prom king and queen areâ¦
Principal Russell,Lucy Taylor and Andy Dwyer!
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times."
April Ludgate,"You should get on up there, King Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,Not without my queen.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Pawnee High."
Andy Dwyer,"As your prom king, I'm your ruler."
Andy Dwyer,"Silence! My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it."
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.
Andy Dwyer,Always next year.
Extra,"No, there isn't."
Extra,I'm a senior.
Principal Russell,This is your wife? How old are you?
April Ludgate,"He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal."
Principal Russell,Get out.
Andy Dwyer,High school forever!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're having fun now."
Andy Dwyer,I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom.
Andy Dwyer,I can get on board with that.
Tom Haverford,My life is over.
Tom Haverford,I'm officially old and uncool.
Tom Haverford,Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool."
Ben Wyatt,It makes you a normal human adult.
Ben Wyatt,"You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses."
Tom Haverford,I guess that's true.
Tom Haverford,Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.
Tom Haverford,How else do you explain their terrible haircuts?
Ben Wyatt,"And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You're old as [bleep].
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,Glad I could help.
Leslie Knope,"Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas."
Leslie Knope,"You just have so much promise, we got excited."
Leslie Knope,You're a good kid.
Leslie Knope,"And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it."
Allison,I have to say I admire you both.
Allison,"You were right, Leslie."
Allison,"Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing."
Allison,But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded."
Leslie Knope,"Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death."
Allison,"Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend."
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Greg Pikitis,"What up, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Gregory."
Allison,You guys know each other?
Leslie Knope,You might say that.
Greg Pikitis,"Come on, baby."
Greg Pikitis,Let's get out of here.
Ron Swanson,"That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right?"
Leslie Knope,Offer is off the table.
Leslie Knope,She's a terrible person with terrible judgment.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
