Ron Swanson,"So, who broke it?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm not mad, I just want to know"
Leslie Knope,"I did, I broke"
Ron Swanson,"No, no you didn't."
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Tom Haverford,Don't look at me.
Tom Haverford,Look at Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"What, I didn't break it."
Tom Haverford,"Huh, that's weird, how'd you even know it was broken?"
Ben Wyatt,"because it's sitting right in front of us, and it's broken."
Tom Haverford,Suspicious.
Ben Wyatt,No it's not.
Jerry Gergich,"If it matters, probably not, April was the last one to use it."
April Ludgate,"Liar, I don't even drink that crap."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh really, then what were you doing by the coffee cart earlier."
April Ludgate,"I use the wooden stirs to push my cuticles back, everyone knows that Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, let's not fight, I broke it, let me pay for it Ron."
Ron Swanson,"No, who broke it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, Donna's been awfully quiet."
Donna Meagle,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah really?
Ron Swanson,I broke it.
Ron Swanson,It burned my hand so I punched it.
Ron Swanson,I predict ten minutes from now they'll be at each other's throats with war paint on their faces and a pig head on a stick.
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,It was getting a little chummy around here.
Tom Haverford,I need you guys to come to the Snakehole Lounge tonight to help me with something.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, no, tonight's not good."
Ron Swanson,No can do.
Donna Meagle,I'm on a cleanse.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,This is important.
Tom Haverford,"I'm launching my new high end, Kahlua style liqueur, Snake Juice."
April Ludgate,Sounds like you took a snake and twisted it like a rag until its blood and guts came out.
Leslie Knope,What does Kahlua style mean?
Tom Haverford,"I mix a bunch of alcohol together, I add some sugar and coffee and some other junk, and it kind of tastes like Kahlua."
Donna Meagle,I can only drink warm tap water with cayenne pepper.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Then don't drink it.
Tom Haverford,"Just get other people to drink it, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Meeting in one hour.
Tom Haverford,"If you don't make it, you're on my Donezo list."
Ben Wyatt,"What's a ""Donezo list""?"
Tom Haverford,It means you and I are donezo.
Tom Haverford,"Hanging out, getting food together, donezo."
Tom Haverford,You want to come over to my house and play video games?
Tom Haverford,Donezo.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Tom, you want to come play PuttPutt with me?"
Tom Haverford,"No, we're donezo."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we got to make that meeting."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so glad we found this time to talk ,it feels like it's been forever."
Ann Perkins,"I know, I've been so busy at the hospital, long hours, overnight shifts, getting sick of it."
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's start with the personal stuff."
Leslie Knope,How's Jessie?
Ann Perkins,Who?
Leslie Knope,The photographer guy.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,We broke up.
Ann Perkins,I didn't tell you that?
Leslie Knope,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I liked him.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I did, too."
Ann Perkins,I just I couldn't deal with his face.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, I'm technically out of the country."
Ann Perkins,So I would have to call him from a weird number.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Ann Perkins,"But I'm seeing this new guy, Mattias."
Ann Perkins,You would love him.
Ann Perkins,He's a triple Pisces.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, looks like someone's gonna be late for her meeting."
Leslie Knope,Race you.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Isn't that a little childish?
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, got to go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, move!"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Howser, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you as always.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to Guerilla Marketing 101.
Tom Haverford,What is Guerilla Marketing?
Tom Haverford,"A few ordinary schmoes, no offense, have a casual conversation next to some guy about how great Snake Juice is."
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know that guy orders a whole bottle of Snake Juice, and he has no idea why."
Tom Haverford,"April, you will be playing a boring beer drinker named Jennifer."
Tom Haverford,"Andy, you are also a boring beer drinker named Michael."
Tom Haverford,"Ron is going to play our exciting Snake Juice drinker, A.K.A. Brian Thunder."
Donna Meagle,You want us to memorize this whole script?
Tom Haverford,"Ideally, but if you want to wing it,"
Tom Haverford,"Your talking points are highend, VIP, lifestyle."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's run through it once."
Tom Haverford,And action!
Jerry Gergich,The weather has been so weird lately.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, let me buy you all a drink."
April Ludgate,I'll take something basic like a beer.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm pretty boring."
Andy Dwyer,"So I'll take a beer, too."
Ron Swanson,Not me.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get Krazzy.
Tom Haverford,Carazy.
Tom Haverford,Like crazy.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get crazy.
Ron Swanson,Get me a shot of Snake Juice.
Ron Swanson,I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
Tom Haverford,"All right, that's gonna be a cut."
Tom Haverford,"Um Ron, you got to say it like you mean it."
Ron Swanson,I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it.
Ron Swanson,"My only official recommendations are U.S. Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton Salt, and the C.R Laurence Fein two inch, axe style scraper oscillating knife blade."
Chris Traeger,We need to find a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,Dennis Cooper was fired today.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Chris Traeger,"Short answer, he went bananas."
Chris Traeger,"Long answer, his wife, Jan, had an affair, gave him a venereal disease, and so he put signs about her all through City Hall."
Chris Traeger,I'm sure you've seen them.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Chris Traeger,"""Jan Cooper will give you Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"""Brought to you by the Pawnee Health Department."
Chris Traeger,"""Chlamydia affects nearly 100% of Jan Coopers."""
Chris Traeger,"""The Department of Health congratulates Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,"""Miss Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"""Jan, I love you."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please come back."""
Chris Traeger,"""I realize that I'm not blameless here."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please."""
Chris Traeger,Brought to you by the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,"""Reelect Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,"""Mayor of Whoreville."""
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I want you to help us choose a replacement."
Chris Traeger,Parks and Health work closely together on outdoor programs and exercise initiatives.
Leslie Knope,Ann should do it.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Ann Perkins,"Pawnee is looking for a new PR Director for the Health Department, and I submitted your name."
Ann Perkins,You have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
Ann Perkins,"9 a.m., wow."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I know."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get it earlier.
Ann Perkins,I'm Grateful.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You can thank me later.
Leslie Knope,"But first, you need to go over your homework."
Leslie Knope,These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
Leslie Knope,So you need to partially memorize that.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen."
Ann Perkins,Why am I reading this?
Leslie Knope,"Because I'm almost done with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, deep breath."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I've been a nurse for over 10 years.
Ann Perkins,It's not something you just quit.
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"I just think with this new job, you could make a difference."
Leslie Knope,Make real change happen.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we'd be working in the same building."
Leslie Knope,No more lightning round catchup sessions.
Ann Perkins,It would be nice to have an office.
Leslie Knope,This is your destiny Ann.
Leslie Knope,You don't want to waste away at Pawnee St. Joseph's medical center and turn into her.
Extra,Ow.
Extra,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night."
Ann Perkins,You've mentioned that before.
Ann Perkins,That doesn't happen that often.
Leslie Knope,It happened once.
Ann Perkins,Just once.
Leslie Knope,That already is too many times.
April Ludgate,I hate talking to people about things.
April Ludgate,This is a nightmare.
April Ludgate,I'm grouchy.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we have to support Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I don't want to end up on that donezo list.
Andy Dwyer,Think about it as roleplaying.
Andy Dwyer,That makes it sexy.
April Ludgate,That could be fun.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Can I use a weird voice and try to freak people out?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Then next time you see me, I'll be a stranger."
Extra,"Hey, Tommy, I'm really hoping this booze of yours is going to sell because I am not going to take a loss on this."
Tom Haverford,Nothing this delicious will fail.
Extra,"Check back with me in a couple hours, I'll let you know how it's going."
Leslie Knope,Snake Juice!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Here?
Leslie Knope,"High end, VIP, exclusive."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going?"
Tom Haverford,I think it's going okay.
Tom Haverford,"People better buy this stuff, or else I'm gonna be screwed."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope,People will definitely buy it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"""K"" to the ""N"" to the ""OPE,"" she's the dopest little shorty in all Pawnee, Indiana."
Tom Haverford,"Why didn't you just stop at ""Pawnee""?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Leslie Knope, seriously, you get sexier every day."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And that is not a line.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That is for real.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, JeanRalphio."
Leslie Knope,So you're helping Tom.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Absolutely, and it's time to get that paper."
Tom Haverford,Get get get get get get that paper.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get get get get get get that paper.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Snake juice sales are going to be off the chorts, why, because that shiz is straight up deloicious."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay."
Leslie Knope,"I really do, but I have to go help Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
Tom Haverford,"She might be up all night, but I think someone else is gonna be doing the cramming."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy to see you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm seeing you here.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm surprised."
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, there was way too much stuff for me to read tonight, anyway."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, it was a ridiculous amount of stuff that you gave me."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,But you are going in for the interview tomorrow?
Ann Perkins,I think so.
The Douche,Uhoh.
The Douche,"Is there enough room for some ""manaise"" in this lady sandwich?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is my friend Howard Tuttleman."
The Douche,"Oh, please."
The Douche,"Call me ""The Douche."""
The Douche,"You probably know me from my morning radio show on 93.7, ""Crazy Ira and The Douche."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I had met you before."
Leslie Knope,I actually was on your show once--
The Douche,Wait!
The Douche,Were you on the show where we had that stripper do math?
The Douche,"Classic, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, strange person who I have never met before."
Andy Dwyer,Who are you?

April Ludgate,I'm a very rich widow with a terrible secret.

Andy Dwyer,Stealing the President's rubies.
Andy Dwyer,Now I work alone.
April Ludgate,Lovely to meet you.
Andy Dwyer,"I got to admit, I thought your costume would maybe be a little bit sluttier."
April Ludgate,How dare you?
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Swan song.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,How you living?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Why aren't you holding a Snake Juice?
Ron Swanson,I'm more of a whiskey man.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"RonRon, come here."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come here for a bit.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're good right there.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Listen, you got to jump on the Tommy Town Express."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This guy has some of the best investment ideas I've ever heard in my life.

Tom Haverford,"How about this, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Try Snake Juice.
Tom Haverford,"If you like it, you got to talk it up all night."
Tom Haverford,"If you don't, I'll shave JeanRalphio's head."
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'd like to see that."
Ron Swanson,Hit me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,A lot riding on this.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, if that isn't delicious."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"""R"" to the ""O"" to the ""N"" I say Swanson's got swagger the size of a Big Ben clock"
Tom Haverford,"Dude, you got to end it on the rhyme."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I know what I have to do.
Tom Haverford,"You had it at ""Ben."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I know.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I got it.
April Ludgate,You think I haven't been around the world?
April Ludgate,"I've been everywhere, darling."
April Ludgate,I'm a very wealthy woman.
April Ludgate,"My husband's kept me in the finest clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, you see."
Andy Dwyer,Freeze!
Andy Dwyer,FBI!
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,Leave me alone!
Andy Dwyer,Hands in the air!
April Ludgate,I didn't kill anybody!
April Ludgate,And I didn't burn down the mill either.
April Ludgate,My sister did.
April Ludgate,But now she's been eaten by wolves!
Andy Dwyer,Nothing to see here.
Leslie Knope,So how did you two meet?
Ann Perkins,We met at the supermarket.
The Douche,I used my classic pickup line.
The Douche,"""If you're looking for douches, they're in Aisle Me."""
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think I can get that book back from what's his name."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends."
Leslie Knope,They come and go so fast.
Ann Perkins,What are you saying exactly?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, let's be honest."
Leslie Knope,How long is it gonna last with this guy?
The Douche,Sitting right here.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"He's dumb, but he's fun."
The Douche,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, that's the whole point of dating around is you get to try on a bunch of different hats."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this hat is an idiot."
The Douche,Classic.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you mad that I came here?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not-- Are you-- You seem mad at me.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not-- I'm not mad at you."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad at you.
Ann Perkins,I'm not mad at all.
Leslie Knope,Neither am I.
Ann Perkins,No.
The Douche,Looks like you two need to kiss and make up.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"In general, I try never to speak with people, but I have been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good."
Ron Swanson,You should buy it.
Extra,"Yeah, okay."
Extra,"Thanks, man."
Ron Swanson,"Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee."
Ron Swanson,"Drink this, now."
Tom Haverford,Traegermeister!
Tom Haverford,You made it.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I got your email."
Chris Traeger,We need to talk.
Tom Haverford,"First off, though, try a little Snake Juice."
Tom Haverford,"It's 140 proof, which means it's 70% alcohol."
Tom Haverford,But don't worry.
Tom Haverford,There's plenty of caffeine in it to keep you awake.
Chris Traeger,I believe an ounce of that would literally kill me.
Chris Traeger,You emailed everyone at City Hall and told them to come to a club that you own to buy alcohol that you invented.
Chris Traeger,Government employees can't use their power to enhance their personal wealth.
Tom Haverford,"I totally get your point, Chris."
Tom Haverford,It won't happen again.
Chris Traeger,I just don't see any way around it.
Chris Traeger,You're gonna have to sell your shares in the Snakehole.
Tom Haverford,No!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"TPain, this guy bothering you?"
Tom Haverford,This is my boss.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, yeah."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want me to write a rap about your name?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"""B"" to the ""O"" to the double ""S,"" do what he say, and you'll be successful"
Ann Perkins,"No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, no offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings."
Ann Perkins,Offense!
Ann Perkins,That's rude.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go dance.
Ann Perkins,"Douche, you're up."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I heard yelling.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk."
Leslie Knope,Do you want to dance with me?
Leslie Knope,"Go get me another ""Snork Juice."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you."
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yes, I'm here."
Leslie Knope,Dance up on me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yes, yes, yes."
Andy Dwyer,How's it going with her?
Ben Wyatt,"Well nothing's going at all really, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like I just did something wrong, she just doesn't seem to want to talk with me."
Andy Dwyer,"You should try roleplay, that's what me and April do."
Ben Wyatt,That explains the outfit.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah you gotta dream up some weird scenario like you're her boss and sex is forbidden because she works for you.
Ben Wyatt,That is our actual situation.
Andy Dwyer,And she's addicted to spanking.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, we got it, we're good."
Leslie Knope,"If you're worried about working with Chris, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's fine with it, he said it wouldn't be weird."
Ann Perkins,You talked to Chris before you talked to me?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
Leslie Knope,"This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean."
Leslie Knope,All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
Leslie Knope,"You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid."
Ann Perkins,I don't understand how this is my fault.
Leslie Knope,It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Leslie Knope,Don't always make everything your fault.
Ann Perkins,Good!
Ann Perkins,It's not all my fault.
Ann Perkins,I'm not the stupid jerk.
Ann Perkins,I'm not the one who's being a stupid jerk right now.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,You know I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,"I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to do you a favor.
Ann Perkins,"Enough with your favors, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we shouldn't work together, then."
Ann Perkins,Maybe we shouldn't.
Chris Traeger,"Every time I cleanse, I can literally feel the toxins leaving my body."
Donna Meagle,I know!
Donna Meagle,I feel so much healthier.
Donna Meagle,I've still got a full week to go before the broth stage.
Chris Traeger,Prebroth is an amazing stage.
Chris Traeger,It's when you're most alert.
Donna Meagle,Good.
Donna Meagle,Someone needs to be alert tonight.
Donna Meagle,This Snake Juice is basically rat poison.
Donna Meagle,Everybody's wasted.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know one thing.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even say one thing.
Leslie Knope,"And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once."
Tom Haverford,"I'm like an elephant, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"If I walk into a room, it's like, okay, he's in there."
Ben Wyatt,Bababooey.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not gonna tell, that that bitch over there, I don't need to brag"
Andy Dwyer,Turn this music down.
Andy Dwyer,Farts and poop and love and stuff Macaroni salad
Ron Swanson,Is this everybody?
Donna Meagle,Ann took a cab.
Donna Meagle,Tom's in the trunk.
Donna Meagle,Jerry's on the roof.
Donna Meagle,"All right, where to first?"
Leslie Knope,Your mother's butt.
Tom Haverford,I'm so alone.
Donna Meagle,"If even one of you thinks about dryheaving in my car, you're all walking home."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,We have to go hire a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm so hung over.
Leslie Knope,I've never been this hung over.
Ben Wyatt,I feel great.
Ben Wyatt,I ran five k this morning.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I threw up in the shower."
Ron Swanson,"Top of the morning, everyone."
Ron Swanson,I brought some burgers and fries.
Ron Swanson,Eat up.
Ron Swanson,The protein soaks up the sugar.
Ron Swanson,"First, you take the cow to the killing floor"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am out of questions."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,We will let you know.
Ben Wyatt,"Then our heads will explode, and we will die."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sure you guys can work it out."
Leslie Knope,"I owe her, like, a million apologies."
Leslie Knope,"I think I owe you one, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,For what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sad."
April Ludgate,"Say, thanks, chum."
April Ludgate,I'll get those papers delivered for you.
Jerry Gergich,Whatever.
April Ludgate,Post haste.
Kyle,"The doctor says it's probably not serious, but it might be."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Kyle, please stop talking."
April Ludgate,"Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?"
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, and who is this sorry charlie?"
April Ludgate,I'm Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,"I demand answers, and I want them now."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, please."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, but Bert Macklin died last night after the tenth shot of Snake Juice."
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Miss Snakehole.
Andy Dwyer,You think I'd let you get away that easily?
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin may be dead, but I'm his brother Kip Hackman."
Kyle,Why wouldn't you have his same last name?
Andy Dwyer,"Shut up, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,I know you boosted those paintings.
April Ludgate,"Maybe it was me, but I'll never tell you where they are."
April Ludgate,And you'll never have my body either.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"T, you don't have to worry about a thing, because I'm gonna keep those shares real tight for you, real nice and cozy like."
Donna Meagle,"Sorry to hear the news, Tom."
Donna Meagle,We're gonna miss you around the club.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you own shares, too."
Tom Haverford,Why didn't Chris make you sell?
Donna Meagle,'Cause Chris doesn't know.
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,Snitches get stitches.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Donna, come on."
Donna Meagle,Don't.
Tom Haverford,I'm a natural moneymaker.
Tom Haverford,I got into government for the connections.
Tom Haverford,This was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing.
Tom Haverford,It's like when Vin did Boiler Room.
Tom Haverford,That's what led to him being xXx and doing Furious.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And Furious.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, I know."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Listen, I don't like all this negativity, man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Why don't you turn that ""frizzown"" ""upsidedizzity."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Huh?
Tom Haverford,"This sucks, man."
Ben Wyatt,You're wearing snow pants.
Ann Perkins,"I got home last night, and I thought I might go sledding."
Ben Wyatt,Can I come in?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, if you're quiet."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie doesn't know I'm here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,So high school.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe that Leslie and I got drunk in a bar and fought about boys.
Ann Perkins,We're so much better than that.
Ann Perkins,I just keep having flashes of things that we said to each other.
Ann Perkins,And she's so important to me.
Ann Perkins,I feel like such a dick.
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I don't know you that well, but you're clearly very important to Leslie"
Ben Wyatt,and that must mean you're a pretty great person.
Ben Wyatt,I know she feels awful.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, technically, we all do."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"What the hell is in Snake Juice, Demerol?"
Ben Wyatt,All I know is Leslie's always talking about how lucky she is to have you as a friend.
Ben Wyatt,And I just wanted you to know that.
Ann Perkins,You're nice.
Ann Perkins,I can see why she likes you.
Ben Wyatt,When did she say... Likes me?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,This is so high school.
Ann Perkins,"Just rent a limo, ask her to the prom."
Ann Perkins,I'm sure she'll say yes.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,So let me get this straight.
Ron Swanson,"Tom tries to get off the government teat, and we punish him."
Ron Swanson,That doesn't make any sense to me.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,Rules are rules.
Chris Traeger,I wish there was something we could do.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, is there something we can do? Damn it."
Chris Traeger,Ben's not here.
Ron Swanson,Tom's not scamming anyone.
Ron Swanson,He's not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that.
Ron Swanson,He's just a kid chasing a goofy dream.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,My hands are tied.
Extra,Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.
Extra,I just want everybody to know that.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,But we can't give you your job back.
Extra,You sound just like her.
Ben Wyatt,That was unpleasant.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"All right, who's next? You came."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I had some encouragement."
Ben Wyatt,Your sweater's on inside out.
Ann Perkins,And backwards.
Ann Perkins,It's been a tough morning.
Ann Perkins,Lots of regret and shame.
Ann Perkins,That should be the official slogan for Snake Juice.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass?"
Ann Perkins,"This candidate could, especially because this candidate also behaved like a total jackass."
Leslie Knope,"Please, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,The committee totally understands.
Ann Perkins,"Also, I can talk about my qualifications for this position."
Ann Perkins,"But first, I am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket."
Leslie Knope,Would you mind if I joined you?
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,Shall we? Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Chris Traeger,Great.
Leslie Knope,"She nailed it, of course."
Leslie Knope,But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
Leslie Knope,So they struck up a deal.
Leslie Knope,"She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world."
Leslie Knope,Win-win.
Leslie Knope,We need to remember what's important in life.
Leslie Knope,"Friends, waffles, and work."
Leslie Knope,"Or waffles, friends, work."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,But work is third.
The Douche,"So listen, Crazy Ira, check this out, okay? I'm at this club last night just killing it, the Snakehole Lounge."
Crazy Ira,"Oh, yeah, is that a gay club? Hello? Shut up, ass."
The Douche,"Come on, man."
The Douche,So I'm dancing on the floor with this super-hot chick.
Extra,Me so horny.
Crazy Ira,"More like a dude, I bet."
Crazy Ira,Hello? Did you wet your whistle? I wish.
Extra,Me likey.
The Douche,"No, no, no, no."
The Douche,"She spent the whole night talking to her friend, arguing about their feelings."
Leslie Knope,That's me!
The Douche,Who knows? She's probably a lesbian.
The Douche,They were in the bathroom a long time.
