Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Did I scare you?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that sounds cool."
Ben Wyatt,That sounds like something that will be a big success.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, like everything that you put your paws on."
Ben Wyatt,Your fingers.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, great news."
Chris Traeger,Do you remember the woman I told you about from the county commissioner's office?
Ben Wyatt,Um... Vaguely.
Chris Traeger,Sure you do.
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, she's agreed to go out on a date with you."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,You asked her out for me?
Chris Traeger,You're going to love her.
Chris Traeger,"She is interesting, smart and beautiful."
Chris Traeger,Inside and out.
Chris Traeger,Inner beauty is very important.
Chris Traeger,And outer beauty is also very important.
Leslie Knope,I thought you had a rule about intergovernment relationships.
Chris Traeger,Don't worry.
Chris Traeger,Her department is completely separate from ours.
Chris Traeger,This isn't anything like your affair with Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,We weren't You You
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, who are you calling?"
Extra,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Guess who is standing in this room with me right now.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, uh Ben Wyatt."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, say hello."
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Cindy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,No apology necessary.
Extra,It's just Chris being Chris.
Ben Wyatt,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Ooh!
Chris Traeger,Sparks are flying!
Chris Traeger,We may have to call the fire department.
Chris Traeger,It's a government joke.
Chris Traeger,I love setting people up.
Chris Traeger,Here's my secret.
Chris Traeger,"I determine someone's best qualities, and then, I find someone else with compatible qualities, and I bring them together."
Leslie Knope,"God, this sucks."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just go home for the rest of the day?
Leslie Knope,"I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules."
Leslie Knope,I feel so
Ann Perkins,Powerless.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm like that light bulb.
Leslie Knope,"Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with."
Ann Perkins,You know what might make you feel better?
Leslie Knope,A hug?
Ann Perkins,Paxil.
Ann Perkins,Do you want me to get you a prescription?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom!"
Ben Wyatt,A question for you.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anyone who's looking for a roommate?
Tom Haverford,How hot?
Ben Wyatt,I-- What?
Tom Haverford,How hot is the woman that's looking for a place to stay?
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's me."
Ben Wyatt,I'm looking.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,That's not fair.
Tom Haverford,You shouldn't have led me to believe it was a beautiful woman.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't.
Ben Wyatt,I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wakeup calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,"""Four stars,"" says nobody."
Tom Haverford,"I wish I could help you, Benihana, but I can't."
Tom Haverford,I have a one bedroom.
Tom Haverford,I can't have a dude sleeping on my couch if and when I bring home a lady.
Tom Haverford,"I have a ritual, and it starts on the couch."
Tom Haverford,"We sit down, clap my hands, lights dim."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Tom Haverford,Boyz II Men.
Tom Haverford,Fades in.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, stop."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you don't need to explain the ritual."
Ben Wyatt,I'm good.
Tom Haverford,You know who might be able to help out a homeless dude such as yourself?
Andy Dwyer,This is awesomely perfect.
Andy Dwyer,"Burly just moved in with his rich girlfriend, and we need help with the rent."
April Ludgate,"We have a couple of house rules, though."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sure."
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
April Ludgate,You can't use the front door.
April Ludgate,You have to climb in through the back window.
April Ludgate,No personal phone conversations.
April Ludgate,"If you ever speak to me in Spanish, please use the formal ""usted""."
April Ludgate,And no electricity after 6:00 p.m.
Andy Dwyer,She's joking.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,You can use as much free electricity as you want.
Andy Dwyer,It's free.
April Ludgate,Couple more rules.
April Ludgate,"If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying."
April Ludgate,"There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,She is lying again.
Ben Wyatt,She is.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Because it's hard to tell.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"We leave the TV on all day long so burglars think that we're home when we're not, which was my idea that I'm trying to patent."
Andy Dwyer,"So, you want to move in tonight?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,That would be great.
April Ludgate,You want my gum?
Andy Dwyer,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, can you make the opening remarks?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Ron Swanson,Neither am I.
Ron Swanson,Ever.
Ron Swanson,What's wrong with you?
Ron Swanson,You live for this kind of stuff.
Leslie Knope,I don't have it in me right now.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it for me.
Leslie Knope,Make the speech.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Give the speech, Ron."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I won't.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ron Swanson,No way.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes"
Ron Swanson,All right!
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Shut up and look at me!
Ron Swanson,"Welcome to ""Visions of Nature."""
Ron Swanson,This room has several paintings in it.
Ron Swanson,Some are big.
Ron Swanson,Some are small.
Ron Swanson,"People did them, and they are here now."
Ron Swanson,"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings."
Ron Swanson,Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.
Ron Swanson,I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further."
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Andy Dwyer,And that's the TV room.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's a mess."
April Ludgate,Can you throw that in the trash can?
Ben Wyatt,"I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding."
Ben Wyatt,What happened?
April Ludgate,"Well, Burly moved out."
April Ludgate,He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago."
Ben Wyatt,You guys made this mess in a week?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I always think April's going to clean up."
April Ludgate,And I never clean up.
Andy Dwyer,"It's cute, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
April Ludgate,"Yes, it is."
Ben Wyatt,Are you guys frying marbles?
Andy Dwyer,We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.
April Ludgate,It doesn't.
Andy Dwyer,The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.
April Ludgate,I think we found that in Ben.
Ron Swanson,"You forgot to paint a painting, son."
Jerry Gergich,"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag."
Ann Perkins,It's stunning.
Tom Haverford,"It's breathtaking, Jerry."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,It really is.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, guys."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's me.
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, it does look like you."
Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?
Tom Haverford,"That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,Topless Leslie glued to a horse.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I am just so, so sorry."
Jerry Gergich,"Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you."
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I'm going to take it right down.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leave it up.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car."""
Leslie Knope,Art can be so magnificent.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,The baby is Tom.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ann Perkins,This is easily my favorite painting ever.
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,Look at my pot belly.
Tom Haverford,I look like a pregnant baby.
Tom Haverford,And why am I so scared?
Tom Haverford,"All right, we've got to take this down."
Tom Haverford,Now.
Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.
Extra,"What, is that you?"
Extra,"Well, it's hot."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"This guy's in it, too."
Ann Perkins,He's the little fat baby.
Extra,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What's going on right here?
Tom Haverford,Baby rolls!
Tom Haverford,We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Extra,Thank her.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom."
Extra,She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good."
Tom Haverford,They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.
Tom Haverford,"In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the JayZ vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Aphrodite."
Donna Meagle,Chris needs you in his office.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer."
Extra,I don't know how to fix printers.
Leslie Knope,Learn it.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, should I go, too?"
Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's my painting.
Marcia Langman,Why am I upset?
Marcia Langman,Let's start with government funded animal porn.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.
Marcia Langman,"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality."
Leslie Knope,Bestiality?
Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse."
Marcia Langman,And how did it get like that?
Marcia Langman,Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution."
Marcia Langman,Destroy it.
Leslie Knope,Destroy it?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?"
Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?
Chris Traeger,"Not personally, no."
Chris Traeger,"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form."
Chris Traeger,I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
Chris Traeger,I've posed nude.
Chris Traeger,"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats."
Chris Traeger,"But I am not in the nude now, am I?"
Chris Traeger,Because we're in a government building.
Chris Traeger,"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying."
Chris Traeger,"So, take care of this situation."
Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.
Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia."""
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, roomie."
Andy Dwyer,How did you sleep?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were no bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, no bed."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go buy a bed.
Andy Dwyer,Fork.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"It's pretty cute, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you know what ""cute"" means?"
April Ludgate,What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?
Ben Wyatt,What have you guys got against washing dishes?
April Ludgate,"We don't have any dishes, okay?"
April Ludgate,Burly took them all when he left.
April Ludgate,"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
Andy Dwyer,We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.
Andy Dwyer,You've got to stay.
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to clean this place up.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,We'll get to be adults.
April Ludgate,"Gee, golly."
April Ludgate,"Thanks, mister."
Andy Dwyer,Fork.
Perd Hapley,Hello.
Perd Hapley,"I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard?"
Perd Hapley,With Perd.
Perd Hapley,Today's show begins now.
Perd Hapley,Is this art or is it pornography?
Perd Hapley,"Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art."
Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one."
Perd Hapley,But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.
Perd Hapley,You are the subject of this painting.
Perd Hapley,"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts."
Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.
Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Perd Hapley,Absolutely sure?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"So, you always separate your lights from your darks."
April Ludgate,That's racist.
Ben Wyatt,"And then, you get your laundry-- Where is your laundry detergent?"
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,Here we are.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This is bubble bath.
Ben Wyatt,You guys-- You wash your clothes in bubble bath?
Andy Dwyer,"Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, they both make bubbles, so."
Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Perd Hapley,Okay.
Perd Hapley,Also joining us today is a different person.
Perd Hapley,"Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx."
Brandi Maxxxx,Pleasure to be here.
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good."
Perd Hapley,When did you get into the business?
Brandi Maxxxx,Last year.
Perd Hapley,Fantastic.
Perd Hapley,"Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?"
Brandi Maxxxx,"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous."
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I do is obviously art.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
Brandi Maxxxx,"It's okay, Leslie."
Brandi Maxxxx,I got this one.
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or what have you."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,Pornography is very difficult to define.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."""
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, how would you define pornography?"
Brandi Maxxxx,"For me, it's when the penis goes in."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, we need to do some basic organization."
Ben Wyatt,Where do you put your bills when they come?
April Ludgate,I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Andy Dwyer,So they won't get lost.
Andy Dwyer,Bingo.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to pay these."
Ben Wyatt,Good thing I didn't lose them.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,New lesson.
Ben Wyatt,Basic finance.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.
Andy Dwyer,Bank account.
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Tom Haverford,"Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford,I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.
Tom Haverford,I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.
Brandi Maxxxx,You look familiar to me.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.
Tom Haverford,I'm a part owner there.
Brandi Maxxxx,That's you.
Brandi Maxxxx,In the painting.
Brandi Maxxxx,You're the fat baby.
Brandi Maxxxx,Aw! That's so cute.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,You're into that?
Brandi Maxxxx,No.
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,Imagine my horror.
Chris Traeger,I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.
Chris Traeger,"I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film."
Chris Traeger,I urge you not to take that role.
Leslie Knope,I am not going to take the role.
Chris Traeger,"That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Stand down, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This isn't your fight.
Chris Traeger,You've left me no choice.
Chris Traeger,"I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision."
Leslie Knope,Fine with me.
Leslie Knope,Public Arts Commission.
Leslie Knope,Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Chris Traeger,I would just like to introduce myself.
Chris Traeger,"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art."
Tom Haverford,"Council, I am not opposed to pornography."
Tom Haverford,"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it."
Tom Haverford,"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof."
Tom Haverford,"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong."
Extra,Please let the record reflect that the fat baby is referring to the painting.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I am not a fat baby."
Tom Haverford,"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs."
Tom Haverford,So let the record reflect that.
Tom Haverford,That I look like Tay Diggs.
Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art."
Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.
Leslie Knope,The Romans.
Marcia Langman,Perverts.
Leslie Knope,The Greeks.
Marcia Langman,Gay perverts.
Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.
Marcia Langman,Europeans.
Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself."
Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag."
Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, burn it."
Leslie Knope,What are you serious?
Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.
Extra,"Yeah but there's nipples in it, so I figure we ought to be safe and destroy it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list."
April Ludgate,Or we can buy a Wii.
Ben Wyatt,You can handle this.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know man, why don't you just handle it?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, I can't, I have a date."
April Ludgate,What's his name?
Ben Wyatt,"It's actually not, Chris set it up."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,"Point is, stick to the list and you'll do great."
Ben Wyatt,I have total faith in you.
Ben Wyatt,There's like a 30% chance they'll both die.
Marcia Langman,So how do you want to do this?
Marcia Langman,Burn it publicly or burn it privately and I put the footage on my blog
Leslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay"
Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to me
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Marcia Langman,"I say, this painting is going to burn."
Marcia Langman,"First here, then in hell."
Marcia Langman,Do I need to get this validated?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Marcia Langman,"Okay, I'll just pull my car around and you can load it in the back."
Leslie Knope,No.
Marcia Langman,"Hey, come back here."
Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena."
Andy Dwyer,This place is amazing.
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have a thing that makes sherbet, we need five of those."
Andy Dwyer,"No, we need to stick with what's on the list."
Andy Dwyer,"First things first, oven mitts."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the oven mitts?
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have all the as seen on TV stuff."
April Ludgate,Shake weight.
April Ludgate,Iron gym.
April Ludgate,Miracle hand repair.
April Ludgate,Big top cookie.
April Ludgate,Pillow pet.
April Ludgate,Slap chop.
April Ludgate,Oh my god a gopher pick up
Andy Dwyer,"Honey listen to me, get it all."
Andy Dwyer,"Grab everything that we've seen on TV, put it in this cart right now."
Andy Dwyer,"Iron gym, I am going to get so buff."
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, marshmallow shooter"
Andy Dwyer,"Marshmallow shooter, get two."
April Ludgate,Wait what about the magic bullet?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've seen that."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here."
Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?
Ben Wyatt,They're out shopping.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,I moved into the spare room.
Leslie Knope,"Really, huh"
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah sure of course."
Ben Wyatt,Why do they want to destroy it.
Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly."
Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.
Ben Wyatt,No no no.
Leslie Knope,It's very classy.
Ben Wyatt,"yeah no, I'm sure it is."
Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this."
Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope, you need to bring that painting back."
Leslie Knope,What painting?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have the painting, and you need to bring it back in."
Chris Traeger,"I think I've been pretty fair with you, and I'm beginning to feel angry."
Chris Traeger,"and I don't like feeling angry, my heart is racing, it's going at literally 45 beats per minute."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view."
Chris Traeger,"You will bring that painting in tomorrow morning, and surrender it to Marcia Langman, and that's that."
Chris Traeger,Do you understand me madam?
April Ludgate,Mighty Putty.
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?
Andy Dwyer,We didn't get a single thing that Ben told us to.
April Ludgate,Sure we did.
April Ludgate,We got the marshmallow shooter.
Andy Dwyer,I don't think that's on the list.
April Ludgate,But I want it.
Andy Dwyer,I want it too.
Andy Dwyer,But I also kind of want my own fork.
Andy Dwyer,"Because you eat really slow, which is cute, but also super annoying."
April Ludgate,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"What, what's wrong?"
April Ludgate,"Nothing, it's just adults are boring, and I hate them, and I don't want to buy all this stupid boring adult stuff and become boring adults."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey listen to me, yes we're going to get a dish rack and shower curtains and a cutting board, but if you think for one seond I'm not also going to get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows while you sleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know."
April Ludgate,You're going to make me cry.
Leslie Knope,You're a level-headed person.
Leslie Knope,What do I do here?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, it is one of the basic rules of government that you shouldn't offend people."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.
Ben Wyatt,Me too.
April Ludgate,Come back here.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey Leslie, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it."
Andy Dwyer,"I like it, it's very simple."
Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.
April Ludgate,"Oh my God, is that you as a naked horse."
Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't even
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, not to be inappropriate or anything, because you're my boss and my friend, but I would totally hit that."
April Ludgate,So would I.
Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and..."
Ben Wyatt,Okay
Leslie Knope,I'll see you later.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,Bye Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"So, how did we do?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, does this answer your question."
Ben Wyatt,"No, did you buy plates"
Andy Dwyer,Oh plates.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie what are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman."
Jerry Gergich,"Really, wow."
Leslie Knope,What?
Jerry Gergich,I mean to be honest that seems like the kind of thing I would do and I didn't think you would give in.
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Ben Wyatt,Hey man.
Andy Dwyer,"Roomie, dude, super fun to eat cereal from a bowl with a spoon."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.
Ben Wyatt,No problem.
Ben Wyatt,Though you know you're not supposed to bring your dishes into work right.
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Andy Dwyer,What's going on between you and Leslie?
Andy Dwyer,I noticed a weird vibe when we came into the room.
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing, we're friends, just regular friendship development."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, roomie, you can tell me, I bet there's something."
Andy Dwyer,I bet you I can guess what it is.
Andy Dwyer,She stole money from you.
Ben Wyatt,"What, no, no, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,She did not.
Ben Wyatt,I think we like each other.
Ben Wyatt,"But Chris has this very strict rule, coworkers can't date."
Ben Wyatt,So it's not even an option.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Well first of all, Leslie, she's like the coolest ever, you've chosen well."
Andy Dwyer,"and secondly, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen."
Andy Dwyer,"Look at me and April, if you're anything like us, three weeks from now, you'll be married my friend."
Marcia Langman,"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, I'm sure that's not an easy journey for you to make."
Leslie Knope,Let's take a look at it first shall we?
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, it looks amazing."
Leslie Knope,I had the artist paint over the original.
Leslie Knope,Feel free to destroy it.
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,But I think you'll find no one could possibly be offended.
Leslie Knope,Unless of course they have a problem with centaurs having modern haircuts.
Leslie Knope,"There were many kinds of Greek goddesses, some were lovers, some were warriors, and some were tricksters."
Chris Traeger,"I am so glad that this got resolved, because I hate being angry."
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Come in here.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,How did your date with Cindy go?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, she wasn't really my type."
Chris Traeger,Well she was a tall brunette.
Chris Traeger,You always like tall brunettes.
Ben Wyatt,Not exclusively.
Chris Traeger,"Historically yes, exclusively."
Leslie Knope,"He said he didn't like her, so it's over."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, well, I'm going to keep trying, because you are incredible."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,and you deserve someone amazing and smart and beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,A real goddess.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what about Shelly from the health food store."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know who that is.
Chris Traeger,Her brother died climbing Everest.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Chris Traeger,Interesting right.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Donna Meagle,Nice job Jerry.
April Ludgate,You look Enrique Iglesias.
Jerry Gergich,Just wish I had more time.
Tom Haverford,"Why, this is amazing, it looks like me and I look awesome."
Andy Dwyer,Is your penis between the front arms or the back legs?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, where's your penis?"
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Gayle, I know Jerry is your husband."
Leslie Knope,Look I can promise you there's absolutely nothing going on between us.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I did not pose for that painting, but thank you for thinking I did."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, sure, hold on"
Tom Haverford,"Gayle, sweetheart, you have nothing to worry about, okay."
Tom Haverford,"I'm not gay, neither is Jerry, and I didn't pose for him."
Tom Haverford,"I promise you hon, Jerry only has eyes for you."
Tom Haverford,"and pound cake, am I right?"
