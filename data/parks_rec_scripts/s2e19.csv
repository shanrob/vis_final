Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Time for the hummingbird lottery.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know how it works.
Leslie Knope,Write your name down on a piece of paper.
Leslie Knope,"No, they don't win a hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,"I installed hummingbird feeders in all the parks, so the winner gets to refill those feeders."
Leslie Knope,"Scientifically, hummingbirds are the world's cutest animals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're so small."
Leslie Knope,And they have tiny beaks.
Leslie Knope,And they only eat sugar water.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what beats that?"
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,They do.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Who's it going to be?
Tom Haverford,Not me.
April Ludgate,Not me.
Jerry Gergich,Not me.
Jerry Gergich,Not me.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,You can stop by tomorrow morning before work.
Jerry Gergich,This is my third time in a row.
Tom Haverford,"Just a bad luck streak, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Next time, I'm sure it will definitely be one of us."
Tom Haverford,But it won't be me.
Tom Haverford,Because I always writeâ¦
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"No, I always write my own name."
Leslie Knope,"But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra ""Jerry""s."
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti."
April Ludgate,I thought Freddy Spaghetti OD'd.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's Mr. Funny Noodle.
Leslie Knope,"And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him."
April Ludgate,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Where is Jerry, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,Why isn't he back?
Leslie Knope,How long does it take to fill bird feeders?
Donna Meagle,Maybe he fell into the toilet.
Donna Meagle,Remember when he fell into the toilet?
April Ludgate,"""Oh, sorry, guys."""
April Ludgate,"""Sorry I'm late."""
April Ludgate,"""I got confused and took a shower, after I got dressed, because I'm Jerry."""
Ron Swanson,"David Meyers, the Jewish guy who works at City Hall, once told me something."
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlemiel"" is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party."
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlimazel"" is the guy he spills it on."
Ron Swanson,"Jerry is both the ""schlemiel"" and the ""schlimazel"" of our office."
Tom Haverford,"""And then I put my underwear on my head instead of my butt."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,Unless somebody has another good one.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, is Jerry okay?"
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with your arm?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get Jerry to talk to me."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,He's okay.
Ann Perkins,He's got a couple of scrapes and a dislocated shoulder.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Jerry Gergich,You guys are just going to laugh.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,Did you throw out your shoulder trying to swing a honey pot off your hand?
Leslie Knope,I was mugged.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,I was on my way to the hummingbird feeders and I was walking Lord Sheldon.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon is my dog.
Jerry Gergich,My wife named him.
April Ludgate,Ew!
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, these kids, they came out of nowhere, they pinned my arm back, they grabbed my wallet, and they knocked me to the ground."
Ron Swanson,How did you counterattack?
Ron Swanson,Fist to the throat?
Ron Swanson,Did you hit him in the beanbag?
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.
Jerry Gergich,"No, I just curled up and laid still until they left."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's another way to play it."
Leslie Knope,Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?
Leslie Knope,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't get a good look.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,You're the victim.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I feel like we're responsible for this.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,We didn't mug Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?"
Tom Haverford,Because we tricked him into going there.
Tom Haverford,I don't see the connection.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,This is on us.
Leslie Knope,It's karma.
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,That's how pathetic Jerry is.
April Ludgate,He can't even get karma right.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's not funny."
Leslie Knope,Our friend got mugged this morning.
Leslie Knope,And we will not let that happen in vain.
Tom Haverford,He doesn't have a black eye.
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye."
Leslie Knope,"This is our wakeup call, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.
Leslie Knope,Our failure to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,I have some folders.
Leslie Knope,Inside are some assignments.
Leslie Knope,And some homemade taffy.
All,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're with me."
April Ludgate,"So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just check in with him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody dismissed.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,I want to help.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to teach everybody self-defense, so you can defend yourselves."
Leslie Knope,We need it.
Leslie Knope,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.
Leslie Knope,Especially Tom.
Tom Haverford,I am not a weakling.
April Ludgate,Arm wrestle me right now.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm more than holding my own here.
Andy Dwyer,"Three, four, fiveâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Six.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,How you doing?
Ann Perkins,Not too bad.
Ann Perkins,I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,He was mugged in the park.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry?
Andy Dwyer,The black guy with the Looney Tunes ties?
Andy Dwyer,I love him.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Jerry who works with Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,That Jerry?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He got mugged?
Andy Dwyer,Oh. Oh wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, that's kind of a bummer, too."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, while I have you here, what do you think of this?"
Andy Dwyer,Scrotation Marks.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no."
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,"Because ""Mouse Rat,"" it's a great name, but at the same time, it sucks."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I think we have to change it just one more time."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you've got to stop doing that."
Ann Perkins,How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?
Andy Dwyer,That is a really good point.
Ann Perkins,I always had fun with Andy.
Ann Perkins,"The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse."
Ann Perkins,He's completely helpless.
Ann Perkins,He's like a baby in a straightjacket.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,"""Baby in a Straightjacket."""
Ann Perkins,That's a good band name.
Ann Perkins,I should tell him that.
Leslie Knope,"Haha, guys."
Leslie Knope,Really funny.
Leslie Knope,Where's the real banner?
April Ludgate,We only had an hour.
Leslie Knope,So did I.
Leslie Knope,Look what I did.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,Welcome back.
Jerry Gergich,Really.
Jerry Gergich,"My gosh, you should not have gone to all this trouble."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's no trouble for our buddy.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,Listen.
Leslie Knope,Today is Jerry Day.
Leslie Knope,We'll do whatever you want to do.
Leslie Knope,Anything at all.
Jerry Gergich,"Honestly, what I would like to do is just have everything go back to normal."
Ron Swanson,That sounds good to me.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I believe you were going to do a presentation.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, sir, I was."
Jerry Gergich,I will go set up.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, you guys."
Leslie Knope,No jokes.
Leslie Knope,No comments.
Leslie Knope,Nothing but support.
Tom Haverford,He needs a lot of support.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Tom Haverford,Talking about a bra for a man.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, seriously."
Leslie Knope,That was the last one.
Jerry Gergich,"So, as we know, Spring Hunting Season is upon us."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, anyway, here's the info about the new licensing system."
Leslie Knope,Um Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't... I don't think your computer is plugged in.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,Just got to power up.
Jerry Gergich,First thing we should have is my graph about the season.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,Wait a minute.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That is not the graph.
Jerry Gergich,That's a picture from my vacation to Muncie.
Tom Haverford,"You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?"
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,My wife and I have a timeshare.
Tom Haverford,In Muncie?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city."
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, Hunting and Fishing Season is winding down."
Jerry Gergich,Okay?
Jerry Gergich,"And we all know that it's already closed season on ""twout."""
Jerry Gergich,"So, now I said ""twout"" instead of ""trout."""
Donna Meagle,It happens to everyone.
Jerry Gergich,My marbles are full of mouth today.
Jerry Gergich,You know what?
Jerry Gergich,Has anybody seen my glasses?
Jerry Gergich,I don't even think I canâ¦
Tom Haverford,"It says here ""1:00 meeting."""
Tom Haverford,And who are we meeting with?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,"Please, no."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers."
Leslie Knope,They are the first line of defense.
Carl Lorthner,Leslie Knope!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,"What's up, pencil pushers?"
Carl Lorthner,Haverford.
Carl Lorthner,"Good to see you, man."
Carl Lorthner,Is it hot in here?
Carl Lorthner,I feel hot.
Carl Lorthner,Are you guys hot?
Carl Lorthner,How you guys doing?
Carl Lorthner,I'm good.
Carl Lorthner,You guys got any snacks?
Tom Haverford,Carl is the head of all outdoor security.
Tom Haverford,"Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask."
Tom Haverford,Listen.
Carl Lorthner,"Hey, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner,Have you seen Avatar?
Carl Lorthner,I never saw Avatar.
Carl Lorthner,"I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar."
Carl Lorthner,What did you guys do for St. Patty's Day?
Carl Lorthner,"I was wearing this tshirt that said ""Kiss me, I'm Irish."""
Carl Lorthner,But no one would kiss me.
Carl Lorthner,So.
Carl Lorthner,You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.
Leslie Knope,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, you think you know how to do my job?"
Carl Lorthner,"Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens."
Leslie Knope,Kind of small feet.
Tom Haverford,"Actually, seven is the worldwide average."
Carl Lorthner,Boom!
Ron Swanson,Welcome to the emergency self-defense class.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers."
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?"
Andy Dwyer,"That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You understand that, right?"
Andy Dwyer,You wish.
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab."
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Ann.
Ron Swanson,Step up here.
Ann Perkins,I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.
Ann Perkins,"There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story."
Ann Perkins,"This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house."
Ann Perkins,And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.
Ann Perkins,"Also, her daughter was having sex way too young."
Ann Perkins,"So, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Free self-defense class?
Ann Perkins,I'm there.
Ron Swanson,And then just twist away.
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,Well done.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"What's up now, mugger?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, that was awesome."
Andy Dwyer,That was really good.
Jerry Gergich,"I don't know, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,I'd rather be back at the office.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong."
Carl Lorthner,You guys ready?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,We're ready.
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,"And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found."
Carl Lorthner,"It's got, like, fifty worms on it."
Carl Lorthner,"I call it ""worm log."""
Carl Lorthner,"Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman."
Carl Lorthner,"When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired."
Carl Lorthner,"But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired."
Carl Lorthner,"And ladies, too."
Tom Haverford,This thing is a mess.
Carl Lorthner,"We used to have three carts, actually."
Carl Lorthner,The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.
Carl Lorthner,"The second one, raccoons got onto."
Carl Lorthner,There was urine everywhere.
Carl Lorthner,And the third one was recently stolen.
Tom Haverford,What's this one?
Carl Lorthner,This is the second one.
Carl Lorthner,The raccoon piss one.
Carl Lorthner,All right.
Carl Lorthner,So we're going to just head out.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, no."
Carl Lorthner,You know what?
Carl Lorthner,I think we've got too much weight.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"That's Tom, probably."
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, can you get off, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Just run alongside the cart, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Carl Lorthner,"So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park."
Carl Lorthner,Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.
Carl Lorthner,It's primarily grass.
Carl Lorthner,"All right, I'm going to make a hard left here."
Carl Lorthner,"Stick with us, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Lesson learned.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Next.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Impressive.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about that.
Ron Swanson,Just try to escape my attack.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counterstrike?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"When you get out, you may counterattack."
Andy Dwyer,"But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I see where we're going with this.
Ron Swanson,"Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, hold up."
Andy Dwyer,Get off!
April Ludgate,Let him go.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ron Swanson,Oops.
Carl Lorthner,Any of this looking familiar?
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,It happened right over there.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, yeah."
Carl Lorthner,I'm not surprised.
Carl Lorthner,Take a look at this path.
Carl Lorthner,"With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light."
Carl Lorthner,There's been 10 assaults already this year.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?
Carl Lorthner,We have!
Carl Lorthner,Who do you think they're assaulting?
Carl Lorthner,I'm sorry.
Carl Lorthner,I didn't mean to yell.
Leslie Knope,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town."
Tom Haverford,You guys have got to slow down.
Tom Haverford,Can I just take a rest for a minute?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,No can do.
Leslie Knope,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.
Leslie Knope,"Let's roll, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,Going fast.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what day is it today?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
April Ludgate,"Okay, but to be fair, you never know."
Andy Dwyer,That's kind of true.
Andy Dwyer,I'm super bad at days.
Andy Dwyer,"But honestly, I'm fine."
Ron Swanson,"Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son."
Andy Dwyer,No worries.
Andy Dwyer,"Will you show me how to do that move, though?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,I can teach you right now--
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think."
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more water?
Ann Perkins,Or maybe some pancakes?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,What is the first move in any fight?
Andy Dwyer,Punch to the balls.
Joan Callamezzo,We've all heard the old saying.
Joan Callamezzo,"""Parks are supposed to be fun."""
Joan Callamezzo,"But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas."
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, tell us your story."
Leslie Knope,"This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,Diabetic.
Leslie Knope,Sloppily out of shape.
Leslie Knope,Friend.
Leslie Knope,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,Your frumpy uncle?
Leslie Knope,Your simple neighbor?
Leslie Knope,Your unpopular coworker?
Leslie Knope,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing."
Joan Callamezzo,"So, what is the solution to fix this?"
Joan Callamezzo,To make it right.
Joan Callamezzo,And not bad.
Leslie Knope,We need money from City Hall.
Leslie Knope,And it's not coming through.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you."
Joan Callamezzo,"Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat."
Paul,What possessed you to do that?
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park."
Paul,I don't care how upset you are.
Paul,You do not badmouth your own government on TV.
Paul,I'm sure you'll be happy to know your little stunt worked.
Paul,The Mayor is going to divert 2500 dollars to the Parks for security upgrades.
Paul,There's going to be an announcement tomorrow at 10:00 in the press room.
Paul,So... Make sure you bring the doofus who got his ass kicked.
Leslie Knope,I don't know who you're referring to.
Leslie Knope,We treat everyone with respect around here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Paul,Good morning.
Paul,"As many of you know, there was an incident involving a government employee in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you nervous?"
Leslie Knope,Just talk about how hard it was for you.
Leslie Knope,Speak from the heart.
Leslie Knope,You'll be fine.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't mugged.
Paul,...safety of our citizens.
Paul,That's why we're here today to give Pawneeâ¦
Paul,Jerry?
Paul,Why don't you step on up here?
Leslie Knope,"No, I will."
Leslie Knope,Get up here.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to speak for Jerry.
Leslie Knope,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.
Jerry Gergich,Correct.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,What about this?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Jerry Gergich,This is real.
Jerry Gergich,I really dislocated my shoulder.
Leslie Knope,Were you even in the park yesterday?
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito."
Leslie Knope,The farting.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"And Lord Sheldon, he lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek."
Jerry Gergich,"So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird."
Leslie Knope,"Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?"
Jerry Gergich,Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife?"
Andy Dwyer,Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Hey! Ann Perkins, in the ""shoe-shouse."""
Ann Perkins,I wanted to check in.
Ann Perkins,I brought some stuff from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,"Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those."
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you know, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,"But really, I'm feeling great."
Andy Dwyer,I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night.
Andy Dwyer,And-- Hold on a second.
Andy Dwyer,Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,What the hell? I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating.
April Ludgate,Score.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It tastes like a rug.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,Don't hit me.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're feeling better."
Andy Dwyer,I am.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.
Andy Dwyer,That's so cool.
Ann Perkins,"Since when did he start doing stuff for other people? Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain."
Ann Perkins,"People change, I guess."
Mark Brendanawicz,Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses."
Mark Brendanawicz,I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.
Leslie Knope,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers."
Leslie Knope,Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Carl.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner,"Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor."
Leslie Knope,"Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice."
Carl Lorthner,A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting.
Carl Lorthner,Take a peek at this.
Carl Lorthner,Keep your eyes on the creek.
Carl Lorthner,There he is.
Carl Lorthner,This is my favorite part.
Carl Lorthner,Not willing to share with a dog.
Carl Lorthner,"So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,I have a proposition for you.
Carl Lorthner,Fine.
Carl Lorthner,I'll have sex with you in exchange for the tape.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I am saying.
Leslie Knope,Okay? Just listen to what I have to say.
Joan Callamezzo,The Ramsett Park mugging story continues with a shiny new twist.
Joan Callamezzo,Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Now, I understand that you have a bombshell to drop that you are just sitting on."
Carl Lorthner,"Yes, that's correct."
Carl Lorthner,I came on today because I have some very important information to share.
Carl Lorthner,I finally saw Avatar and I thought it lived up to the hype.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, I'm not sure what that has to do with the mugging."
Joan Callamezzo,Uh... Leslie.
Joan Callamezzo,Counterpoint.
Leslie Knope,I disagree with Carl.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype."
Carl Lorthner,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, weâ¦"
Carl Lorthner,Disagreement.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, things are really heating up in here, aren't they? We should probably take some calls."
Joan Callamezzo,That segment was a disaster.
Joan Callamezzo,Don't you ever [bleep] me like that again.
Joan Callamezzo,This is Pawnee [bleep] Today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Do you know that I bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders for you? You disgust me, Knope."
Joan Callamezzo,Get out of my sight.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."
Joan Callamezzo,Go.
Joan Callamezzo,Go on.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, no, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,Don't make me chase you.
Joan Callamezzo,You want to go eat something?
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I am part of a great team.
Leslie Knope,"And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it."
Leslie Knope,"This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it."
Leslie Knope,Right after I watch it one more time.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but it is so good."
