Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,It's your job.
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should have to interview just like everyone else."
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years."
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,I was your boss.
Ron Swanson,I also walked you down the aisle at your wedding.
Ron Swanson,Take the job and leave me alone.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Just interview me.
Leslie Knope,No special treatment.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, fine."
Ron Swanson,What do you believe should be the ultimate goal of this department?
Leslie Knope,"The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life"
Leslie Knope,What are you writing?
Leslie Knope,Is it good?
Ron Swanson,What do you think is the best use of our yearly budget?
Leslie Knope,It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, the correct answer is ""Give it all back to the taxpayers."""
Ron Swanson,It seems you and I have fundamentally different philosophies.
Ron Swanson,"Frankly, it's a miracle we ever worked together without killing each other."
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Leslie Knope,"Ha, ha, okay."
Leslie Knope,No more goofing around.
Leslie Knope,Just tell me I have the job.
Ron Swanson,I have a lot of other people to meet with.
Ron Swanson,I'll be in touch.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on, it's me."
Leslie Knope,Give me special treatment.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, it shows everyone's spirit dogs."
Tom Haverford,That one's you.
Leslie Knope,You guys think I'm a border collie?
Leslie Knope,So obviously a cocker spaniel.
April Ludgate,The spirit dog committee ruled on that weeks ago.
April Ludgate,There is no appeals process.
Donna Meagle,No.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,I'm in on the joke.
Leslie Knope,"I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working."
Donna Meagle,Classic border collie.
Donna Meagle,Has to control everything.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Tom Haverford,"First on the agenda: I'm gonna bring my lemonade stand idea to the small business coalition, and a little birdie told me it's already in the bag."
Tom Haverford,Can I get a what what?
Ron Swanson,What?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What idea?
Ron Swanson,"The fella who runs the hot stew stand in Lafayette Park is retiring, so Pawnee's new business liaison-- Tom-- went out and got the Indiana Brothers juice company to rent it out as a lemonade stand."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I downloaded this dope app that pops champagne whenever I say something awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that's great."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,And it was only 9 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"No, I mean, the lemonade... never mind."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research."
Tom Haverford,"Don't sweat it, Lezkno."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's taking care of every last detail.
Leslie Knope,Nothing I can do to help?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I can straighten this for you.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Larry."
Chris Traeger,We've been taking pictures all over City Hall to show our unborn baby where we met.
Chris Traeger,Would you mind?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich,I would be honored.
Jerry Gergich,"Say, when are you crazy kids gonna get hitched?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, you know, actually, we haven't discussed it in a while."
Chris Traeger,"No, it's kind of taken a back seat."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, you know, to each his own, but you guys really seem like you're in love."
Jerry Gergich,"And when I see a couple who look at each other the way you do, I don't know, it just makes me think that maybe this crazy world is gonna be okay."
Chris Traeger,That literally went on forever.
Chris Traeger,I thought you were never gonna stop talking.
Chris Traeger,"But now that you have, Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Cracker dust.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, I mean, yes, of of course, let's do it."
Jerry Gergich,"Can I have a sip of your water, please?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,I'mI'm a bit of a germaphobe.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, no, no, totally understand."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna cough it out.
Chris Traeger,I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.
Chris Traeger,I love you.
Ann Perkins,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,No part of this is how I pictured it.
Jerry Gergich,"I thought another cracker might push it through, but I was wrong."
Chris Traeger,Let's do this right.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Let's go get an engagement ring.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,That was a beautiful moment.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, France!"
Andy Dwyer,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,You guys enjoying that cheese?
Ben Wyatt,It's unpasteurized.
Andy Dwyer,What's that mean?
Ben Wyatt,Unpasteurized?
Andy Dwyer,I don't care.
Andy Dwyer,I don't care.
Ben Wyatt,"Technically, it's illegal in this country."
Ben Wyatt,I smuggled it back from Paris.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, I want you guys to think of my office as a clubhouse, total open door policy."
Ben Wyatt,I wanna be your friend as well as your boss.
April Ludgate,What the hell is wrong with you?
April Ludgate,Are you in a cult?
April Ludgate,Can I join?
April Ludgate,Let's sacrifice Larry.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, April."
Ben Wyatt,"It's my first day as city manager, so I'm holding open office hours to break the ice."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, Chris was always the nice guy that made everyone happy, while I brought down the hammer."
Ben Wyatt,"But now that he's gone, I kind of have to do both."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone is the best.
Ben Wyatt,We're cutting vacation time.
Ben Wyatt,Let's eat vitamins.
Ben Wyatt,This is exhausting.
Ben Wyatt,Listen real quick.
Ben Wyatt,I have some super cool new rules
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, nice."
Ben Wyatt,That are also super mandatory.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?"
Donna Meagle,Are you serious?
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Massive time waster.
Ben Wyatt,Kills productivity.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, let's talk health insurance."
Ben Wyatt,Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Ben Wyatt,Have some illegal cheese.
April Ludgate,No cell phone usage on City Hall property?
April Ludgate,"That's not fair, my cell phone is how I avoid doing work."
Andy Dwyer,Bathroom breaks should be limited to five minutes?
Andy Dwyer,I can't shower in five minutes.
Donna Meagle,"See, he's acting all looseygoosey, but that little dude's wound so tight, he's gonna pop."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation, sanitation in the house tonight"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, what happened to our spirit dogs?"
Leslie Knope,I came up with a way better game.
Leslie Knope,Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are a blue flyer."
Leslie Knope,So am I.
Leslie Knope,So are you and Donna.
Leslie Knope,And look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,Look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,I mean Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer?
Leslie Knope,There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, hell of a game, right, guys?"
Leslie Knope,"Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, once you got on the city council, we kinda stopped doin' that."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System."
Leslie Knope,It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
Leslie Knope,It is my very soul.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I have my own system."
Tom Haverford,Step one: Chill out a bit.
Tom Haverford,Step two: Get up there and rip it.
Leslie Knope,That's your plan?
Leslie Knope,To-- to rip it?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Tom's project."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you should let him do things his way.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's better than going with a tried and true 80 step system that led to and I quote ""The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, overprepared presentation that we've seen."""
Leslie Knope,"And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I'll go back to your system."
Tom Haverford,You're the big dog around here.
Leslie Knope,Big kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,And thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house."
Leslie Knope,"I invented this parks game, son."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,When did they put a lamp here?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,The boys in blue?
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, what can I do for you for?"
Extra,We got a tip about some food entering the country illegally.
Ben Wyatt,"No no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"This-- it's just cheese, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, I got it in France."
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Did you declare it on your customs form when you reentered the country?
Extra,We're gonna need you to come down to the station.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure that's not necessary.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just this is really good cheese.
Ben Wyatt,You should try some.
Extra,Are you trying to bribe us?
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I surrender.
Extra,Step forward.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Extra,There you go.
Chris Traeger,This is so exciting.
Theodore,"Hi, folks."
Theodore,When's the big day?
Theodore,"I assume this is a, you know"
Chris Traeger,Oh. No.
Chris Traeger,"This isn't a shotgun wedding, although, yes, she is pregnant, and, yes, we did just decide to get married today."
Ann Perkins,"We haven't told our families or chosen a venue, but it's not a shotgun wedding."
Extra,We've been planning ours for months.
Extra,You wouldn't believe how much there is to do.
Extra,"Invitations, table settings, color scheme, dance lessons."
Extra,And that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Extra,"Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner."
Ann Perkins,That sounds elaborate.
Ann Perkins,"All we did was punch ""jewelry store"" into our car GPS."
Ann Perkins,"You remember that romantic moment, Chris?"
Chris Traeger,I was getting gas.
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't remember it."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed."
Leslie Knope,Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, flipped through it."
Tom Haverford,Looks good.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,You're lying.
Leslie Knope,"I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken."
Ron Swanson,Whose hair is that?
Ron Swanson,It's brown.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation."
Tom Haverford,Au contraire.
Tom Haverford,I'm working on it right now.
Tom Haverford,And what's the most important part of a presentation?
Leslie Knope,Content.
Tom Haverford,The presentation.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you need hard data."
Leslie Knope,You need facts to make your case.
Leslie Knope,And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
Leslie Knope,"You know, a classic ha ha hmm."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay?"
Tom Haverford,I got this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine, I trust you."
Leslie Knope,"But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb."
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"Nothing, good luck."
Ron Swanson,This is an elk hair.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It's the most effective hair for binder security.
Leslie Knope,"You know that, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department."
Leslie Knope,I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen."
Extra,"We've got a couple of customs agents coming down from the border, and they are not happy."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe this.
Ben Wyatt,I never break the law.
Ben Wyatt,I've never even jaywalked.
Extra,Never?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, everyone does it sometimes."
Extra,Just add that to the charges.
Extra,"Well, well, well, we got a hit on your prints."
Extra,Seems you're wanted for tax fraud in Colorado?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I've never even been to Colorado.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I had a layover in Denver once."
Extra,"Man, you can't keep your story straight, can you?"
Ben Wyatt,Come on!
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Here comes the customs guys now.
Extra,"Fellas, he's all yours."
Donna Meagle,You're pranked.
Andy Dwyer,You gotta see the stupid look on your face.
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,I took a picture.
Andy Dwyer,Classic!
Donna Meagle,You seemed a little uptight.
Donna Meagle,Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,This-- you got me.
Ben Wyatt,"Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison"
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, that's super funny, you scamps."
Leslie Knope,"Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,"Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do."
Stu,I don't know.
Stu,"I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies."
Stu,I was thinking about getting into bisques.
Leslie Knope,"Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years."
Leslie Knope,Retirement is for the birds.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna be so bored.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Leslie Knope,Screw bisque.
Stu,That makes a lot of sense.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Stu,What now?
Stu,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about."
Leslie Knope,I'll take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Stu,"Thanks, Leslie."
Stu,This calls for a toast.
Stu,Susan?
Stu,"Stew flutes, please."
Stu,Ah.
Leslie Knope,To stew.
Stu,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's very hot.
Stu,Mmhmm.
Theodore,Congratulations.
Theodore,This is a beauty.
Theodore,"If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band."
Ann Perkins,"That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet."
Chris Traeger,"We could engrave ""2014"" or ""TBD."""
Ann Perkins,Hang on.
Ann Perkins,"If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason."
Chris Traeger,"When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people."
Ann Perkins,Right?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're having a child together."
Ann Perkins,We're moving to a new city.
Ann Perkins,You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.
Chris Traeger,That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a neverending roller coaster of emotion.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other?"
Extra,That is so beautiful.
Chris Traeger,"Theodore, we would like to return that ring."
Chris Traeger,"And get a refund, please."
Extra,Maybe we should talk this over too.
Theodore,"Oh, come on."
Extra,Think what we could do if we didn't buy this ring.
Extra,"I mean, this could go towards buying a house."
Chris Traeger,You have a lovely store.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, boss?"
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"I was just printing out my minesweeper high score, and I noticed this memo."
Andy Dwyer,You're punishing us for the prank?
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's just like a warning memo.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Hey, all in good fun, but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended."""
Ben Wyatt,That kind of thing.
Andy Dwyer,Listen.
Andy Dwyer,"I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,I feel like you're blowing it.
Andy Dwyer,"If you want people to like you, you have to play along."
Andy Dwyer,Don't punish Donna and April.
Andy Dwyer,Prank them back.
Ben Wyatt,"I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I could help you."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I once did the best prank of all time.
Andy Dwyer,I dumped all of my boss's action figures into a fish tank.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that was me."
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't really like it.
Andy Dwyer,Classic.
Leslie Knope,"Great news, guys."
Leslie Knope,I just saved your bacon.
Ron Swanson,Impossible.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know where it is.
Leslie Knope,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement."
Leslie Knope,So pressure's off.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I spent a lot of time on this.
Leslie Knope,"Doin' what, putting mousse in your hair?"
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based serum.
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, who uses mousse still?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Let's put our differences aside for a second.
Tom Haverford,"Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I use the juicy space thing-- whatever you do."
Leslie Knope,"The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Stu's sales are flat.
Tom Haverford,Lemonade's the future.
Tom Haverford,I'm still doing my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I didn't think so.
Chris Traeger,"On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me ""Mr. Perkins."""
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that makes me feel weird too."
Ann Perkins,Maybe we should.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know anymore."""
Chris Traeger,"""Maybe we should."""
Chris Traeger,"""I don't know anymore."""
Chris Traeger,"Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment."
Theodore,"Okay, you're all set."
Theodore,Credit card's been fully refunded.
Chris Traeger,Perfect timing.
Chris Traeger,We are going to buy this ring.
Chris Traeger,Charge it.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Ann Perkins,I don't know!
Chris Traeger,Me either!
Chris Traeger,Maybe let's not?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think maybe not."
Theodore,Okay.
Theodore,Ring's yours again.
Theodore,Hello?
Chris Traeger,"Actually, we don't want the ring."
Theodore,Unbelievable.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, look."
Ron Swanson,"I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up."
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?
Leslie Knope,The botched laser show?
Leslie Knope,Larry still can't see purple.
Ron Swanson,That was Larry's fault.
Ron Swanson,He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash and no substance."
Ron Swanson,That's the old Tom.
Ron Swanson,"You've been gone for a while, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Tom has changed.
Ron Swanson,"He ran a business, sold it for a profit."
Ron Swanson,"He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you."
Ron Swanson,"At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job."
Andy Dwyer,You guys.
Andy Dwyer,You guys.
Andy Dwyer,Be cool.
April Ludgate,What's going on?
Andy Dwyer,"I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand."
Andy Dwyer,"I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now."
Andy Dwyer,Here he is.
Andy Dwyer,Just be cool.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,"Um, oh, I just remembered."
Ben Wyatt,Can I show you something out to the front area?
Ben Wyatt,And leave your cell phones because of no reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go to the parking lot now."
April Ludgate,"Wow, this is really sad."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, follow to me, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, can't go through with this."
Ben Wyatt,I was gonna pull a prank.
April Ludgate,No!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero."
Ben Wyatt,"They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, ""Hey, you get pranked much?"""
Donna Meagle,What the [bleep]?
Ben Wyatt,"I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word."
Andy Dwyer,And that's when I would push this button.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,You got blood all over me.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,I mean it.
April Ludgate,"Ben, that was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
April Ludgate,Best prank ever.
Theodore,"I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how old is your son?"
Theodore,Just pick a thing.
Ann Perkins,"Honey, look at this."
Ann Perkins,This is what I want.
Ann Perkins,I don't want a ring.
Ann Perkins,I don't want a wedding.
Ann Perkins,I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we've never been traditional."
Ann Perkins,We made out the first night we ever met.
Chris Traeger,"And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now."
Chris Traeger,"And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love."
Chris Traeger,"We've never been very conventional, so why start now?"
Chris Traeger,"Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket."
Chris Traeger,How much?
Theodore,Just take it and get outta here.
Chris Traeger,Thank you!
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Extra,We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.
Extra,"Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction."
Extra,Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, it's because of Stu."
Leslie Knope,"Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel."
Leslie Knope,"And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat."""
Leslie Knope,"Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that."
Leslie Knope,Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make it five years.
Leslie Knope,"Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
Stu,I think I've made a terrible mistake.
Extra,"Okay, that was bleak."
Extra,"Uh. Mr. Haverford, you have a presentation as well?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Rip it.
Tom Haverford,There's nothing more American than lemonade.
Tom Haverford,Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.
Tom Haverford,And now you can.
Tom Haverford,Check under your seats.
Extra,"Heh, hey."
Extra,Has my name on it.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it does."
Tom Haverford,"Classic for you, Carter."
Tom Haverford,"Darva, yours is a pink lemonade."
Tom Haverford,I know you love that.
Extra,Because I like pink.
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"Now, who here likes laser shows?"
Tom Haverford,Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.
Tom Haverford,The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.
Tom Haverford,My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But-- you know, I want you to like me."
Ben Wyatt,But I- I also really need you to respect me.
Andy Dwyer,"I respect you, little buddy."
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,"Mm, respect noogie."
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Donna Meagle,We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.
Donna Meagle,We did it 'cause we love you.
Andy Dwyer,R e s p e g c
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled."
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled."
Extra,"Hey, Wyatt."
Extra,You were a good sport earlier.
Extra,No hard feelings?
Tom Haverford,Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based hair serum.
Tom Haverford,"Enough with the mousse, for real."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you were right."
Leslie Knope,Tom has really grown up.
Ron Swanson,You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom's come into his own."
Leslie Knope,April runs Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, does this department even need me anymore?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We do not.
Ron Swanson,April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.
Ron Swanson,It's why I hired them.
Ron Swanson,Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.
Ron Swanson,This office can indeed function without you.
Ron Swanson,"And soon, it'll have to."
Leslie Knope,Was that a death threat?
Ron Swanson,We both know you're not gonna be here forever.
Ron Swanson,This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.
Ron Swanson,"Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency."
