Andrew Luck,"We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!"
Jim Irsay,Who is ready to play 60?
Leslie Knope,Everybody on the field!
All,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.
Leslie Knope,"And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Reggie!"
Leslie Knope,I told you to run a button hook.
Reggie Wayne,"I did, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I guess you would know.
Ron Swanson,"A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Luck."
Ron Swanson,We met briefly last year at our friend's bachelor party.
Andrew Luck,"Oh, yeah."
Andrew Luck,Right.
Andrew Luck,How are you?
Ron Swanson,"I normally don't answer that question, but since I respect your talent, I will tell you I am fine."
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm April."
April Ludgate,I stole your wallet.
Andrew Luck,You guys are weird.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Robert Mathis,"What's up, girl?"
Donna Meagle,"Keep walking, 98."
Ben Wyatt,You don't even want to talk to that guy?
Ben Wyatt,He plays for the NFL.
Donna Meagle,He's a linebacker.
Donna Meagle,Skill positions only for Donna Meagle.
Tom Haverford,"I got my Colts beanie, my Colts scarf, I got the Colts grill going, and the crowning glory Colts slippies."
Adam Vinatieri,How are you going to run in those?
Tom Haverford,"""Run""?"
Tom Haverford,Tommy doesn't run.
Tom Haverford,That's your guys' job.
Tom Haverford,"Now, uh, let's go fetch this football throw, fellas."
Tom Haverford,I love sports.
Leslie Knope,"Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it stunning?
Tom Haverford,It's just a big dumb pond.
Tom Haverford,This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.
Tom Haverford,"So my bar for ""stunning"" is pretty high."
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?
Tom Haverford,Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, send me a link to that video."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history."
Leslie Knope,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.
Leslie Knope,But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.
Leslie Knope,Lame duck?
Leslie Knope,Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.
Tom Haverford,It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that RentaSwag's closed.
Tom Haverford,I'm a businessman.
Tom Haverford,That's what I was born to do.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have."
Leslie Knope,"Like, take that trash collector."
Leslie Knope,"It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,He's not wearing any pants.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with him?
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Leslie Knope,He's smiling at us!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,Run!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what's up guys?"
Jerry Gergich,Look what Ron made.
Jerry Gergich,It's amazing.
Ron Swanson,"Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree."
Ron Swanson,"I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child."
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib."
Chris Traeger,You're ignoring every known crib safety standard.
Chris Traeger,It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.
Chris Traeger,Are you going to crawl my way?
Chris Traeger,By Lenny Kravitz.
Ron Swanson,My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.
Chris Traeger,"I bought my crib in Bloomington, and I am confident that it is literally the safest crib in the explored universe."
Chris Traeger,"Let me take you there, and you can talk to the salesperson."
Ron Swanson,"Counteroffer you take me nowhere, and I talk to no one."
Chris Traeger,"Counter-counteroffer you come with me, or I make you attend a four hour fax cover sheet protocol meeting."
Chris Traeger,"Either way, it's a win for me."
Leslie Knope,Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee Eagleton reservoir merger.
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, come on."
Jeremy Jamm,Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?
Councilman Milton,Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Councilman Dexhart,Fluoride can control minds?
Councilman Dexhart,"Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?"
Leslie Knope,How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ah, all right."
Jeremy Jamm,You got me.
Jeremy Jamm,"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that is not a valid reason."
Jeremy Jamm,"Pawnee's cavity problem is why a small town dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride."
Jeremy Jamm,Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.
Leslie Knope,Why did we come out here?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Fluoride in the water it's a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,Can't you just let me have this one?
Jeremy Jamm,"No can do, Knopey."
Jeremy Jamm,"As a matter of fact, I would like to propose my own bill the Pawnee Clean Water Bill, which prohibits adding anything to our water supply forever."
Leslie Knope,"Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?"
Leslie Knope,"On my side, I have facts, science, and reason."
Leslie Knope,All he has is fearmongering.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, he's gonna win."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, people get jittery about stuff like this."
Ben Wyatt,Remember last year when no one would get flu shots 'cause there was a rumor they turned you European?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'll figure something out."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Jessica's here."
Ben Wyatt,I better go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Jessica Wicks,"Hey, sugar butt."
Jessica Wicks,"Some lardos in Muncie ate tainted Sweetums toffee sticks and diarrhea'd so much, they ended up in the hospital."
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Jessica Wicks,"Can we give their school, like, a new seesaw or something?"
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,Thanks.
Donna Meagle,The new site looks good.
Donna Meagle,Nice work.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, my God."
Craig Middlebrooks,These dogs are so cute.
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to throw up and kill myself.
April Ludgate,Animal control had to take in all the pets from Eagleton.
April Ludgate,"And Crazy Craig used to run all their shelters, so he helped me make an adoption website for all the dogs."
April Ludgate,If you can look at that site and not want to take home you're basically a war criminal.
April Ludgate,See the way that dog is rolling around in a puddle?
April Ludgate,That's something Andy does when he gets hot.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, you're right."
Donna Meagle,That is so Andy.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,That dog is totally Tom!
Donna Meagle,I don't know why.
Donna Meagle,It doesn't look like him.
Donna Meagle,But it just is.
Donna Meagle,It's like the dog is the essence of Tom.
April Ludgate,"Okay, important meeting in the conference room right now."
April Ludgate,We are going to all pick our spirit dogs.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle at the airport."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Larry, I swear to God, if you leave right now, we will make your spirit dog a miniature schnauzer."
Jerry Gergich,Is that bad?
Craig Middlebrooks,Yes!
Craig Middlebrooks,Get in there!
Chris Traeger,Ann found this place.
Chris Traeger,"It's where we bought our ""Sounds of Nature"" machine."
Ron Swanson,You bought a machine that replicates an open window?
Chris Traeger,Frasier!
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Do you remember me?
Chris Traeger,"I came in here looking for the Vanna White book on child care, I'd like to solve the puzzle of parenting."
Chris Traeger,"Could you show my friend, Ron, that amazing crib that you sold me?"
Chris Traeger,The Babylove L'il Sweetheart Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.
Extra,"Oh, yeah, that thing is a deathtrap."
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry?
Extra,Just found out this morning it's being recalled.
Extra,They found maxicylofentabol in the glue.
Chris Traeger,Is that good?
Chris Traeger,It sounds bad.
Extra,It burned off my fingernails.
Ron Swanson,I'll be in the car.
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilwoman Leslie Knope wants to put fluoride, which is a chemical, into your drinking water."
Jeremy Jamm,You know what else is a chemical?
Jeremy Jamm,Strychnine and cyanide.
Leslie Knope,What?
Perd Hapley,And dirt and rust and even broken glass.
Jeremy Jamm,Exactly.
Jeremy Jamm,"You definitely understand what chemicals are, Perd."
Jeremy Jamm,"I would suggest if you want to contact the psychopath that wants to turn your kids into bad at math, communist fluoride zombies, well, just call the number at the bottom of your screen."
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Stop right there.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,You just talked to that person like I talk to you.
Tom Haverford,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,"What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?"
Leslie Knope,Why did it take me so long to realize this?
Leslie Knope,There are no consequences to my actions anymore.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm like a white, male U.S. senator."
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride is going into the water, moron."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, mom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Because all it does is prevent cavities!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,I expected more from you.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'm a loose cannon.
Leslie Knope,We need to fight fire with fire.
Leslie Knope,"I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!"
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,Too extreme?
Tom Haverford,Too nothing.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm's already ruined fluoride."
Tom Haverford,Everyone's scared of it.
Tom Haverford,What if we just called it something else?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,I mean we rebrand.
Tom Haverford,No one cared about Calvin Broadus until he started calling himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.
Tom Haverford,"Then when people got tired of that, he went by Snoop Dogg, and now he's Snoop Lion."
Tom Haverford,What's he gonna be in ten years? Snoop Laser Snake?
Tom Haverford,Who knows?
Leslie Knope,What are you saying we need to sex up fluoride?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's a pretty sexy topic already.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you got to give people something to get excited about."
Tom Haverford,You told me to make the most of my job.
Tom Haverford,I'm good at this stuff.
Tom Haverford,"Now, are you a loose cannon or not?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm as loose as a goose.
Leslie Knope,"Do your thing, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Aw.
Donna Meagle,"Now, remember, it's about finding a dog that captures your spirit."
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,This is Craig.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, no!"
Craig Middlebrooks,That is insane!
Craig Middlebrooks,I will burn this place to the ground if you pick that one!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, good choice."
April Ludgate,"You guys, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Yes!
Jerry Gergich,And Ron Swanson.
Craig Middlebrooks,Oh!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,This is Larry.
Jerry Gergich,That's great.
April Ludgate,Bingo.
April Ludgate,Donna.
April Ludgate,Nailed it.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
April Ludgate,Because you're pretty and you like makeup and stuff.
Donna Meagle,Game over.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way."
Ron Swanson,Wonderful.
Ron Swanson,First rule no conversation lasts longer than 100 total words.
Ron Swanson,You have used 9.
Ron Swanson,I have used 20.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Chris Traeger,Fun.
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to teach me to build a crib.
Ron Swanson,Why do you need to build your own crib?
Chris Traeger,Because I no longer trust anything other than my own two hands.
Chris Traeger,"It is debilitating, but exciting."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, we'll go to my woodshop at lunch."
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,Look at us both standing on the cusp of fatherhood.
Chris Traeger,"I know we haven't spent a lot of time together, but"
Ron Swanson,100
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, so, in conclusion fluoride, chemical, tiny genitals, misinformation, panic, death, Jenny McCarthy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, councilman."
Leslie Knope,That was a little dry.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we have some fun, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Check this.
Kyle,Plain water?
Kyle,Yuck.
Kyle,I'm bored.
Tom Haverford,Then try this.
Kyle,What the what just happened?
Tom Haverford,"That water contains teeth dazzler, which makes your teeth stronger and starts a party in your mouth."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride's boring, guys."
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Tdazzle.
Leslie Knope,It's not a chemical.
Leslie Knope,It's an aquatic based social media oral experience.
Tom Haverford,Everyone who tweets at T-Dazzle in the next hour will be entered to win an exciting plain blue Tshirt.
Tom Haverford,"I say ""T,"" you say ""dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for the woodworking lesson, Ron."
Chris Traeger,This whole crib recall thing has got me literally rethinking everything I thought I knew about parenting.
Chris Traeger,"What sleep method will you be using Ferber, Sears?"
Ron Swanson,"Swanson method, where you close your eyes and fall asleep."
Chris Traeger,"I really wish Ron would engage, but he exudes so much wisdom that I can learn parenting tips simply by being in his presence."
Chris Traeger,Someone like Ron is teaching even when they're not teaching.
Chris Traeger,Does that make sense?
Chris Traeger,My anxiety has kept me up for over 50 hours.
Leslie Knope,"Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding Tdazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's so-called Clean Water Bill."
Leslie Knope,"Eat it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I won.
Jeremy Jamm,Apology accepted.
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, I've actually come around to your way of thinking on this."
Jeremy Jamm,"My only thought is, why stop here?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ladies and gentlemen, Sweetums president Jessica Wicks."
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jessica Wicks,"Look, we all love T-Dazzle."
Jessica Wicks,But we can do more to improve our drinking supply.
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums is excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water.
Jessica Wicks,"We call it ""Drinkems""!"
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jeremy Jamm,Sweetums is prepared to take over the management of Pawnee's water.
Jeremy Jamm,This is gonna save this town beaucoup bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,Take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it coming out of your faucets at home.
Leslie Knope,This water is filled with sugar.
Leslie Knope,There's absolutely no way we are doing this.
Jeremy Jamm,Too late. We're going to fill the whole reservoir with this stuff.
Jeremy Jamm,Checkmate.
Leslie Knope,Did you bring those with you just to do that?
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Tom Haverford,It is a baller move.
Tom Haverford,"What are we gonna do now, Leslie?"
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Okay, are you still mad at me about the poodle thing?"
April Ludgate,It was just a dumb game.
April Ludgate,I can pick another dog.
Donna Meagle,I'm not mad about the choice.
Donna Meagle,I'm mad about your reasons.
Donna Meagle,"""Pretty,"" ""makeup"" is that all you know about me?"
April Ludgate,We don't hang out that much.
April Ludgate,It's not like you know a ton about me.
Donna Meagle,"You're beautiful, yet cold and aloof."
Donna Meagle,You pride yourself on being a loner.
Donna Meagle,"You do not obey, you choose to cooperate."
Donna Meagle,"And when you stop baring your fangs to pick a mate, it's for life."
Donna Meagle,"And you're fiercely loyal to your pack, which makes you a rare black Siberian husky."
Craig Middlebrooks,"That was so spot on, it was scary."
Craig Middlebrooks,I need to go lie down for 45 minutes.
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, an hour. A full hour."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,This won't take long.
Leslie Knope,"Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar."
Leslie Knope,What's next cookie dough toothpaste?
Leslie Knope,Bad example.
Leslie Knope,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,"My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profit hungry corporation that is ruining our health."
Leslie Knope,"Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%."
Leslie Knope,It's unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Down with that poison peddling corporate monster.
Leslie Knope,Down with Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Heard about your speech.
Ben Wyatt,Sounded great.
Leslie Knope,I wish you could've seen it.
Leslie Knope,It felt so good.
Leslie Knope,I love loose cannoning.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love the power of no consequences."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, unfortunately, there has been one consequence."
Ben Wyatt,I just got fired from Sweetums.
Leslie Knope,Because you were embezzling I hope.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jessica!"
Leslie Knope,Did you do something to your hair?
Leslie Knope,"Because, sister, you look good enough to eat."
Leslie Knope,Num num num num num.
Jessica Wicks,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,You can't punish Ben for something I did.
Leslie Knope,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back."
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Jessica Wicks,I want you to formally apologize for what you said about Sweetums.
Jessica Wicks,"I want you to say that we're a moral, upstanding corporation that you're proud to have in Pawnee."
Jessica Wicks,"And when you make your apology, I want you to wear a limegreen pantsuit because it will look horrible on you."
Jessica Wicks,You are such an autumn.
Donna Meagle,Did you need me for something?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to figure out your spirit dog, and I'm going to do that by learning everything there is to know about you."
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Game on.
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's your favorite color?"
Donna Meagle,"For cars, it's gold."
Donna Meagle,"For shoes, it's red unless it's the weekend, then reverse them."
April Ludgate,Favorite music?
Donna Meagle,"1970s funk and 1770s opera and Sugar Ray, post Mark McGrath after he left for Entertainment Tonight."
April Ludgate,Favorite book?
Donna Meagle,Downton Abbey.
April Ludgate,That's not a
Donna Meagle,Downtonâ¦ Abbey.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Um, describe your perfect Sunday."
Donna Meagle,"Church, do the Harper's Magazine Acrostic, play my oboe in the jacuzzi while the sun sets over puget sound."
April Ludgate,Favorite movies?
Donna Meagle,"In order Natural Born Killers, Remains of the Day, and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."
April Ludgate,Excellent.
April Ludgate,Thank you very much for your time.
April Ludgate,I will have your answer shortly.
April Ludgate,No idea.
Ron Swanson,"If a joint is properly fashioned, all you need to do is guide it into place."
Chris Traeger,"""All you need to do is guide it into place."""
Chris Traeger,"What I get from that is, when parenting, sometimes a subtle hand is more effective than a strong one."
Chris Traeger,This is already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting I read: Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno and Shaun White.
Ron Swanson,Nah.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, why did you throw that wood away?"
Ron Swanson,It's unstable.
Ron Swanson,It's no good.
Chris Traeger,"I just don't understand ""the throwing away the wood"" metaphor."
Chris Traeger,What's the lesson?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know!"
Chris Traeger,It's potty training.
Chris Traeger,"That trash can is the toilet, and the wood was the feces."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I'm not teaching you anything."
Ron Swanson,We're just building a crib.
Chris Traeger,"No, I know you're not consciously teaching me anything."
Chris Traeger,"I'm trying to siphon off some of your calm, centered wisdom through metaphors."
Ron Swanson,Metaphors? I hate metaphors.
Ron Swanson,"That's why my favorite book is Moby Dick-- no froufrou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal."
Ron Swanson,"That's enough for today, I think."
Chris Traeger,- An organized child is a--
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I've been working on this for three hours, and I know your spirit dog."
April Ludgate,"You are a Nova Scotia toller, because you're outgoing and adventurous."
April Ludgate,"And you love Canada? No, that's not right."
Donna Meagle,"No, it isn't."
Donna Meagle,But I appreciate the effort.
Donna Meagle,We're good.
Donna Meagle,And don't beat yourself up.
Donna Meagle,You'll probably never guess what kind of dog I am.
April Ludgate,You're right.
April Ludgate,"I'll never guess what kind of dog you are, because you're not a dog."
April Ludgate,You're a cat.
April Ludgate,You're temperamental.
April Ludgate,"You're unpredictable, complex, and hard to read."
April Ludgate,You make people work before you let them in.
April Ludgate,"But if they put the time in and prove that they care, then you open yourself up to them."
April Ludgate,"Right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"""So let's all raise a glass, full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution."""
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, don't do this."
Leslie Knope,"I have to, Ben."
Leslie Knope,We can't both be out of a job.
Leslie Knope,"What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies?"
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds horrible."
Ben Wyatt,There's more at stake here.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, if you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan."
Leslie Knope,"I know that, but--"
Ben Wyatt,And everything you said about Sweetums was right on.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused."
Ben Wyatt,And I don't want to work for them anymore.
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, just go up there, stick to your guns."
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna make a difference.
Leslie Knope,I can't beat them.
Leslie Knope,"All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Go get Tom.
Leslie Knope,Run! Get Tom!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.
Leslie Knope,"But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune."
Leslie Knope,Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement.
Leslie Knope,MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass?"
Leslie Knope,How does 136.086 grab you?
Leslie Knope,What the--
Tom Haverford,"I don't know about y'all, but Drink-ems seems pretty boring to me, not like H-2-flow."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.
Tom Haverford,"Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush."
Tom Haverford,Think of H-2-flow as an app for your teeth.
Tom Haverford,"The more flow you take in, the more sparkle points you get."
Tom Haverford,"Get enough sparkle points, and you're on your way to your first aqua badge!"
Tom Haverford,"Collect enough aqua badges, and we'll welcome you to the H-2-flow Platinum Club."
Tom Haverford,"I'm great at business, and I'm great at parks stuff."
Tom Haverford,I'm like Picasso meets Michael Jordan.
Tom Haverford,"I can paint, but, uh, I can also be a world-class gambler."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, what's this?"
Ron Swanson,The crib I built.
Ron Swanson,I'm giving it to you and Ann.
Ron Swanson,It's perfectly safe.
Ron Swanson,I tested it by hitting it with my truck.
Chris Traeger,"Well, Ron, I can't accept."
Chris Traeger,This is for your baby.
Ron Swanson,There's more than one crib tree in a forest.
Ron Swanson,"That's not a lesson, by the way, just a comment on lumber availability."
Chris Traeger,It's beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me."
Ron Swanson,And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make.
Ron Swanson,But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much.
Ron Swanson,That's all that matters.
Ron Swanson,You'll be a great father.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Ron for the crib and the advice."
Chris Traeger,It's much better than any metaphor.
Ron Swanson,Does the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence? No.
Ron Swanson,It's just a [bleep] fish.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, good news."
Leslie Knope,Drink-ems is dead.
Leslie Knope,"As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water."
Ben Wyatt,That's great news.
Ben Wyatt,"H-2-flow is fluoride, right?"
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,"I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Look at us.
Ben Wyatt,"Two people, who are about to have zero jobs."
Ben Wyatt,"Weird, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right?"
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh! Guess who won that plain blue T-shirt?
Ben Wyatt,No way! Look how blue it is.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Things are already looking up.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
