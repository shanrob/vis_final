Leslie Knope,"If I could sum up the Pawnee Commons in one word, it would be: Dynamite."
Leslie Knope,"""Dynamite"" stands for daring, youth friendly, natural, amazing, merry, inviting, tourist attractiony, and ecofriendly."
Extra,"Thank you, Councilwoman Knope very, very thorough and so many acronyms."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Extra,Councilman Jamm?
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, Bill."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, please, everyone be seated."
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show there was a standing ovation.
Leslie Knope,"No, there wasn't."
Ann Perkins,There was not.
Jeremy Jamm,History will decide.
Jeremy Jamm,My plan for lot 48 is simple.
Jeremy Jamm,But why read it when you can shove it right in your face?
Jeremy Jamm,I want to sell this lot to Paunch Burger.
Jeremy Jamm,Here's why.
Jeremy Jamm,We make money.
Jeremy Jamm,They make money.
Jeremy Jamm,They make burgers.
Jeremy Jamm,We eat burgers.
Extra,Mmhmm.
Jeremy Jamm,That's a win win win win.
Jeremy Jamm,Presentation over.
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm out.
Extra,"Oh, man."
Extra,Are there curly fries?
Extra,I love their curly fries.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the planning commission has a week to decide if they want a beautiful, innovative community park or a bunch of greasy lard bombs."
Leslie Knope,I'm not editorializing.
Leslie Knope,Paunch Burger's number one selling burger is the greasy lard bomb.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a hint as to which way you guys are leaning.
Extra,Off the record?
Extra,We're leaning towards Jamm.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,You know my plan is better for the community.
Extra,"Oh, it's way better, but you're also short 50,000 dollars."
Extra,We can't approve an underfunded project.
Extra,"Hey, get the rest of the money, you get your park."
Extra,You only have a week.
Leslie Knope,"What are we going to do, guys?"
Leslie Knope,How are we going to get that money?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Cheer up, little pups."
Tom Haverford,Registering for your wedding is the most important moment of your lives.
Tom Haverford,Love love fades away.
Tom Haverford,But things Things are forever.
Ben Wyatt,That's beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,Did the Dalai Lama say that?
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,A citrus reamer!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is the only way to ream citrus."
Tom Haverford,You're gonna need two of these.
Leslie Knope,I don't want a citrus reamer.
Leslie Knope,I don't want any of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I want is to be married to you and to somehow get 50,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,What if we register for the park instead of the stuff?
Ben Wyatt,We could organize a black tie gala with food and music and maybe a silent auction to raise money.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and people could donate, or they could bid to put their names on everything in the park, like benches, cobblestones, trees, ants, air."
Ben Wyatt,"Right, some of that is possible."
Leslie Knope,You are a genius.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,I'm really feeling these sheets very cozy.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say thank you for all your hard work this week.
Leslie Knope,Give yourselves a hand.
Leslie Knope,But your applause is premature.
Ann Perkins,You just told us to applaud.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?"
Ann Perkins,"I hope so, because the only way that this gala is going to happen is if you do everything I say."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need you to contact three more food vendors on this list, and they need to do it for free."
Tom Haverford,I'm omelet.
Tom Haverford,Get it?
Tom Haverford,"""I'm on it,"" ""I'm omelet""?"
Leslie Knope,"I get it, and I love it, but I don't have time for food puns right now."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm heading out."
Tom Haverford,Goodpie.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Tom Haverford,Gurt.
Tom Haverford,Gogurt.
Tom Haverford,I'm incredible.
Tom Haverford,See you guys.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, Jerry"
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, we need you back at the command center right now!"
Chris Traeger,We have a class one city emergency.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle.
Jerry Gergich,My girls!
Leslie Knope,What's the emergency?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, this is just a drill, but I am having so much fun pretending it's real."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,The disaster preparedness people picked today?
Leslie Knope,Each year every city in Indiana is reviewed by the Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee has failed On last year's report, they stated, ""Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, ""the town is in danger of collapsing into Thunderdome style, postapocalyptic mayhem."""
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we don't know how long Leslie's going to be gone, so let's just knock some of this stuff off."
Ann Perkins,Should someone stop Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,Gayle!
Donna Meagle,"Eh, he'll figure it out eventually."
Andy Dwyer,"First, we do the written exam, and then we do the personality evaluation, which I feel like I'm gonna nail, 'cause people always say, ""But he's got a great personality."""
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, quiz me."
April Ludgate,"Okay, what does it mean when an officer calls in a 3542?"
Andy Dwyer,Assault and battery.
Andy Dwyer,"The way I remember that, I picture 35 a salt shakers and 42 batteries."
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,What is the criminal code for arson?
Andy Dwyer,Arson is 533.
Andy Dwyer,You know how I remember that?
Andy Dwyer,I picture 533 salt shakers and batteries lighting a building on fire.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm nervous."
April Ludgate,"Babe, look at me."
April Ludgate,"You are going to pass this test, and you are going to become a cop."
April Ludgate,"And if you don't, I'll just divorce you and marry someone else and then cheat on them with you."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that's so sweet."
April Ludgate,"Also, I got you a lucky charm."
April Ludgate,"I found a dead rabbit on the side of the road, and I cut its feet off and made it into a lucky charm."
Andy Dwyer,"Baby, you are so creepy."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,I love it.
Extra,"Dwyer, you're up."
Leonard Tchulm,My name is Leonard Tchulm.
Leonard Tchulm,I'm head of the Indiana Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leonard Tchulm,And today I'm going to bring death and destruction to your town.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.
Leslie Knope,"And this year, we are more than prepared for your test, but, um, it just so happens, today is a little inconvenient."
Leonard Tchulm,"Good, because the best day for a drill is when it's inconvenient for everyone."
Leonard Tchulm,My mother is getting a colonoscopy today.
Leonard Tchulm,"I'm not even sure there's anyone there to drive her home, so we're all making sacrifices, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your mother."
Leonard Tchulm,"Mm, we're not that close."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leonard Tchulm,"Okay, volunteer victims, please put your identification placards on now and go to your designated areas throughout town."
Leonard Tchulm,"First Responders, return to your stations, and the simulation begins Went past the zero."
Leonard Tchulm,"I got to wait till it goes Okay, now."
Chris Traeger,"All right, officers, bolt the doors."
Chris Traeger,We are officially in lockdown mode.
Chris Traeger,The doors will not open until Leonard announces that this drill is complete.
Leslie Knope,"The most important event that I have ever organized in my entire life is happening in eight hours, and I am stuck in this room."
Leslie Knope,This is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Maybe this is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Nope, can't fly away."
Leslie Knope,This is real life.
Leonard Tchulm,"And now, I'm going to open one of these ten envelopes at random to determine your simulated disaster."
Leonard Tchulm,Pawnee has been hit by A strain of avian flu.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Avian flu!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"This is a simple one, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody open their binders, okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,"""The Knope Protocol""?"
Ann Perkins,"Uh, correction."
Ann Perkins,"That's ""Mission ImPawneeable: Knope Protocol."""
Leslie Knope,"Now, if everyone just follows my instructions, we will ace this test, and we will be done in 90 minutes."
Chris Traeger,"""Step one insert the DVD scenario."""
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, what could be on this?"
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, this is Channel 4 lead anchor Willow Tremaine, with breaking news."
Leslie Knope,Avian flu has just hit the town of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We go live now to St. Joseph's Medical Center for an update.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my name is Donatella Breckinridge, M.D."
Leslie Knope,"I graduated first in my class from Harvard Medical School, so I know what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"This is the avian flu, or we call ""H5N1."""
Ben Wyatt,"Donna, are we on schedule for the tent setup?"
Donna Meagle,"The tables showed up, which is good, but there are no chairs, which is bad."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, get some chairs from somewhere."
Donna Meagle,Great leadership inspiring.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was gonna go on Pawnee Today to promote the gala.
Ron Swanson,I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt,"No offense, Ron, but I don't think you'd be great on TV."
Ron Swanson,"I can speak in full sentences, and I won't cry."
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,I did cry last time.
Ben Wyatt,Godspeed.
Tom Haverford,Mmm!
Tom Haverford,"Smells amazing, Chef."
Tom Haverford,What you cooking?
Tom Haverford,Little coq au vin?
Tom Haverford,Little bouillabaisse?
Extra,"You can stop the asskissing, Haverford."
Extra,I know why you're here.
Extra,I cannot do the gala.
Extra,It doesn't make business sense to cater something that big for free.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,"If the gala doesn't go perfectly, the lot could become a Paunch Burger."
Tom Haverford,Doesn't that offend your refined Parisian sensibilities?
Extra,I'm from Orlando.
Extra,And I don't care about the Paunch Burger.
Extra,"If it was another French restaurant, maybe I'd worry."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Well, you know what?"
Extra,What?
Extra,What?
Extra,What you got for me?
Extra,Get out of my kitchen!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, okay."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, sorry, sorry."
Tom Haverford,Pardon!
Tom Haverford,Pardon!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Brett,Oh!
Brett,"Leslie, you on the TV!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're on mine, Brett."
Leslie Knope,We're having a video conference.
Brett,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with the avian flu.
Brett,Tight.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is bad news."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone there at Animal Control to eradicate all the infected birds in town.
Brett,"""Kill all birds."""
Brett,"This is for the drill, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Brett,But I'm actually gonna kill these birds for real?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just pretend."
Brett,Right.
Brett,"So how do I kill 'em like, with a gun?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Brett,I could fill up a bathtub and just drown 'em one at a time.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's forget we ever talked."
Brett,Got it.
Brett,Kill 'em.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, casualty update only four dead, two of whom were already gravely ill and brothers."
Chris Traeger,That family took a terrible hit.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's great news."
Leonard Tchulm,Not so fast.
Leonard Tchulm,I regret to inform you that someone in this room has begun exhibiting symptoms Christopher Traeger.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,"A few months ago, the thought of an infectious disease, even hypothetical, would have sent me careening towards Bummerville, but now I am infected with a killer virus, and I feel fine."
Chris Traeger,Therapy!
Leslie Knope,This is highly irregular.
Leslie Knope,We have followed protocol to the letter.
Leonard Tchulm,"No, you did not."
Leonard Tchulm,"Unfortunately, no one contacted the transit department to shut down bus service."
Leonard Tchulm,"So you rode a bus with a contagious man, and he infected you and 39 others."
Chris Traeger,That is impossible.
Chris Traeger,I do not ride the bus.
Chris Traeger,I ride my bicycle behind the bus as a windbreak.
Leonard Tchulm,Doesn't matter.
Leonard Tchulm,Prepare for the diarrhea.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who was supposed to deal with Transit?"
Jeremy Jamm,"My bad, guys."
Jeremy Jamm,That's my bad.
Jeremy Jamm,"Chris, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I should've had animal control kill you.
Brett,"Oh, who you want me to kill?"
Leslie Knope,No one.
Brett,I'll kill him As soon as I'm done with these birds.
Ron Swanson,Hello.

Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what you do."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me care
Leonard Tchulm,Attention.

Leslie Knope,"Fix it, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Fix it!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Donna Meagle,"I found one chair, got a lead on a second."
Ben Wyatt,Keep me posted.
Extra,So this test will determine whether you have the right personality profile to be a police officer.
Extra,"Just to make sure the machine is working, is your name Andy?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know how to answer that.
Extra,"A simple ""yes"" or ""no."""
Andy Dwyer,"Well, everyone calls me Andy, but my full name is Andrew, I think, so No?"
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Extra,Let's move on.
Extra,Scenario a high school aged child asks to hold your service revolver.
Extra,What do you do?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I give it to him."
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a kid, I always wanted to hold a cop's gun."
Andy Dwyer,"To make that dream come true for another kid Well, that's what being a cop is all about."
Extra,Scenario you pull a car over for speeding.
Extra,You find out that it's your father.
Extra,How do you handle the situation?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, first, I would be like, ""Dad You're alive?"""
Andy Dwyer,What the hell?
Andy Dwyer,"Also, do you know where my catcher's mitt is?"
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you be taking her to lie down somewhere?
Extra,"Oh, no."
Extra,"If she ever found out that we took her off camera, we'd all be fired."
Extra,"So just, uh, keep taking calls."
Extra,You're doing great.
Extra,"Three, two"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, again."
Ron Swanson,"I'm Ron Swanson, and I am still taking your calls hopefully, about tonight's gala."
Ron Swanson,You're on the air.
Extra,"Hi, uh, what's wrong with Joan?"
Ron Swanson,"She has a bad hangover, which she is pretending is allergies."
Extra,Is she gonna be okay?
Ron Swanson,Wouldn't know never been hungover.
Ron Swanson,"After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, panfried in salted butter."
Ron Swanson,"I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep."
Extra,That works?
Ron Swanson,It does.
Ron Swanson,"Please call now if you have questions about tonight's gala or one of my other interests Woodworking, uh, novels about tall ships, meat, that sort of thing."
Chris Traeger,I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Chris Traeger,"""I, Chris Traeger, after several sustained hours of diarrhea, combined with violent coughing and a devastating fever, followed by even more diarrhea, have succumbed to the avian flu."""
Chris Traeger,I'm dead.
Leslie Knope,"I got to say, Leonard, it kind of feels like you're putting us through the ringer here."
Leslie Knope,Can you us an idea how long this is gonna take?
Leonard Tchulm,Uh Probably six to eight more hours.
Leslie Knope,Eight more hours?
Leonard Tchulm,Nine.
Leslie Knope,Are all state emergency drills this intensive?
Leonard Tchulm,"Oh, no, hardly ever."
Leonard Tchulm,Councilman Jamm requested it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leonard Tchulm,Specifically asked that the drill to be done today and said I should give you everything I got.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Guys!
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,The game is rigged.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm invited Leonard here, and he screwed up the bus thing on purpose to slow us down."
Leslie Knope,"It is with a heavy heart that I say, ""We have been jammed."""
Ann Perkins,"God, that guy is the worst!"
Ann Perkins,"Look, we are stuck in this room until the drill is over."
Ann Perkins,What are we gonna do?
Leslie Knope,The only thing we can do.
Leslie Knope,In order to save our park We have to destroy the entire town.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are making some changes to the Knope Protocol."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, how much flu vaccine does the hospital still have?"
Ann Perkins,"Enough for 2,000 people."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you tell the hospital director to flush them down the toilet.
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Leslie Knope,"Chief Fugleberg, I want you to order your officers to find all the infected birds in the area and perform CPR."
Chief Fugleberg,Sorry.
Chief Fugleberg,Won't they become infected?
Leslie Knope,That's a risk we're gonna have to take.
Leslie Knope,Our top priority is now saving all the birds.
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just kick this up a notch?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with A tornado quake!
Ron Swanson,This is Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, caller."
Extra,Hi.
Extra,My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed up the legs on my kitchen table.
Extra,Is there a cheap way to repair that?
Ron Swanson,Great question.
Ron Swanson,Take a walnut and rub it into the legs of your table.
Ron Swanson,That'll mask the scratches.
Ron Swanson,Next thing you want to do is ditch the Terrier and get yourself a proper dog.
Ron Swanson,"Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless."
Ron Swanson,Come to the gala.
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,"Grapes of Wrath, chocolatechip ice cream, and Johnny Cash."
Ron Swanson,Don't trust big banks or small banks.
Ron Swanson,Banks are Ponzi schemes run by morons.
Ron Swanson,Your house isn't haunted.
Ron Swanson,You're lonely.
Ron Swanson,"Whatever happened to, ""Hey, I have some apples."""
Ron Swanson,Would you like to buy them?
Ron Swanson,"""Yes, thank you."""
Ron Swanson,That's as complicated as it should be to open a business in this country.
Ron Swanson,"I've seen three movies in my life Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and Herbie Fully Loaded."
Ron Swanson,My girlfriend's kids love it.
Ron Swanson,It's pretty funny.
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Chris Traeger,And it is a wrap.
Chris Traeger,Everyone in Pawnee is dead.
Chris Traeger,Including Councilman Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,What?
Jeremy Jamm,"No, no, you can't do that."
Ann Perkins,"It says right there, you're dead, so is everyone you care about."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, well, joke's on you."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't have anyone I care about.
Leonard Tchulm,"Ms. Knope, I'm afraid I have to once again give Pawnee a failing grade."
Leonard Tchulm,This was bad Fort Wayne bad.
Leslie Knope,Bummer.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for your time.
Leslie Knope,I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope,"I will see everyone at the gala, and I will see you in hell."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, you're too late, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,That lot is mine.
Leslie Knope,I can't hear you.
Leslie Knope,I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, so am I, so you can hear me! Ghost jammed!"
Jerry Gergich,We got all the way to Muncie before we realized that it was just a drill.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, all I'm saying is you could've called."
Tom Haverford,"No one had your cell number, Big ""J."""
Jerry Gergich,I find that hard to believe.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why is everyone standing around? We have work to do."
Leslie Knope,Status report.
Leslie Knope,Status report! Well
Leslie Knope,"Nope, we don't have time for that."
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna have to postpone the gala, but we can't, because the deadline is tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I destroyed the entire town for nothing."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You did all this? How did you get food?
Tom Haverford,I had a classic stroke of Haverford genius.
Tom Haverford,Who has the most to lose from a new Paunch Burger? Their competitors.
Tom Haverford,I got all the other fast food places in town to donate food.
Tom Haverford,"I know black tie and chicky tenders isn't the best mix, but"
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom, I love it."
Leslie Knope,"And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens."
Leslie Knope,How did you get the word out?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron went on Joan's show and kicked ass."
Ron Swanson,I also helped a child perform a tracheotomy on his elderly uncle.
Ron Swanson,It's been a very rewarding day.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I told the firemen they should use the lot as triage and then gave them and all the dead and wounded two free drink tickets."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,This is great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Let's start the gala.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and thanks for dressing up, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Chief Fugleberg."
Chief Fugleberg,Hey.
Chief Fugleberg,"That's your buddy Andy Dwyer over there, isn't it? Such a shame."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,Did he fail his test?
Chief Fugleberg,It's weird.
Chief Fugleberg,"He got 100% on his written test, first guy in history to do it, but he failed his personality examination."
Chief Fugleberg,"He's a sweet kid, just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Andy."
Chief Fugleberg,Too bad.
Chief Fugleberg,He's certainly something of a genius.
Chief Fugleberg,We could use his brains on the force.
Andy Dwyer,Official police wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer,You can't hit me.
Andy Dwyer,Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer,"Or here, no, try, it's this hand."
Andy Dwyer,Wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer,"Boom, too much pain, you can't even hit me."
Andy Dwyer,Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer,"If I had my gun, you wouldn't try to hit me, though, is the thing."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, if I could have everyone's attention please? I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago, we have reached our fundraising goal."
Leslie Knope,"Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project."
Leslie Knope,"And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community, my friends."
Leslie Knope,"It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again, but it bears repeating, No one achieves anything alone."
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, the best band in Pawnee, Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,"Park we will build it, the park it's not built yet, the park soon there will be a park"
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I thought you should see why Leslie tanked the drill.
Ann Perkins,"Councilman Jamm used you as a stalling tactic, hoping it would kill Leslie's park project."
Ann Perkins,"If the test were any other day, Leslie would have aced it."
Leonard Tchulm,I believe you.
Leonard Tchulm,Maybe I'll find my way back here in a month for a redo.
Ann Perkins,I appreciate it.
Ann Perkins,Have you ever thought of being a sperm donor?
Leonard Tchulm,I'm impotent.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
Leslie Knope,This is the best wedding present ever.
Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we only have three more months."
Leslie Knope,I can't wait three more months.
Leslie Knope,"God, I just hate the feeling of not being married to you."
Ben Wyatt,"Well Let's just do it, then."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's get married Here, tonight."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're all in black tie."
Ben Wyatt,"We've got plenty of food and entertainment And you did want to invite the whole town to the wedding, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married Tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Breaking news, I've just been handed this."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit by a devastating earthquake.
Leslie Knope,"We go to our reporter, live, Winnifred Makepiece, for the story."
Leslie Knope,Winnifred?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,I'm here at the Pawnee Weather Center with celebrated geologist Isabella Winchester.
Leslie Knope,"Isabella, can you tell us more about this killer earthquake?"
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Winnifred, the earthquake registered an 8."
Leslie Knope,5 on the Richter scale.
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,It was a large one.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"From all of us here at Channel 4 News, I'm Jessica Rabrit."
Leslie Knope,Have a good evening and be safe out there.
