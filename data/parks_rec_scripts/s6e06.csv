Tom Haverford,Business at RentaSwag could not be better.
Tom Haverford,"Yesterday Jaden Smith came in, and he was like, ""Look, I want to quit the music/acting business and work here with you."""
Tom Haverford,"And I was like, ""Jaden, be serious."""
Tom Haverford,The world needs you.
Tom Haverford,You have a gift.
Trevor Nelson,"Ever since my client opened his store across the street, your sales have plummeted."
Trevor Nelson,It's only a matter of time before you're out of business.
Trevor Nelson,"But my client has had a moment of weakness, something he referred to as ""sympathy""?"
Trevor Nelson,"He's made you a final offer 40,000 dollars for RentaSwag and all of its contents."
Trevor Nelson,I suggest you take it.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I've heard all the facts, and it's pretty obvious what I have to do-- Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put on my thinking PJs, and get back to you."
Trevor Nelson,The offer is valid for 48 hours.
Trevor Nelson,We would also be interested in acquiring your thinking PJs.
Tom Haverford,Listen to me very carefully.
Tom Haverford,"No matter what happens, you will never acquire my thinking PJs or my YouTube blazer... Nonnegotiable."
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time."
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Jerry Gergich,I was voting for you in the recall election.
Jerry Gergich,Lots of people wearing Leslie Knope buttons.
Leslie Knope,No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Let's focus on what we can control.
Leslie Knope,"In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen."
April Ludgate,There's been a mistake.
April Ludgate,"This says that I'm in charge of the silly skeleton room, when really it should say ""the undead serial killer room."""
April Ludgate,Who do I talk to about changing this?
Leslie Knope,It's recall day.
Leslie Knope,"I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I got stuff to do."
Leslie Knope,I'm planning a haunted house.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, um... It's Kevin Pollack's birthday."
Leslie Knope,That's something to focus on today.
Leslie Knope,Who cares about the recall?
Leslie Knope,It's Kevin's day.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do I could take the offer and break even, but I've come so far."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can you put some more tiny marshmallow in my hot chocky?"
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"If there was something I could do for you, I would."
Ron Swanson,Maybe you should try taking a walk... Out of my office.
Donna Meagle,Ron!
Donna Meagle,You're in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh?
Donna Meagle,Ron is in Bloosh!
Ron Swanson,What is Bloosh?
Tom Haverford,Bloosh is a weekly lifestyle email written by Annabel Porter.
Tom Haverford,She used to be the face of the Eagleton phone book.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming friends with a bunch of celebrities.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved back to become a lifestyle guru.
Tom Haverford,She's legit.
Tom Haverford,She spent four months living in Kate Bosworth's pool house.
Tom Haverford,"""A Ron Swanson designed chair is the musthave item of the season, along with red quinoa, wind therapy, and buying an island."""
Donna Meagle,Annabel says that buying an island is the only real way to know that your goji-berry farm is pesticide-free.
Tom Haverford,I've been trying to get RentaSwag in Bloosh for months.
Tom Haverford,"And now that you got in, I can get in too."
Tom Haverford,"Congratulations, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,We did it!
Donna Meagle,Someone's getting a new leather jacket.
Ron Swanson,I don't want a leather jacket.
Donna Meagle,It's for me.
Donna Meagle,This is a great day!
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,Do it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Chris Traeger,"April, you seem depressed, and I would know."
Chris Traeger,I spent most of last year being treated by Dr. Richard Nygard for my own emotional problems.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just miss Andy."
April Ludgate,"Halloween was, like, kind of our thing."
April Ludgate,"Every year, we would dress up like demons and egg Larry's house."
Jerry Gergich,That was you?
Chris Traeger,"Larry, please."
Chris Traeger,We're having a private conversation.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'd like to make Halloween fun for you, like Andy would have, starting right now... With scary, scary monster claws!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Larry, you had the easiest job, Two triangles and a tooth."
Leslie Knope,Nobody wants Gengurch family themed Jackolanterns.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle likes them.
Leslie Knope,Is any of this even good?
Leslie Knope,"Why didn't we call it ""City Halloween""?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to change every single banner."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's been holding it together pretty well, but today is when she needs us the most."
Ann Perkins,That's why we formed the Leslie Knope emotional support task force.
Ben Wyatt,"Anything she could possibly need to get her through these final hours, we got it covered"
Ben Wyatt,"Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles and birds becoming friends"
Ann Perkins,A poster announcing the new Lilith Fair concert.
Ann Perkins,"It's fake, but it'll buy us an hour."
Ben Wyatt,We even have a secret hand signal in case we think she needs help.
Ben Wyatt,It's loosely based on the Klingon greeting salute.
Ann Perkins,I just learned that.
Ann Perkins,"And if I had known, I would not have agreed to it."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of slightly changing a lot of banners, we paint our toenails to look like pumpkins?"
Leslie Knope,Fun!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're a genius!"
Leslie Knope,Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron, baby, what are the hot deets on Bloosh?"
Ron Swanson,Start over and speak differently.
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Did you call that P.R. guy?
Tom Haverford,What's the latest news?
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Joan Callamezzo wants me to go on Pawnee Today to discuss my chairs with this Porter woman."
Ron Swanson,I said no.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you said if there was something you could do to help me, you would."
Tom Haverford,Getting in Bloosh is my last chance to save my store.
Tom Haverford,You have to go and take me so I can meet her.
Tom Haverford,Please?
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"If it's that important to your company, I'll do it."
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,"Now, I know highend, Internet only lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene, so Donna and I wrote up some cocktail banter and some conversation snippets for you to practice so you can fit in."
Ron Swanson,"""Annabel, could I be more jels of your lowlights right now?"""
Ron Swanson,"""I mean, O.M.Squee, talk about bangs envy."""
Donna Meagle,"Oof, you got a long way to go, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"Let's go again, from the top."
Ron Swanson,I regret everything.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, you made it."
Ben Wyatt,It's 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, great work, as always."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna stay here and just kind of wait for the results to pour in.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you all tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,We're not going anywhere.
Ann Perkins,We're staying with you.
Leslie Knope,"No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it."
Ron Swanson,"We're not leaving, woman."
Ron Swanson,Stop trying to get rid of us.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I made frappuccinos for a little caffeine boost, and Larry went to get pizzas for everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, that's very sweet, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's hunker down."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a long night.
Perd Hapley,"Too close to call, a real nailbiter, anybody's game"
Perd Hapley,"These are three phrases you won't hear tonight, as Leslie Knope has been voted out of office."
Perd Hapley,What was expected to be a close race
Leslie Knope,What did he say?
Perd Hapley,Has actually been a not close race.
Perd Hapley,Pawnee voters have decisively removed Leslie Knope
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I'm so sorry."
Perd Hapley,From the City Council.
Jerry Gergich,"I gota the pizza pizza time, it'sa pizza time!"
Chris Traeger,"Larry, everyone is miserable, and you are only making it worse."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie's on her way in."
Ann Perkins,Is she okay?
Ann Perkins,"I left her, like, and her outgoing message is just her sobbing and burping and crazy laughing."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,She's actually handling it pretty well.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, fartwads?"
Chris Traeger,Are you eating a paunch burger?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?"
Leslie Knope,What does it matter?
Leslie Knope,Nothing matters anymore.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is good.
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,Why did I ever fight this?
Chris Traeger,Have you thought about a concession speech?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, concession speech?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I wrote one."
Chris Traeger,"""Eat my shorts, Jabronies."""
Chris Traeger,"""Knope, out."""
Ben Wyatt,I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.
Ben Wyatt,But we should focus on the haunted house.
Ben Wyatt,"And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papier-mache Li'l Sebastian!"
Ann Perkins,What?
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.
Joan Callamezzo,I can honestly say today's guest is the only person in this town who's a bigger deal than I am.
Joan Callamezzo,Please welcome lifestyle guru Annabel Porter.
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Annabel Porter,It's me.
Annabel Porter,I'm here.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, you are."
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say, as a journalist, I feel like we're best friends."
Joan Callamezzo,Tell the audience about yourself.
Annabel Porter,"Well, I'm just a simple former phonebook model who found her calling."
Annabel Porter,"You know, I'm not perfect."
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Annabel Porter,The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.
Annabel Porter,So does my nanny.
Annabel Porter,So I get it.
Joan Callamezzo,"Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?"
Annabel Porter,"First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new cast-iron stove."
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Annabel Porter,"I have found some amazing new conflict free paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls."
Joan Callamezzo,Thank God.
Donna Meagle,Finally.
Annabel Porter,But my fave new item is a deliciously bold chair
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Annabel Porter,By local artist Ron Swanson.
Joan Callamezzo,Ron Swanson is here.
Joan Callamezzo,"He will be joining us after the break, so stick around."
Ron Swanson,"Did that woman call my chair ""delicious""?"
Jerry Gergich,"Whoo, Happy Halloween."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, caterpillar!"
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the den of horrors.
Extra,Where's all the scary stuff?
Leslie Knope,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah. Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher."
Extra,Can we have some candy?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan. The truth."
Leslie Knope,It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.
Leslie Knope,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's say goodbye to Ms. Knope, kids."
Leslie Knope,It is Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over."
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Annabel Porter,"I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, mostly you use it for sitting."
Annabel Porter,Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.
Annabel Porter,"Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent."
Ron Swanson,Put it by a table and eat a meal.
Annabel Porter,We don't do meals in my home.
Annabel Porter,"No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say-- And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up-- I love your hair."
Annabel Porter,Oh.
Annabel Porter,Thank you.
Annabel Porter,It's genetic and unattainable.
Chris Traeger,I am scaring you!
April Ludgate,I could see you.
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me."
April Ludgate,"And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?"
Chris Traeger,What about this?
Chris Traeger,"I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard."
April Ludgate,Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.
April Ludgate,He's an FBI agent.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Chris Traeger,That's even harder to believe.
April Ludgate,"Just stop, okay?"
April Ludgate,Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.
April Ludgate,Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,"I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I am really sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I know you must feel awful.
Leslie Knope,I don't feel awful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax."
Leslie Knope,Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
Ben Wyatt,"I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal."
Ben Wyatt,But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.
Leslie Knope,Or do you?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked."""
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a great run.
Leslie Knope,And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"But, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, see, iit was important for me-- See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?"
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Drink up.
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Shots!
Donna Meagle,B13 shots.
Donna Meagle,Bird bath salts.
Donna Meagle,Wha?
Donna Meagle,Champagne decanters!
Donna Meagle,This is heaven.
Extra,I love your chair.
Extra,I need 12 for my stepdaughter's craft room.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years."
Extra,Can you put me on the wait list?
Extra,Me too Unless your chair was ever touched by someone who ate refined sugar.
Extra,"Then I can't buy any of your chairs, and I protest this entire event."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Ron, Annabels coming over."
Tom Haverford,"When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories."
Annabel Porter,There he is.
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter."
Annabel Porter,"No, thank us."
Annabel Porter,You are about to make a ton of money.
Annabel Porter,I want to license your designs.
Annabel Porter,We are going to put Swanson chairs in every six bedroom home in the Midwest.
Ron Swanson,"If my chairs were mass produced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs."
Ron Swanson,Swanson chairs are handmade.
Annabel Porter,"Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford."
Ron Swanson,He's a big fan of your... Whatever you call what you do.
Ron Swanson,Please speak to each other while I leave.
Annabel Porter,"Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so."
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"I had my time, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I did my thing.
Leslie Knope,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!"
Leslie Knope,"And the people were like, pffft!"
Ben Wyatt,At least we have each other.
Leslie Knope,I love you so much.
Ben Wyatt,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,This is real.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Leslie Knope,You're my husband.
Ben Wyatt,You're my wife.
Leslie Knope,You married me in front of people.
Ben Wyatt,I did.
Ben Wyatt,I was there.
Leslie Knope,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,What is it?
Leslie Knope,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, sir."
Ben Wyatt,We are sober.
Leslie Knope,"We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other."
Herman,Tattoos?
Herman,This is a pawnshop.
Herman,"But, yeah, sure, I can do that."
Ben Wyatt,Awww!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,It happened!
Leslie Knope,Look what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,He's breaking pens.
Ben Wyatt,This is the idea of the century.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Tom Haverford,My store is called RentaSwag.
Tom Haverford,It's a clothing rental service for teens.
Annabel Porter,It's an interesting idea.
Annabel Porter,Are you guys doing well?
Tom Haverford,We're doing amazing.
Annabel Porter,Mm.
Tom Haverford,And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about RentaSwag instead?
Annabel Porter,This month's trends are final.
Annabel Porter,I can't just throw a trend out.
Annabel Porter,But my Bloosh scouts have started trendtracking for the February zine blast.
Ron Swanson,"Good God, these words."
Annabel Porter,I'll have them stop by your store.
Tom Haverford,That'll be too late.
Tom Haverford,We'll be out of business by then.
Annabel Porter,I thought you said you were doing well.
Annabel Porter,"Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?"
Annabel Porter,I can sell your chairs on my site.
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.
Annabel Porter,"Well, that's too bad."
Annabel Porter,This party is over.
Annabel Porter,It no longer is.
Annabel Porter,It was.
Tom Haverford,It was?
Tom Haverford,That was my last shot.
Donna Meagle,"Sorry, Tommy."
Donna Meagle,Let's just grab some of that lychee body oil and bounce.
Tom Haverford,Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?
Donna Meagle,Fo' sho'.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question?
Leslie Knope,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?
Herman,Nope.
Herman,"Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?"
Herman,Doesn't matter.
Herman,Can't find a short needle.
Herman,Long needle it is.
Leslie Knope,I have a big idea.
Leslie Knope,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm."
Leslie Knope,And that's very subtle.
Leslie Knope,"No, scratch that."
Leslie Knope,Scratch all that.
Leslie Knope,"Just write ""Ben""."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have anything to numb the pain?
Herman,"Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket."
Herman,"Okay, you said you wanted ""mouth queen""?"
Ann Perkins,"No, stop."
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Ann Perkins,Stop everything that you're doing.
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,Ann's here!
Leslie Knope,Ann wants a tattoo!
Ben Wyatt,Ann!
Ann Perkins,"No, no!"
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Shh!
Ann Perkins,Ann does not want a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,No one wants a tattoo.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?"
Leslie Knope,What we are doing is not nuts.
Leslie Knope,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.
Ben Wyatt,It makes a lot of sense.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we're leaving, all right?"
Ann Perkins,So say goodbye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, world traveler."
Ben Wyatt,"Later, bro Heisen."
Ann Perkins,Go.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"I don't want to be a failure again, Ron."
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort.
Tom Haverford,Easy for you to say.
Tom Haverford,"People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it."
Ron Swanson,I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name.
Ron Swanson,The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone-- Your name.
Tom Haverford,My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.
Ann Perkins,"Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force?"
Ben Wyatt,Don't let her get a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,What the hell happened?
Ben Wyatt,I couldn't help it.
Ben Wyatt,She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas.
Ann Perkins,Never send a husband to do a best friend's job.
Ann Perkins,"Out, Wyatt."
Ann Perkins,Walk it off.
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"- What? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,You were down in the polls.
Ann Perkins,Your opponents were well funded and well organized.
Ann Perkins,You must have known this would be a possibility.
Leslie Knope,"Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought"
Ann Perkins,"Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job."
Ann Perkins,I wrote this. You need to hear yourself read this.
Leslie Knope,"""They held the recall election, and I lost."""
Leslie Knope,"""I was voted out of office."""
Leslie Knope,"""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk."
Ann Perkins,Keep going.
Leslie Knope,"""But I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am more than a city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am an unstoppable force of energy."""
Leslie Knope,"""And I will use those days to work as hard as I can."""
Ann Perkins,"These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,You have things to do.
Ann Perkins,You have a month left.
Ann Perkins,Use it.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I flushed my car keys down the toilet.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
April Ludgate,Eww stop.
Ann Perkins,"Hello to you too, April."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay? You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so"
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, April."
Chris Traeger,Happy Halloween.
Chris Traeger,"And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me."
April Ludgate,You guys are cute.
Ann Perkins,Where'd that come from?
April Ludgate,I'm weak.
April Ludgate,"I miss Andy, and it's making me weak."
April Ludgate,"Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect."
April Ludgate,Or he's secretly super in love with me.
April Ludgate,It's probably that.
Chris Traeger,"That's a funny joke, April."
Chris Traeger,"But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann."
April Ludgate,"Okay, gross."
April Ludgate,The spell's broken.
Tom Haverford,"I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms."
Trevor Nelson,Which are?
Tom Haverford,"40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag."
Tom Haverford,"It's mine, and I'm keeping it."
Trevor Nelson,The name is actually an important part of the sale.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Trevor Nelson,Yes.
Trevor Nelson,My client likes the name.
Trevor Nelson,It's better than Tommy's Closet.
Trevor Nelson,He needs the name.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for 20,000 more and 5% of your client's business."
Trevor Nelson,"I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal."
Tom Haverford,"Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman."
Tom Haverford,I am.
Tom Haverford,And now I have seed money for my next venture.
Tom Haverford,"I sold out, baby."
Leslie Knope,"The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled."
Leslie Knope,"I am, of course, disappointed."
Leslie Knope,"But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city."
Ben Wyatt,The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job.
Ben Wyatt,She's never down for that long.
Ann Perkins,"And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap."
Leslie Knope,Hey! There you guys are.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing."
Leslie Knope,"Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you."
Leslie Knope,"And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin"
Leslie Knope,No surprise.
Leslie Knope,Love you both.
Leslie Knope,See you later.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt,Not bad.
