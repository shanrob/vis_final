Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't find the article about you teaching sex ed to seniors, but I did find this folder labeled ""Senior sex ed thank you notes."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, don't open that."
Leslie Knope,There's pictures in there.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,There are pictures.
Ben Wyatt,There are lots of pictures.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you not throw these away or incinerate them?
Leslie Knope,Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.
Leslie Knope,Even the saggy ones.
Leslie Knope,I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.
Leslie Knope,This year whizzed by so fast.
Leslie Knope,There was so much more I wanted to do.
Leslie Knope,But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.
Leslie Knope,It's actually one of the subtitles of my scrapbook.
Leslie Knope,Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.
Ben Wyatt,Ben and Leslie's day off.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go relax.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait for our day off.
Leslie Knope,But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?
Leslie Knope,"That sounds pretty sexy, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you've worked nonstop."
Ben Wyatt,Holidays and weekends.
Ben Wyatt,You're just gonna take a day off.
Ben Wyatt,It'll be good for you.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You're cute.
Leslie Knope,And you're right.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April."
Leslie Knope,"I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?"
April Ludgate,"We are all out of water, actually."
April Ludgate,I'll have to use boiling hot milk.
Leslie Knope,Are you really gonna do that?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, everybody."
Jerry Gergich,"Um, wow."
Jerry Gergich,It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with you all.
Jerry Gergich,The time I have spent at Parks and Rec have been the happiest days of my life here in the government.
Jerry Gergich,"And I know everyone says it, but I sincerely hope that we stay in touch."
Leslie Knope,What the [Bleep] is happening right now?
Jerry Gergich,"Today's my last day, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,I'm retiring.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell us?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I didn't want to make a big fuss."
Jerry Gergich,"Although, gosh, I'm pretty sure I mentioned it a few times."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, God, they're gonna fire people, aren't they?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I am two years from my pension."
Jerry Gergich,Can you believe it?
Jerry Gergich,Only six months left until I retire.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
April Ludgate,What did Jerry say?
Tom Haverford,Jerry was here?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, this is my last weep."
Jerry Gergich,Oops.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, ""weep."""
Jerry Gergich,Week.
Jerry Gergich,Geez.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just wait.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear."
Leslie Knope,We have to commemorate this somehow.
Ron Swanson,You're right.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, thank you for your service."
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,That speech means a lot.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, I am going to go and say goodbye to some other folks."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, see you tomorrow, Jerry."
Extra,"So we ran all your tests, and everything looks great."
Extra,You might be the healthiest human being we've ever seen.
Extra,You have the resting heart rate of a 100 year old tortoise.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I get that a lot."
Chris Traeger,So my childhood illness there's no chance I would pass that on?
Extra,"It wasn't genetic, so you shouldn't worry at all."
Extra,You have every reason to expect a healthy child.
Extra,"In fact, if you'd like, you can provide your sample today."
Ann Perkins,Today?
Ann Perkins,"Like, today, today?"
Chris Traeger,This today?
Extra,"Well, yes."
Extra,"I mean, the timing is right according to Ann's ovulation schedule."
Extra,Unless there's a reason you'd like to wait till next month.
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,None.
Chris Traeger,One other question.
Chris Traeger,Completely off topic.
Chris Traeger,Would I be providing this sample today?
Leslie Knope,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it."
Leslie Knope,"This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, why would anyone be so mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,I wrote this.
Leslie Knope,I stand by it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it."
Leslie Knope,"That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at his original entry paperwork."
Leslie Knope,"He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'll help with anything."
Ben Wyatt,Just promise we'll do it quickly.
Ben Wyatt,I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for
Leslie Knope,Mac and cheese pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're making that?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.
April Ludgate,After making out with you.
Andy Dwyer,Remember when we did both at the same time?
Andy Dwyer,It made him so uncomfortable.
Tom Haverford,This is a sad day.
Tom Haverford,Who are we gonna make fun of now?
Ron Swanson,No need to worry.
Ron Swanson,"Every place I've ever worked in has had a ""Jerry."""
Ron Swanson,"When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role."
Ron Swanson,It's Social Darwinism.
Ron Swanson,The strong prey on the weak.
Ron Swanson,"Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, nature."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,My transfer was approved.
Ann Perkins,"So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board."
Ann Perkins,"You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest."
Ann Perkins,Clear sailing.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess."
Extra,So here's the drill.
Extra,Make a deposit in here.
Extra,"If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board."
Extra,"Then we take the sample, spin it in the centrifuge, and prepare it for fertilization."
Chris Traeger,Sounds romantic.
Chris Traeger,I guess it's go time.
Ann Perkins,Go time!
Ann Perkins,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Ann Perkins,I don't go with you.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no."
Chris Traeger,I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.
Chris Traeger,And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.
Chris Traeger,And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.
Chris Traeger,Should I think about you?
Chris Traeger,This is so weird.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we don't have to do this today."
Ann Perkins,This was totally just sprung on us.
Ann Perkins,Let's just take a moment.
Ann Perkins,There's so many pamphlets to look at.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do."
Chris Traeger,"Excellent idea, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Do I keep this?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,It feels wrong to leave it here.
Ann Perkins,Give it to me.
Ann Perkins,I panicked.
Ann Perkins,Run!
Tom Haverford,Here are the last of the Animal Control reports.
April Ludgate,"What are you doing, weirdo?"
Tom Haverford,Just trying not to spill anything.
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.
Tom Haverford,Way ahead of you.
Tom Haverford,I made two pile files.
Tom Haverford,Pilo fibles.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,Filo pilos.
Andy Dwyer,Filo pilos?
Andy Dwyer,That's not right.
Donna Meagle,Are you broken?
Tom Haverford,"No, everything's fine."
April Ludgate,"Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is."
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!"
Tom Haverford,I barely even said it wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Said it wrong.
Tom Haverford,Stop it!
Tom Haverford,This is how it begins.
Tom Haverford,"The next ""Jerry."""
Tom Haverford,"One screwed-up sentence, and 30 years later, I'm wearing aquamarine sweater vests and listening to Bonnie Raitt and The da Vinci Code on my iPod."
Tom Haverford,It's already started.
Leslie Knope,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once."
Leslie Knope,Young and full of dreams.
Jerry Gergich,I forgot I wrote all this.
Leslie Knope,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them."
Leslie Knope,So let's see what's first.
Leslie Knope,"""Eat in city council private dining room."""
Leslie Knope,That we can achieve.
Jerry Gergich,Right now?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Extra,Authorized personnel only.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, they're with me."
Leslie Knope,"City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four."
Extra,Guests are only allowed on Wednesdays.
Extra,And we don't have clearance levels.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but shouldn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it sounds so cool."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture."
Leslie Knope,"He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here."
Extra,His dream?
Extra,Really?
Extra,Still no.
Jerry Gergich,"It's okay, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,But thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you for trying.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, just okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I put my arm around nothing.
Leslie Knope,"And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?"
Extra,Congratulations on your retirement.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,"One, three, seven, two, five, nine."
Andy Dwyer,Pffft!
Andy Dwyer,Sudoku is easy.
Andy Dwyer,Is there even rules to this game?
Tom Haverford,"There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown."
Tom Haverford,And it's not me.
Tom Haverford,It's Andy.
Tom Haverford,Big guy?
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,Goofy?
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,"All I have to do is wait for a textbook Dwyer screwup, which usually happens, mm, every 20 minutes."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, real creative, Donna."
Tom Haverford,You expect that to catch on?
April Ludgate,"Babe, the pen."
Tom Haverford,Look at Andy.
Tom Haverford,There's ink all over him.
Tom Haverford,Andy's the new Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Game over.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm like a giant squid."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, honey, I'm ink Dracula."
April Ludgate,"No, stop."
Andy Dwyer,Squid Dracula is going to get you.
Donna Meagle,"Barking up the wrong tree, Filo."
Tom Haverford,What do you mean?
Donna Meagle,Andy will never be the new Jerry.
Donna Meagle,Nothing embarrasses him.
Donna Meagle,He's like a giant puppy with no shame.
Donna Meagle,What you need is some fresh meat in the office.
Tom Haverford,Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,He was the mayor at the time.
Jerry Gergich,I've always wanted to meet him.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, today you're getting that chance."
Ben Wyatt,So was he like a really great mayor?
Leslie Knope,"No, not really."
Leslie Knope,"He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills."
Leslie Knope,But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.
Leslie Knope,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds like a good dude.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death."
Jerry Gergich,But this is nice too.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go over there."
Leslie Knope,Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
Leslie Knope,I'll take your picture.
Jerry Gergich,Butterflies.
Jerry Gergich,"Hello, Mr. Mayor."
Jerry Gergich,"First of all, I'm so sorry that those Serbian mobsters shoved you out of that helicopter."
Jerry Gergich,You deserve better.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor."
Ben Wyatt,Can we please just call it a day?
Leslie Knope,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing."
Leslie Knope,Is that what you want?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then."
Jerry Gergich,It's really been nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, let's go."
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Ronfire of the vanities.
Ron Swanson,Filo Pilo.
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
Tom Haverford,"Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack."
Ron Swanson,A new person in the office?
Tom Haverford,Not a person.
Tom Haverford,An intern.
Ron Swanson,Why on earth would I get an intern?
Tom Haverford,Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.
Tom Haverford,"And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible."
Tom Haverford,So they get no work done.
Tom Haverford,It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, son."
Ron Swanson,That is one compelling argument.
Ron Swanson,"Keep it up, Filo."
Ron Swanson,We may destroy this government one day after all.
Chris Traeger,These pamphlets are fascinating.
Chris Traeger,"It says here that some men gain ""sympathy weight"" when their partners get pregnant."
Chris Traeger,"If that happens to me, I'd be miserable."
Chris Traeger,But happy.
Chris Traeger,But sad.
Ann Perkins,I would have never imagined the babymaking process to be this clinical.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this."
Chris Traeger,Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.
Chris Traeger,And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those physical activities.
Ann Perkins,Exactly.
Ann Perkins,And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Ann Perkins,"You know, is this all the pamphlets?"
Ann Perkins,'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those."
Ann Perkins,Let's find those.
Chris Traeger,We need to find those.
Ann Perkins,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone gather around."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00."
Jerry Gergich,"She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean."
April Ludgate,"Gross, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,She made a meatloaf.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is better than meatloaf."
Leslie Knope,"When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,"Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record."
Leslie Knope,But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.
Leslie Knope,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Hear, hear."
Jerry Gergich,"""Jerry Gergich Memorial Conference Room. R.I.P.""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,So bring out the cake!
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Speech, speech, speech."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, thank you, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm not much of a speechmaker, but I do like good cake."
Jerry Gergich,Delicious.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you're on fire."
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would."
Jerry Gergich,I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.
Jerry Gergich,I guess this is it.
Jerry Gergich,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,"See you tomorrow, Jeremy."
Tom Haverford,"Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?"
Tom Haverford,Hard to make fun of that.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, the cake."
Andy Dwyer,Filo Pilo ruined the cake.
April Ludgate,Classic Pilo.
Tom Haverford,What how is that my fault?
Tom Haverford,Stupid Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Should have never saved his life.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a second?
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, this is a lovely surprise."
Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,Have breakfast with the family.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.
Gayle Gergich,Is that Leslie Knope?
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi, Gayle."
Gayle Gergich,What a surprise.
Gayle Gergich,I insist you join us for breakfast.
Gayle Gergich,This guy is the greatest breakfast chef in the world.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Your purse is shaped like a waffle.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Gayle Gergich,Please join us.
Gayle Gergich,The Gergiches don't take no for an answer.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmm.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,"Girls, we've got company."
Donna Meagle,"So, you want to get out of here?"
Extra,"Work just started, Ms. Meagle."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, but our work is just beginning."
Donna Meagle,You know what I'm saying?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, Donna, who's the new boy toy?"
Extra,"I'm Taylor, the new intern."
Tom Haverford,This is the new intern?
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie."
April Ludgate,He was a big deal on the football team.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, meathead jock type, huh?"
Extra,"Actually, I quit football senior year so I could help my pastor run a homeless shelter."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Pfftt!
Tom Haverford,"This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Anybody would be lucky to marry him.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?"
Extra,"Wish I could, man, but I'm not a ""marriage"" dude."
Extra,"I've got a lot of love to give, and it just seems unfair to put boundaries on it."
Donna Meagle,He gets it.
Donna Meagle,You so get it.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey."
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Should I keep walking towards you?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk."
Ann Perkins,"Or you know what, we could meet in the middle."
Chris Traeger,Great plan.
Ann Perkins,Hello.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Welp.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, ask me if I'm sad."
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I'm the new Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Well, is whining going to do anything about it?"
Ron Swanson,You don't want to be a whipping boy.
Ron Swanson,Stand up for yourself.
Tom Haverford,"You don't understand, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I already was Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"I was a skinny Indian kid in South Carolina, and it sucked."
Tom Haverford,"It took me 12 years, but I reinvented myself."
Tom Haverford,I'm a business owner.
Tom Haverford,I wear dope suits.
Tom Haverford,I have fur underwear.
Tom Haverford,It was all for nothing.
Tom Haverford,I'm back to being a Jerry.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.
Tom Haverford,Might as well lean into it.
Ron Swanson,Tom can take care of himself.
Ron Swanson,He's a grown man.
Ron Swanson,"Well, half grown."
Ron Swanson,He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12 year olds.
Jerry Gergich,"Eggs, bacon, and toast eggs, bacon, and toast why don't you start your day the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me?"
Leslie Knope,toast.
Jerry Gergich,"eggs, bacon, and toast eggs, bacon, and toast why don't you start your day the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and Toast"
Jerry Gergich,Very good.
Millicent Gergich,We sing that every morning.
Gayle Gergich,But it's an extra treat because you're here to sing it with us.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down."
Jerry Gergich,No!
Leslie Knope,So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my god well, look."
Gayle Gergich,"Oh, honey."
Gayle Gergich,You look great in every one of these.
Gayle Gergich,You are still the most handsome man in the world to me.
Millicent Gergich,Ugh.
Millicent Gergich,"Mom, come on."
Millicent Gergich,"Yeah, Geez, mom."
Millicent Gergich,We're eating.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't make any sense."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, that is really sweet of you, but you don't have to worry about me."
Jerry Gergich,I'm great.
Jerry Gergich,Here.
Jerry Gergich,I want to show you something.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"No! You also dropped that, clumsy."
Leslie Knope,Where am I?
Jerry Gergich,"I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00."
Jerry Gergich,"And to me, that's what mattered most."
Jerry Gergich,Little Sebastian
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for sharing this with me.
Leslie Knope,I-- You have a wonderful life.
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,Aw.
Millicent Gergich,Group hug.
Jerry Gergich,"Uhoh, here they are."
Jerry Gergich,The hug machine is here.
Jerry Gergich,The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this."
Chris Traeger,I would love to.
Ann Perkins,I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us?
Ann Perkins,"Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann? I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I completely agree."
Ann Perkins,"But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically."
Chris Traeger,Of course.
Chris Traeger,We should discuss and consider all the possibilities.
Chris Traeger,The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child.
Chris Traeger,And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to make out?
Chris Traeger,I really do.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, Jerry? I thought you were fired."
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't fired.
Jerry Gergich,I retired.
Andy Dwyer,That's what they all say.
Ron Swanson,I asked Jerry to come in.
Ron Swanson,"That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him."
Donna Meagle,"Once again, I object in the strongest possible terms."
Ron Swanson,"Once again, noted."
Ron Swanson,I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just when we were rid of him?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't know, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Are you hearing me, son? Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it feels good just to be"
Andy Dwyer,Classic new guy.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry instead of relaxing with you.
Ben Wyatt,It's all right.
Ben Wyatt,"And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes."
Ben Wyatt,"As I suspected, airtight."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,This is all my fault.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,"But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail."
Leslie Knope,"Achievements are great, but I want more than that."
Leslie Knope,I want what Jerry has.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That sounds perfect.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was she a Russian spy and the KGB forced her to marry Jerry as a cover?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a mystery, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Let it go.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I can't."
Ben Wyatt,It keeps me awake at night.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, maybe Gayle has one of those Oliver Sacks brain disorder thingies?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, does she think Jerry is a friendly hat?"
Leslie Knope,I think you solved it.
