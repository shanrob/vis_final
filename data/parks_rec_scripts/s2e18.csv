Character,Line
Tom Haverford,Ann Perkins.
Tom Haverford,"What's happening, sweetheart?"
Ann Perkins,Just waiting for April.
Ann Perkins,"She's taking care of my house while I'm away, so--"
Tom Haverford,That's great.
Tom Haverford,Happy belated Valentine's Day.
Ann Perkins,Valentine's Day was a month ago.
Ann Perkins,Why are you giving it to me now?
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,Happy early Valentine's Day.
Tom Haverford,I saw this and I thought of you.
Tom Haverford,Hope you keep that somewhere special.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"This is one of those nanny cam teddy bears, isn't it?"
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"It's a regular, cameraless teddy bear."
Tom Haverford,"Just put it in your bedroom, don't even think about it."
Tom Haverford,It's a robot bear.
Tom Haverford,It's programmed to snuggle!
Donna Meagle,I'll take it.
Ann Perkins,"Donna, there's a camera in it."
Donna Meagle,I know.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,That's basically it.
Ann Perkins,"Water the plants, get the mail."
April Ludgate,Can I read your mail?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Please, don't."
April Ludgate,Fine.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"And here are the keys, and remember--"
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Don't let Tom make a copy.
Ann Perkins,That's right.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,I'm paying April 50 bucks to watch my house while I'm away.
Ann Perkins,"I would have asked Leslie, but I've seen the way she takes care of her house."
Ann Perkins,"Plus, there's always been a little distance between me and April."
Ann Perkins,"And I thought this would maybe, I don't know, give us a chance to get a little closer."
Ann Perkins,Maybe even--
April Ludgate,I don't like Ann.
Ann Perkins,Become friends.
Ann Perkins,Who knows?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Evelyn Rowshlind, from the mayor's office."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello!"
Leslie Knope,I've always dreamed of you.
Evelyn Rowshlind,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Meeting you.
Leslie Knope,What can I do for you?
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Evelyn Rowshlind,I prefer to stand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Evelyn Rowshlind,I have kind of an odd favor to ask.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Mayor Gunderson was playing golf last week at Pawnee Municipal, and he brought his dog and--"
Leslie Knope,Rufus.
Leslie Knope,We all know Rufus.
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves Rufus.
Leslie Knope,He's a great dog.
Leslie Knope,Continue.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, they were out on the sixth hole when suddenly, out of nowhere--"
Leslie Knope,Rufus was bitten by a possum?
Evelyn Rowshlind,Yes.
Evelyn Rowshlind,How did you know that?
Leslie Knope,It was Fairway Frank.
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.
Leslie Knope,"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria."
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?
Evelyn Rowshlind,Let's be honest.
Evelyn Rowshlind,Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.
Leslie Knope,They're a bunch of burned out morons.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, you have the reputation as a person who gets things done, so we'd like you to form a little task force, find the animal and put it down."
Leslie Knope,A task force?
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Needless to say, the mayor will be very grateful for your help."
Leslie Knope,"Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum."
Evelyn Rowshlind,Great.
Leslie Knope,Ron will show you around.
Ron Swanson,Right this way is the exit.
April Ludgate,"Yo, police!"
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're not."
Andy Dwyer,Coffee!
Andy Dwyer,You always know what to bring me.
April Ludgate,I only ever bring you coffee.
Andy Dwyer,"And it is my very favorite non-alcoholic hot drink, except for hot tea."
Andy Dwyer,"And hot orange juice, weirdly delicious."
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, thank you so much."
Andy Dwyer,I need it.
Andy Dwyer,I got a really bad case of shoeshine head today.
April Ludgate,"Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls ""shoeshine head."""
April Ludgate,It's when you shine too many shoes and the fumes create a thunderstorm in your brain.
April Ludgate,"Cures include coffee, cheeseburgers and napping on the floor."
Ron Swanson,Mark Brendanawicz!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron, what's up?"
Ron Swanson,"I have a woodshop, and I'm planning a little expansion."
Ron Swanson,"Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection."
Ron Swanson,That's not really necessary.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz,But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You don't have any code violations, do you?"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Eugene!
Leslie Knope,"Boy, we have a really important job for you."
Eugene,We'll get to it first thing Monday.
Leslie Knope,Today's Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is not a request."
Andy Dwyer,We're acting under direct orders from Mayor Gunderson's dog.
Leslie Knope,Office.
Leslie Knope,I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.
Eugene,That would be Harris and Brett.
Eugene,But they're not here.
Tom Haverford,"Isn't that them, there?"
Eugene,Nope.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brett."
Brett,Yeah?
Harris,Dude.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again."
Leslie Knope,"Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?"
Eugene,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Cool!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you want your ball back?"
Leslie Knope,Want your ball back?
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Harris,"Oh, man!"
Brett,"How you know my name, homie?"
Harris,"Stop, man!"
Brett,Stop hanging yourself.
Harris,I'm gonna hang yourself.
Brett,Stop hanging yourself.
Tom Haverford,"It's quite a crack team you've assembled, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum."
Leslie Knope,How hard can it be?
Leslie Knope,Excuse us!
Leslie Knope,Task force coming through!
Leslie Knope,Task force clear.
Leslie Knope,Resume golfing.
Tom Haverford,I used to love Tiger Woods because he was a great champion.
Tom Haverford,But after that sex scandal?
Tom Haverford,The man is a god!
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,Welcome to my haven.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You are the first non-me to set foot in this building in 10 years.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, none of this is up to code."
Ron Swanson,Sure it is.
Ron Swanson,It's up to the Swanson Code.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.
Mark Brendanawicz,You've got hazardous chemicals over here.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, which only I'm breathing."
Ron Swanson,It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.
Ron Swanson,Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a basket of oil soaked rags above a wood burning stove.
Ron Swanson,"Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code."
Mark Brendanawicz,This says it should be recharged June of 1996.
Ron Swanson,Those dates are arbitrary.
Ron Swanson,They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Ron Swanson,Observe.
Ron Swanson,Watch yourself.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'll replace this.
Ron Swanson,Happy?
Tom Haverford,"How long do you think it would take me to learn golf, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,I could teach you.
Leslie Knope,I have a 16 handicap.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice."
Leslie Knope,"You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't want to do all that."
Tom Haverford,I think I just want some of those dope pants.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,It's Fairway Frank!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I want you to very slowlyâ¦"
Tom Haverford,Move!
Tom Haverford,Get out of the way!
Mark Brendanawicz,"25, 26, 27, 28 violations."
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Brendanawicz, relax."
Ron Swanson,Let me make you a canoe.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I don't need a canoe, Ron."
Mark Brendanawicz,I need you to fix this place up.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I'll give you 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart."
Leslie Knope,"You two, flank the left."
Leslie Knope,I'll flank the right.
Leslie Knope,Andy will come in to--
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I got it!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Task force, engage!"
Andy Dwyer,I got him!
Harris,He's got it.
Brett,He's good.
Andy Dwyer,I got him.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, you cowards!"
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face.
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,We got him!
Andy Dwyer,It's okay.
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Leslie Knope,"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
Leslie Knope,"All right, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"You're next, Poopy."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Very impressive, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,I had a great task force.
Leslie Knope,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.
Leslie Knope,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing."
Evelyn Rowshlind,Mr. Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"Please, my friends call me Andy Radical."
Tom Haverford,"No, we don't."
Andy Dwyer,"By day, Andy Dwyer, shoeshineist."
Andy Dwyer,"By a different time of day, Andy Radical, possum tackler."
Andy Dwyer,"And by night, I do whatever I want."
Andy Dwyer,No job.
Evelyn Rowshlind,We think that this is a great PR opportunity.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"So, we've arranged for a reporter from the Journal to stop by to interview, get some pictures of the team."
Leslie Knope,Task force.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Evelyn Rowshlind,"And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I will!"
Leslie Knope,I need so many special favors.
Leslie Knope,Which one should I choose?
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, you don't have to choose right--"
Leslie Knope,How about an extra recycling can?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Laminated bus pass?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What time do you usually go to sleep?
Leslie Knope,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Let's stick to business hours, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"See you in hell, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Am I quite sure?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Am I sure enough?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Could I live with myself?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions."
Leslie Knope,Does doing so help me make decisions?
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?"
Andy Dwyer,How could I forget?
Andy Dwyer,You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.
Andy Dwyer,"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum."
Andy Dwyer,"Let me explain something to you, Tweep."
Andy Dwyer,"When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I thought to myself, ""Don't think, Andy, act."""
Tom Haverford,"So, you weren't thinking?"
Andy Dwyer,Not at all.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Were you scared?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I wasn't."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I I lived in the pit for the better part of last year, and made some vermin friends."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,"""Friends"" sounds stupid."
Andy Dwyer,Colleagues.
Andy Dwyer,"They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, your family must be very proud."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What does your girlfriend think?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The nurse.
Andy Dwyer,I broke up with Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, maybe this article will change her mind."
Andy Dwyer,What now?
Andy Dwyer,I hadn't even thought of that.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Of all the things I thought would bring us back together, catching a possum was never on that list."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,Of the possum.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, man, when you wear these clothes, you just feel better than everyone else."
Tom Haverford,You know?
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Busy?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's up?
Ron Swanson,"Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist."
Ron Swanson,And I understand that you enforce them.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,Can you sign off on my plans now?
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you get everything up to code?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, you didn't!"
Mark Brendanawicz,You clearly didn't!
Ron Swanson,"It's my property, my land, my shop."
Tom Haverford,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a banana.
Tom Haverford,You guys good?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?"
Tom Haverford,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Silly me.
Tom Haverford,There was this little pom-pom on my glove and it fell off.
Tom Haverford,Have you seen it?
Tom Haverford,Could you help me look for it real quick?
Tom Haverford,It should be on the ground somewhere.
Tom Haverford,When I was putting it up.
Tom Haverford,Let's see.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, how's your hole?"
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The pit.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Lot 48.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card."
Leslie Knope,"So, this isn't a really big story, right?"
Leslie Knope,Nobody cares about this very much.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, this could be on the front page."
Andy Dwyer,"Fairway Frank, You're gonna die, You're gonna fry, oh, yeah, You guilty son of a bitch, You're gonna fry, When they flip that switch."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?"
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale."
Leslie Knope,"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a big fish.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?"
April Ludgate,I don't know what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,I saw a second possum!
Leslie Knope,There was another possum!
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.
April Ludgate,"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not."
April Ludgate,Because I care so deeply about possums.
April Ludgate,Because they're so adorable.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Did you see my photo shoot?
Andy Dwyer,I think I nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,"I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay."
April Ludgate,That's cool.
April Ludgate,I'm really happy for you.
Andy Dwyer,You are?
Andy Dwyer,"Man, our happy reactions are super different."
Andy Dwyer,"So, he said he's gonna email me the photos in, like, six hours."
Andy Dwyer,Do you want to wait with me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters."
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.
Leslie Knope,You must know him pretty well.
Joe Campopiano,Sure do.
Joe Campopiano,I've chased that little sucker off more times than I can count.
April Ludgate,Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?
Joe Campopiano,"Yup, that's him."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums."
Joe Campopiano,Huh.
Joe Campopiano,You guys want something to drink?
Mike,"Hey, boss."
Mike,There's a possum wandering around on the 14th green.
Mike,Should I call Animal Control again?
Joe Campopiano,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Those idiots are here from Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna take it away.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Can you do that, April?"
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do that?"
Leslie Knope,Can you get the possum out of here?
Leslie Knope,Can you sneak it out of here?
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do it?"
Leslie Knope,Can you do it?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I can do it."
April Ludgate,God.
Leslie Knope,"I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent."
Leslie Knope,"I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty."
Leslie Knope,"I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant."""
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.
Brett,"Let's make it happen, Captain."
Harris,Don't call me that.
Leslie Knope,"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!"
Jerry Gergich,Holy cow! Leslie!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look how much it's bleeding."
Leslie Knope,Everybody look at it.
Leslie Knope,Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this.
Jerry Gergich,That's a lot of blood.
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's so--"
Donna Meagle,It's ketchup!
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,It's ketchup.
TV,Sentry duty is usually approximately one hour long.
TV,Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until about one month old.
April Ludgate,Do you know them?
Evelyn Rowshlind,What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it."
Leslie Knope,Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
Evelyn Rowshlind,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Evelyn Rowshlind,He's not a monster.
Evelyn Rowshlind,He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.
Leslie Knope,Ew!
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, where is the possum?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out."
Leslie Knope,"And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me."
Leslie Knope,"But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go."
Leslie Knope,This is interesting.
Leslie Knope,They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid."
Leslie Knope,But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.
Tom Haverford,That's great.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's awful, Tom."
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
April Ludgate,"Tom! It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose! Okay? I need your help!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! It's chewing on everything! Don't tell Leslie."
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,The possum got loose at Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department."
April Ludgate,"Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! How did this happen?"
April Ludgate,"I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in."
April Ludgate,"He did that, too."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna fix this.
Leslie Knope,Let me just think for a second.
April Ludgate,Uh-oh.
Leslie Knope,What?
April Ludgate,Where is it?
April Ludgate,I can't see it!
Leslie Knope,"No! Okay, where did it go?"
April Ludgate,I don't know! I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Here's what we do, we just go outside."
Leslie Knope,All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here!
Ron Swanson,I haven't even started yet.
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thought you could use some help.
Mark Brendanawicz,Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, shut up."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Would you, please?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm taking a half day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up."
Ron Swanson,"No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code."
Ron Swanson,And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code--
Mark Brendanawicz,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,"I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,I know!
Leslie Knope,What if it's in here?
April Ludgate,What if it laid eggs in the bed?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there, there are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it."
Leslie Knope,It's so huge.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call Andy.
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He tackled it once before, he can do it again."
April Ludgate,"No, please don't, okay? He's gonna be pissed at me."
April Ludgate,"I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with."
April Ludgate,"I just-- I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,He'll forgive you.
April Ludgate,You think so?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to call Andy.
Leslie Knope,We can just call Animal Control.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"And, April, any time you want to talk about boys--"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! Stop!"
Andy Dwyer,Yo.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I feel like you were mad at me yesterday and I don't know why."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I made a list of everything I did and I'm gonna try not to do any of them again."
Andy Dwyer,"Also, I got you this coffee."
Andy Dwyer,And then there's this.
Andy Dwyer,Fourth paragraph down.
Andy Dwyer,"""But Dwyer had some help catching the possum."""
April Ludgate,"""'I wouldn't have been able to do it without an early-morning caffeine boost from the amazing April Ludgate."""
April Ludgate,"""She gave me the liquid courage I needed to wrestle that beast to the ground."""
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, Miss Knope."
Evelyn Rowshlind,I have to say I'm very disappointed.
Leslie Knope,"You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"What did you do with the possum, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it."
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Honestly.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look."
Leslie Knope,"When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum."
Leslie Knope,"And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!"
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
April Ludgate,Sure.
Ann Perkins,It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house.
April Ludgate,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"So, did the neighbors give you any problems?"
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins,Anything in--
Leslie Knope,Possum.
