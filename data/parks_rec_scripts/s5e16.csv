Donna Meagle,I like it.

Ben Wyatt,Does that mean
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, yeah she's my sister."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"My twin sister, from the same mister."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank you so much for hiring MonaLisa.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It means so much to me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Even though, honestly, she's The wooorst."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She is the worst person in the world.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Huge skank.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Terrible.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,But thank you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It means a lot.
Tom Haverford,Of course.
Tom Haverford,Got to keep it in the family.

Mona-Lisa Saperstein,And I already committed to that.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,How are you?
Dennis Lerpiss,Hello.
Dennis Lerpiss,Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.
Dennis Lerpiss,Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.
Dennis Lerpiss,It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.
Leslie Knope,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie."
Leslie Knope,One that's a little bit more upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Like Finding Nemo or
Dennis Lerpiss,"I could do, uh, Shoah."
Leslie Knope,"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee Videodome.
Leslie Knope,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.
Leslie Knope,This is a Pawnee institution.
Leslie Knope,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd."
Perd Hapley,"It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable."
Perd Hapley,Which is why I give E.T. 1 and a 1/2 stars.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's over."
Leslie Knope,"Get up, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,What's everybody where are we?
Dennis Lerpiss,The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors."
Dennis Lerpiss,Forever.
Leslie Knope,No!
Dennis Lerpiss,"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, will you rent something?"
Morris,Why would I do that?
Morris,All movies are online for free.
Morris,I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you're not helping."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo."
Dennis Lerpiss,"Ooh, we don't carry cartoons."
Dennis Lerpiss,"But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry."
Dennis Lerpiss,It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.
Dennis Lerpiss,And it's it's nauseating.
Leslie Knope,I'll just buy some red vines.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, seriously, where are we?"
Chris Traeger,All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, that's how it works."
Ben Wyatt,How are you feeling?
Ben Wyatt,Did you make your dadcision yet?
Chris Traeger,I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby."
Chris Traeger,It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.
Tom Haverford,There's 60 dollars missing from the register.
Tom Haverford,I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, it is absolutely MonaLisa."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's a total klepto.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And nympho and pyro all those things.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately."
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.
Tom Haverford,I don't have time to find someone new.
Tom Haverford,This sucks.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid."
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I heard ""sack of flour"" and ""high school."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because if true, this guy wants in."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in."
Ann Perkins,"Actually, you know what?"
Ann Perkins,Don't tell him that I called.
Ann Perkins,"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?"
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?"
Ann Perkins,This is Jerry Gergich calling.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
April Ludgate,I have to tell you a secret.
April Ludgate,"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe."
Ann Perkins,"Good morning, April."
Ann Perkins,What's your secret?
April Ludgate,I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, April, that's great!"
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Ann Perkins,Where'd you get that?
April Ludgate,The Internet.
April Ludgate,So I really need a letter of recommendation.
April Ludgate,"And since you work in a hospital, as a janitor"
Ann Perkins,Nurse.
April Ludgate,I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand."
Ann Perkins,And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.
Ann Perkins,But now I have the upper hand.
Ann Perkins,And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.
Ann Perkins,I would be happy to write you that letter.
Ann Perkins,I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.
April Ludgate,Because you hooked up with him?
Ann Perkins,I don't hook up with everyone I know.
Ann Perkins,"Although, yes, we did hook up."
Ann Perkins,"But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say."
April Ludgate,So I have to be your slave or something?
Ann Perkins,"No, you have to be my friend."
April Ludgate,"No, that is so much worse."
Ann Perkins,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.
Leslie Knope,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat."
Ron Swanson,That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market."
Leslie Knope,But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.
Leslie Knope,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.
Leslie Knope,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.
Leslie Knope,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Ron Swanson,This man is a failure.
Ron Swanson,He is not up to snuff.
Ron Swanson,"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out."
Ron Swanson,"This is a bailout, and I don't like it."
Ron Swanson,And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.
Leslie Knope,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So use your money wisely.
Leslie Knope,Get popular films that people wanna see.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies with the subtitles."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Like Pixar.
Leslie Knope,Reese Witherspoon.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay."
Dennis Lerpiss,What?
Dennis Lerpiss,"No, no."
Dennis Lerpiss,No.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about."
Tom Haverford,Do we need to sit like this?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.
Chris Traeger,And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's not that."
Tom Haverford,She scares the crap out of me.
Tom Haverford,I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.
Chris Traeger,"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected."""
Chris Traeger,You're Tom Haverford.
Chris Traeger,"You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly."
Chris Traeger,Stand up for yourself.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party."
Tom Haverford,"And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks for the advice, man."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,Son.
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,And my second Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest."
Andy Dwyer,"And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded."
Andy Dwyer,And hornets came out.
Leslie Knope,Andy
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest."
Leslie Knope,"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons."
Leslie Knope,Any other comments here before we Ron?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing at a city council meeting?
Leslie Knope,Are you lost?
Leslie Knope,Are you hurt?
Ron Swanson,"No, I am here to express an opinion."
Ron Swanson,This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.
Ron Swanson,"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape."
Ron Swanson,Allow me to elaborate.
Ron Swanson,The government should not prop up a failed business.
Ron Swanson,That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.
Leslie Knope,Please stop talking about wounded meat.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.
Leslie Knope,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.
Ron Swanson,You rented Rashomon?
Ron Swanson,What was your favorite part of that?
Leslie Knope,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet."
Leslie Knope,But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.
Morris,"Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want."
Leslie Knope,Bailiff!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one."
Leslie Knope,"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Extra,How much to rent this jacket?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You should just take it.
Tom Haverford,"It's 15 for the day, 40 for the week. Thank you."
Tom Haverford,We appreciate your business.
Tom Haverford,MonaLisa!
Tom Haverford,Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Did I order the what for the what what what, what?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What are you even talking about right now?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes forever to leave my system"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,We're doing this now.
Tom Haverford,You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Or else what?
Tom Haverford,Or else I'll fire you.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What did you just say?
Tom Haverford,"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you."
Tom Haverford,Do you understand?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor."
Ann Perkins,What about you?
Ann Perkins,Build your perfect guy.
April Ludgate,"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback."
April Ludgate,Do you like my nails?
Ann Perkins,"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me."
Ann Perkins,I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.
Extra,"Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware."
Extra,Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?
Leslie Knope,We're not bailing anyone out.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.
Extra,We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.
Extra,And people need places to buy tools.
Morris,"Uh, you can just buy tools online."
Leslie Knope,"Bailiff, why is he back in here?"
Leslie Knope,How did you get back in here?
Morris,I'll see myself out.
Morris,Don't worry about it.
Joe From Sewage,I heard you were giving out free money.
Joe From Sewage,"I need $3,000."
Joe From Sewage,Minimum.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan."
Joe From Sewage,"What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got 3,000 dollars?"
Leslie Knope,I'd call the police.
Joe From Sewage,You cannot call the police.
Extra,"Wilson Gromling of the ""Liberty or Die"" party."
Extra,These government handouts are deplorable.
Extra,You're just handing out blank checks.
Extra,I was on food stamps.
Extra,I was on Welfare.
Extra,And nobody ever helped me.
Leslie Knope,This is not a blank check.
Leslie Knope,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.
Leslie Knope,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen."
Leslie Knope,"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved."
Councilman Howser,Are there any other comments?
Extra,Yes.
Extra,"The Pawnee chapter of the ""Liberty or Die"" party has hit some hard times."
Extra,We were wondering if maybe the town could loan us some money.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, how did it go with MonaLisa?"
Tom Haverford,"I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that is very responsible and mature."
Ben Wyatt,She took it well?
Tom Haverford,Um yeah.
Tom Haverford,"For some reason, she got super turned on."
Tom Haverford,We started making out.
Tom Haverford,Hard.
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex."
Tom Haverford,We're together now.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee."
Tom Haverford,Here you go.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'd still hit it.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm coolin' on you.
Tom Haverford,See?
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you have to choose one."
April Ludgate,I can't think.
April Ludgate,These braids you did are making my brain hurt.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Miranda.
Ann Perkins,"No, I think you're a Charlotte."
Ann Perkins,You're like a scary Charlotte.
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you."
Ann Perkins,What's what's up?
Chris Traeger,Nothin'.
April Ludgate,This is weird.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's not."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it is."
April Ludgate,Why is it weird?
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to talk in private?
April Ludgate,"No, anything you can say to Ann, you can say to me because we're best friends this week."
Chris Traeger,Can we talk later?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
April Ludgate,Why don't you talk now?
Ann Perkins,"No, talk to you later."
April Ludgate,"Chris, we can talk now."
April Ludgate,"What's going on, best friend?"
Ann Perkins,"Nothing, never mind."
April Ludgate,Tell me.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's happening.
Ann Perkins,Back to forced friendship.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, let's go put on our pj's and make White Russians."
Ann Perkins,So fun.
Ron Swanson,Councilwoman.
Ron Swanson,"I just came down to see the effects of your government intervention, and I've got to hand it to you You really turned this place around."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis."
Dennis Lerpiss,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You did it!
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,I did it.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it was."
Dennis Lerpiss,I took your advice.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us."
Dennis Lerpiss,"Give the people what they want, right?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't what people want.
Andy Dwyer,It's definitely what that guy wants.
Herman,I like this store now.
Leslie Knope,Do you realize what you have done?
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.
Leslie Knope,You have made us porn peddlers!
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx."
Brandi Maxxxx,Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Everyone stop applauding.
Leslie Knope,"For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, you've always been a huge supporter of my work."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I haven't."
Brandi Maxxxx,So I'm thrilled to tell you that I'm playing Leslie Knope in the porn version of the story of this government bailout!
Leslie Knope,Please don't do that.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Oh, we already filmed it."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Brandi Maxxxx,The porn industry in town was really faltering.
Brandi Maxxxx,But now we're back.
Brandi Maxxxx,You're our hero!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Are you ready?
April Ludgate,For you to tell me what's going on with Chris?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,To sing.
Ann Perkins,"If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time go."
April Ludgate,"No, tell me about Chris."
Ann Perkins,"If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waitin'"
April Ludgate,"Tell me about Chris, or I'm leaving, and I don't care about the letter."
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and I asked Chris to donate his sperm."
Ann Perkins,"And he's taking a really long time to make up his mind, and it's really freaking me out."
Ann Perkins,"And I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm obsessing about it, and I want to think about anything else but that, but it's making me crazy."
April Ludgate,Secrets stolen from deep inside.
Ann Perkins,You know this song already?
April Ludgate,Of course I do.
April Ludgate,Everyone knows this song.
April Ludgate,It's amazing.
April Ludgate,The drum beats out of time
Ann Perkins,"if you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you time after time time after time time after time."
April Ludgate,"if you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you time after time time after time time after time."
Donna Meagle,"oh, I'll be waiting"
April Ludgate,This never happened.
Chris Traeger,I made everything worse.
Chris Traeger,"If Tom were a bag of flour, that flour would never grow up to be a happy, welladjusted loaf of bread."
Chris Traeger,"Much less a bran muffin, which is the highest honor that flour can achieve."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you're really gonna say no to Ann?"
Chris Traeger,"I care about Ann very deeply, but I just don't know if I'm cut out to be a dad."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, every parent makes mistakes."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, lord knows I've made plenty."
Jerry Gergich,But it's the small victories that keep you going.
Jerry Gergich,"When you see your little one take her first step oror graduate college, oh, my God, it just makes it all worth it."
Jerry Gergich,"And another thing is if If, like If I You know, and then your kid's because you're like vrrrr I don't know."
Jerry Gergich,"And everyone's like, ""Oh."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I'm sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,I no one ever lets me talk this long.
Jerry Gergich,I just got lost.
Jerry Gergich,It was a beautiful point.
Chris Traeger,"And very well said, right up until that moment that you started babbling incoherently."
Ron Swanson,And I'll have the number eight.
Extra,That's a party platter.
Extra,It serves 12 people.
Ron Swanson,"I know what I'm about, son."
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Let me have it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, I'll do it for you."
Leslie Knope,"I told you so, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is what happens when the government interferes with business.
Leslie Knope,"Government is bad, business is good."
Leslie Knope,Free market.
Ron Swanson,"Capitalism is the only way, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,It moves our country forward.
Ron Swanson,It's what makes America great.
Ron Swanson,And England okay and France terrible.
Leslie Knope,I like capitalism.
Leslie Knope,I love competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm more competitive than you.
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Ron Swanson,Settle down.
Leslie Knope,"No, settle up."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won."
Leslie Knope,"Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money."
Ron Swanson,There is not.
Ron Swanson,The free market is a jungle.
Ron Swanson,It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.
Ron Swanson,"When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place."
Ron Swanson,Just let business be business and government be government.
Extra,Here you go.
Extra,And one number eight.
Ron Swanson,"All right, party time."
Leslie Knope,"I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing."
Ron Swanson,These will not be necessary.
Ann Perkins,"Here is your letter of recommendation, so you're off the hook."
Ann Perkins,No need to pretend to be my friend anymore.
April Ludgate,Thank God.
Ann Perkins,"I can't tell if you actually hate me or if this is just how you are, but I had fun hanging out with you."
Ann Perkins,"So I don't care what you say, you're my friend."
Ann Perkins,"And I hope you get into veterinary school because I like you, so there."
April Ludgate,I got you something too.
Ann Perkins,A baby-naming book.
April Ludgate,I hope it works out with Chris.
April Ludgate,"And if it doesn't, I hope it works out with someone."
Ann Perkins,We're gonna hug now.
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Ow! You're hurting me!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm! Lot of hot ""D"" in here tonight."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ooh, look at that chunky hunky."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Go over there and talk to him and find out what his deal is.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not gonna talk to some other guy."
Tom Haverford,"When we're together, you can't check out other guys."
Tom Haverford,That's the deal.
Tom Haverford,"Or else it's over between us, you understand?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mm! Tommy laying down the law.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,A little feisty.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I like that, okay? I'ma go get a soda."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Do you want to have sex somewhere after I do that?
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,All right.
Chris Traeger,Well.
Chris Traeger,Looks like things with Mona-Lisa are Continuing.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm gradually transforming her from truly terrible to only kinda terrible.
Tom Haverford,"It's the small victories, you know?"
Chris Traeger,Indeed.
Chris Traeger,The small victories.
Tom Haverford,"I know she's kind of a monster, but whatever."
Tom Haverford,I'm young.
Tom Haverford,She's sexy.
Tom Haverford,I'm just gonna see where this roller coaster goes.
Chris Traeger,Fair enough.
Chris Traeger,Is there anything else you need help with? Have you learned how to ride a bike yet?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I'm 28 years old.
Chris Traeger,"I'm proud of you, bud."
Tom Haverford,Thanks!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"Is that a happy ""Ann Perkins,"" or is that a bad-news ""Ann Perkins""?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, happy."
Chris Traeger,Obviously.
Chris Traeger,The bad news one sounds like this.
Chris Traeger,"""Ann Perkins."""
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I've thought about it."
Chris Traeger,And I'm in.
Chris Traeger,I want to be a parent.
Chris Traeger,"I want to raise a child, with all the ups and downs and challenges that comes with it."
Ann Perkins,"Chris, this is so great."
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy.
Chris Traeger,Me too.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I guess your uter-you and my uter-me are now our uter-us."
Ann Perkins,Don't make me change my mind.
Leslie Knope,"Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center."
Leslie Knope,There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss.
Leslie Knope,Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Brandi Maxxxx,"I'm glad you're here, Dong Swanson."
Brandi Maxxxx,The local video store's about to go under.
Brandi Maxxxx,We have to save it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the wrong movie."
