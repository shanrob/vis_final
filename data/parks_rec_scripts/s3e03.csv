Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule?"
Jerry Gergich,These are my mother's diaries.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, she lived in Pawnee all of her life and recorded everything she ever did."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, so it's, you know, kind of like a living document about the town."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,A disappointingly good idea from Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Better than good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
April Ludgate,Give me that.
April Ludgate,"""January 18, 1964."""
April Ludgate,"""Jerrold starred in his school production of Peter Pan."""
April Ludgate,"""He was a beautiful Tinker Bell."""
Jerry Gergich,It was an all boys school.
Eduardo,Jerry!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie, I have an idea."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't we put Eduardo in there and seal the top so that he suffocates and dies?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, you're up."
Tom Haverford,"For my item, I chose a picture of my exgirlfriend Lucy with a mustache drawn on her face and stink lines coming off her, 'cause she stinks."
Tom Haverford,She broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,Didn't really tell me why.
Tom Haverford,"Luckily, when you're the guy, you can just tell people she's crazy."
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up."""
Tom Haverford,"""Yeah, man."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turns out she's crazy."""
Tom Haverford,That's what they always do on Entourage.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,"I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, JJ's diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, The Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkcalypse."
Ron Swanson,"Wendy loves it, too."
Leslie Knope,And I am submitting this.
Leslie Knope,A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Leslie Knope,"Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Can you believe it?
April Ludgate,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Paris of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Akron of Southwest Indiana."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, German soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The factory fire capital of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Engage with Zorp."""
Leslie Knope,"For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult."
Leslie Knope,Zorp is dead.
Leslie Knope,Long live Zorp.
Leslie Knope,It's safe to be here now.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Birthplace of Julia Roberts."""
Leslie Knope,"That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, Taliban soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"And finally, our current slogan."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""First in friendship, fourth in obesity."""
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule."
Leslie Knope,And you can quote me on that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article."
Leslie Knope,I thought of a great headline.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Leslie Knope,"""It's Time to Encapsulate the Future."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Good one.
Leslie Knope,"Sub headline, ""The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, this guy's here."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Can I help you?
Kelly Larson,I'm Kelly Larson.
Kelly Larson,"I read online about your time capsule, and I'm here to make a suggestion."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,We're not taking Twilight books.
Kelly Larson,"It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance."
Leslie Knope,You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
Leslie Knope,I thought you would be younger.
Leslie Knope,And a girl.
Kelly Larson,"Well, I'm not."
Kelly Larson,I'm older and a boy.
Kelly Larson,But I feel very strongly that these should be included.
Kelly Larson,Can I tell you why?
Leslie Knope,"Sure, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Kelly Larson,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,And plead your case.
Kelly Larson,Thanks.
Kelly Larson,"Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973."
Kelly Larson,"Author Stephenie Meyer, nee Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're going all the way back to her birth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important."
Chris Traeger,That's so true.
Andy Dwyer,"But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen."
Andy Dwyer,Present company excluded.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,I was talking about me.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we did."
Ann Perkins,Thank you for catching him up on our history.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine."
Chris Traeger,I can literally see my face in my shoes.
Chris Traeger,See you later!
Andy Dwyer,He didn't-- He didn't pay me.
Ann Perkins,Why are you hanging out with Chris?
Andy Dwyer,He just sat down.
Andy Dwyer,What am I supposed to do?
Andy Dwyer,He's my boss.
Ann Perkins,"No, he's not."
Andy Dwyer,He isn't?
Andy Dwyer,God dang it.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot figure out who my boss is.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I like this guy."
Ann Perkins,"Please don't do anything weird, I beg you."
Ann Perkins,"I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up."
Ann Perkins,Andy screws everything up.
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot."
Kelly Larson,"And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide."
Kelly Larson,"Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I have not."
Kelly Larson,"Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot."
Kelly Larson,Movie number one.
Kelly Larson,Twilight.
Kelly Larson,We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystal clear water.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like."
Leslie Knope,"It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee."
Kelly Larson,"I disagree, okay?"
Kelly Larson,"The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I have to say no.
Kelly Larson,I beg you to reconsider.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Kelly Larson,Then I'm gonna have to do this.
Leslie Knope,He brought handcuffs with him.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing was planned.
April Ludgate,I think it's kind of cool.
Leslie Knope,It's not cool.
Leslie Knope,"It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules."
Leslie Knope,Cool people make the rules.
Leslie Knope,They don't break the rules.
Leslie Knope,"And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends."
April Ludgate,"Whoa, who are you even talking about?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just annoyed.
Leslie Knope,"But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?"
Leslie Knope,He concerns me.
April Ludgate,He's a genius.
Ron Swanson,I'll take care of this trespasser.
Ron Swanson,Give me 30 seconds.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna call security.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, can we push the meeting an hour?"
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Ben Wyatt,Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,Again?
Kelly Larson,You look sad.
Tom Haverford,You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.
Kelly Larson,"It's a girl, isn't it?"
Kelly Larson,I can tell.
Kelly Larson,It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah?"
Tom Haverford,Is it?
Tom Haverford,What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure?
Kelly Larson,"Okay, I'll be quiet."
Kelly Larson,But I do know something about heartbreak.
Kelly Larson,And you know who else does?
Tom Haverford,"Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds?"
Kelly Larson,No.
Kelly Larson,A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.
Donna Meagle,Trust me.
Donna Meagle,You should listen to him.
Donna Meagle,Those books are good.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or time traveling romances."
Donna Meagle,"And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee."
Donna Meagle,I'll tell you that much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, buddy, time is up."
Leslie Knope,Give us the keys.
Kelly Larson,They're hidden somewhere very far away.
Leslie Knope,Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Kelly Larson,Why?
Kelly Larson,I'm not doing anything wrong.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are."
Ron Swanson,You're trespassing.
Kelly Larson,"Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,You're trespassing.
Kelly Larson,"Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule."
Kelly Larson,This muscleheaded Stormtrooper doesn't scare me.
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Artie."
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Please!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Get him away from me!
Kelly Larson,I am very scared of you!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there."
Leslie Knope,"In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to-- He brought a pillow."
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea."
Kelly Larson,Do you want any?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, dude, wake up, man."
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Twilight is dope.
Kelly Larson,I told you.
Tom Haverford,I couldn't put it down.
Tom Haverford,It was like she was peering into my soul.
Kelly Larson,"Sing it, friend."
Kelly Larson,Here.
Kelly Larson,Book two.
Kelly Larson,Twilight: New Moon.
Kelly Larson,Get cracking.
Tom Haverford,There's a second book?
Kelly Larson,And a third and a fourth.
Tom Haverford,No way.
Chris Traeger,It's fantastic.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I worked really hard.
Andy Dwyer,I did every pair that I could.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know what to do with these.
Andy Dwyer,I think they're gloves.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Those are sports sandals.
Chris Traeger,They are for adventure racing.
Chris Traeger,"They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk."
Chris Traeger,"So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right?"
Andy Dwyer,You got all of that from a picture?
Chris Traeger,"No, you told me yesterday."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want to help you win her over."
Chris Traeger,Why do I want to help him?
Chris Traeger,Because he's a good person.
Chris Traeger,I love good people.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know who should wear these shoes?"
Andy Dwyer,Monkeys.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, this is an interesting turn of events."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting."
Leslie Knope,"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, how's this for a headline?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams."""
Leslie Knope,"God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story."
Chris Traeger,"The key to April's heart is within you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.
Chris Traeger,What's great about you?
Andy Dwyer,I'm nice.
Chris Traeger,Good!
Chris Traeger,Nice.
Chris Traeger,What else?
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.
Chris Traeger,Band!
Chris Traeger,What else?
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Tom Haverford,Am I team Edward?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though?"
Tom Haverford,Absolutely not.
Kelly Larson,"Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection."
Leslie Knope,"Can you please, please be quiet?"
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,Let's keep it down.
Kelly Larson,Be considerate.
Kelly Larson,"Look at it this way, Tom."
Kelly Larson,Bella's love for Edward is being tested.
Tom Haverford,By Jacob?
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Not exactly.
Tom Haverford,The Volturi?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst."
Kelly Larson,"You seem tense, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?
Kelly Larson,Read Twilight.
Kelly Larson,Here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks."
Tom Haverford,Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly."
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,"Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe."
Kelly Larson,It's a little more comfortable.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?
Leslie Knope,Sleep well?
Kelly Larson,"It was all right, considering."
Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.
Kelly Larson,Thank you so much.
Kelly Larson,"Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning."
Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?
Kelly Larson,"Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though."
Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
Kelly Larson,What?
Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this."
Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle."
Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?"
Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?
Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?
Kelly Larson,"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her."
Kelly Larson,She loves Twilight.
Kelly Larson,"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero."
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
Kelly Larson,I didn't want to drag her into it.
Kelly Larson,I'm sorry.
Kelly Larson,This is a mistake.
Kelly Larson,You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no."
Ron Swanson,We don't negotiate with weirdoes.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board."
Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point."
Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Ben Wyatt,What does that mean?
Ron Swanson,Crackpot convention.
Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule."
Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Extra,I think we should put in the Bible.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Eduardo.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Eduardo."
Andy Dwyer,I want to apologize.
Andy Dwyer,Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.
Andy Dwyer,"I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you."
Eduardo,Thank you for saying that.
Andy Dwyer,You're welcome.
Eduardo,What CDs are those?
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,My band.
Andy Dwyer,It's our latest album.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You like music?
Andy Dwyer,What are you listening to?
Eduardo,The Smiths.
Eduardo,Very depressing!
Andy Dwyer,April's making you listen to that?
Eduardo,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,She's really into that indie stuff.
Andy Dwyer,I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.
Eduardo,David Matthews!
Eduardo,Crash into Me!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,I love that song.
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, here."
Andy Dwyer,Take one.
Andy Dwyer,Check us out.
Andy Dwyer,"We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us."
Eduardo,"Yeah, gracias."
Andy Dwyer,"That means ""thank you""?"
Eduardo,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.
Marcia Langman,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Marcia Langman,"I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation."
Marcia Langman,This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.
Marcia Langman,There are girls quivering.
Marcia Langman,"There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth."
Marcia Langman,There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.
Marcia Langman,"It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it."
Extra,I totally disagree.
Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight."
Extra,Absolutely not.
Extra,I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.
Extra,"That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project."
Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?"
Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?"
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,You promised!
Marcia Langman,You promised?
Marcia Langman,That's not fair!
Extra,"Wait, it's not a question of fairness."
Marcia Langman,"Go back to Russia, commie!"
Kelly Larson,"Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from!"
Marcia Langman,Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia. Can I just say that?
Leslie Knope,And who else?
Extra,"I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight."
Extra,I don't care about Twilight.
Extra,Why is this only about his favorite book? I want my favorite book in there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,Two time capsules.
Leslie Knope,"One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight."
Marcia Langman,No Twilight!
Kelly Larson,"Yes, Twilight!"
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Lucy,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming.
Lucy,I only have a second.
Lucy,I have to get to work.
Tom Haverford,Bella's going on her first hunt.
Tom Haverford,I just don't get why you broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,"Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward Bella Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?"
Lucy,Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight. It just didn't work out.
Tom Haverford,"Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron."
Lucy,"Actually, that's the reason."
Lucy,"I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron."
Lucy,You talk about it constantly.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss."
Tom Haverford,"Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend."
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?
Lucy,"Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass."
Lucy,"Look, Tom, I like you."
Lucy,"You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around."
Lucy,"So if you ever work through this, then give me a call."
Extra,"My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule."
Chance Frenlm,"My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule."
Leslie Knope,"For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules."
Chance Frenlm,Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip!
Leslie Knope,No chanting.
Extra,"Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years."
Extra,We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.
Leslie Knope,So what's your suggestion?
Extra,I don't know. I'm just scared.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Eduardo,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever."
Andy Dwyer,"We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours."
Andy Dwyer,Is that cool?
Eduardo,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Gretel,That's ridiculous.
Gretel,"Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think pet paintings/ ashes are in time capsule four."
Extra,"No, that's baseball cards."
Leslie Knope,"No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia."
Kelly Larson,"Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories."
Extra,"Oh, shut up, Kelly!"
Kelly Larson,"Make me, Bob!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
Leslie Knope,You're leaving soon.
Leslie Knope,Can I blame it on you in the press?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive."
Ben Wyatt,I've been to a lot of towns.
Ben Wyatt,Usually people don't care about anything.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, don't get me wrong."
Ben Wyatt,"These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now."
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Pawnee of the future, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope,"""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago."""
Leslie Knope,"""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent what life was like in our town at that moment."""
Leslie Knope,"""Instead, you'll find only one item, a video recording of a public forum we held in order to determine just what those items would be."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is truly what life was like."""
Leslie Knope,"""A lot of people with a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in."""
Leslie Knope,"""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity."""
Leslie Knope,"""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle."""
Leslie Knope,"""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow."""
Leslie Knope,"""He had one job to do."""
Leslie Knope,"""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past."""
Andy Dwyer,Is Eduardo coming?
April Ludgate,"No, he went back to Venezuela."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks."
Andy Dwyer,He was a really good bassist.
Andy Dwyer,I was actually starting to like him.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,That's what made me start to hate him.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Nice and band totally worked.
Ann Perkins,Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, he's great."
Chris Traeger,And he told me how great you are.
Chris Traeger,And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.
Ann Perkins,"He did, huh?"
Chris Traeger,He did.
Chris Traeger,"And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had."
Chris Traeger,Would you like one?
Ann Perkins,Absolutely.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Everyone,"Hey, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ooh! Hey.
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up."
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what did I just say?"
Kelly Larson,"Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to--"
Tom Haverford,How about you shut up?
