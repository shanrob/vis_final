Ben Wyatt,"Aw, babe, you've gone crazy."
Leslie Knope,"The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.
Leslie Knope,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.
Leslie Knope,What do you think should be higher priority?
Leslie Knope,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?
Ben Wyatt,Is this really necessary?
Leslie Knope,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind."
Ben Wyatt,"I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, babe, you can'tâ¦ you would just embarrass yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, let's do that instead."
Leslie Knope,"See, that's what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay, let's do this."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,On to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.
Leslie Knope,"April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds."
Ron Swanson,I would like to volunteer to do the park survey myself.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.
Leslie Knope,Today is that historic day.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,That is what has happened.
Ron Swanson,Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.
Ron Swanson,"I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss."
Ron Swanson,"Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins."
Ron Swanson,There is no quiet anymore.
Ron Swanson,There is only Doc McStuffins.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?"
Ron Swanson,I really don't need--
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,I call shotgun.
Andy Dwyer,Where are we going?
Andy Dwyer,Doesn't matter.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun on all rides for the rest of the day.
Andy Dwyer,For the rest of my life.
Andy Dwyer,In any car!
Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!
Andy Dwyer,I just faced you suckers!
Andy Dwyer,"So I'll see you in the parking lot, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Later!
Tom Haverford,Is the tent guy lefthanded or righthanded?
Tom Haverford,I just need to know which way to part my hair to get us a better price.
Tom Haverford,It's a business theory I'm working on.
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it matters.
Ben Wyatt,Pretty straightforward deal.
Tom Haverford,A straightforward deal?
Tom Haverford,Why didn't you tell me?
Tom Haverford,I don't have my straightforward deal fedora on me.
Tom Haverford,We gotta stop by my storage unit on the way up.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanna come with us to tent world?"
Ben Wyatt,Little road trip?
Jerry Gergich,Tent world?
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, let me grab my lunch."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Why'd you invite Larry?
Ben Wyatt,He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.
Ben Wyatt,He deserves to come.
Tom Haverford,Remember you said that when Larry's farting up the car.
Ben Wyatt,Larry isn't that bad.
Ben Wyatt,He's nice.
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, I don't care who knows that I said that, as long as no one knows that I said that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann."
Leslie Knope,I brought some fresh snacks.
Leslie Knope,"And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good."
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Ann called while you were in the bathroom."
Donna Meagle,"She said something came up, she'll call you later."
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"God, why'd you let me say all that?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!"
Leslie Knope,I'm coming!
Ann Perkins,Listen to me very carefully.
Ann Perkins,I have not been taken.
Ann Perkins,"I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what they'd make you say.
Ann Perkins,"Also, no one's making me say this."
Ann Perkins,"I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business."
Ann Perkins,I just have to run.
Ann Perkins,Something came up.
Ann Perkins,"I love you, and I'll call you later."
Leslie Knope,Donna.
Leslie Knope,"What's good, baby?"
Leslie Knope,What's going down in Donna town?
Leslie Knope,What's the haps in Meaglewood?
Donna Meagle,I'm listening to Jaleel Or No Deal.
Donna Meagle,It's a podcast where the kid who played Urkel reviews old Deal Or No Deal episodes.
Donna Meagle,"It's pointless, and I love it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't let me interrupt."
Leslie Knope,"April, what's the 411, little mama?"
Leslie Knope,What's the hot goss?
Leslie Knope,Who you crushing on these days?
April Ludgate,"Ew, my husband, weirdo."
April Ludgate,Can I get back to work now?
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Work?
Leslie Knope,You can work whenever.
Leslie Knope,"Except for now, because now is lady time."
April Ludgate,You sound like a tampon commercial.
Leslie Knope,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.
April Ludgate,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that she-beast moved away."
April Ludgate,I believe her name was Satan?
Leslie Knope,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, up front."
Leslie Knope,"I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch."
Leslie Knope,It will be a women's only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,"Side note, do not Google that phrase."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Can I ask you kind of an important question?
Andy Dwyer,"You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It's robots.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,I do have a serious question.
Andy Dwyer,"In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more-- Ow!"
Andy Dwyer,That sucks.
Ron Swanson,Are you hurt?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,All good.
Andy Dwyer,All good.
Andy Dwyer,Oops.
Andy Dwyer,Except for my mouth.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, whoa."
Andy Dwyer,Five second rule.
Andy Dwyer,"No, ahh."
Ron Swanson,"Come on, we better get you to a dentist."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Larry."
Tom Haverford,Your tuna fish sandwich stunk up my suit.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle made it for me.
Tom Haverford,Irrelevant.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,Stay out here and double-check these deal memos.
Tom Haverford,"If you get through 'em, triple-check 'em."
Tom Haverford,Just don't come inside.
Jerry Gergich,Sounds good.
Jerry Gergich,I will finish my sandwich and enjoy the view.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,We spoke on the phone.
Harvey,Yeah.
Harvey,"Yeah, we sure did."
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,Who's this little genie right here?
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison."
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,Got your contracts for you right here.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,It's a lot thicker than the original one page version.
Harvey,"I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy."
Harvey,"I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone."
Harvey,"900 of those are over 2,000 square feet, 80 of them are striped, and exactly 4 of 'em were once rented by Miss Rene Russo."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Harvey,Yeah.
Harvey,No doy.
Harvey,I think I know what I'm doing.
Harvey,So I added a few syllables and whatnot.
Harvey,"Clauses, et cetera."
Harvey,"Addendums, what have you."
Harvey,Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it."
Leslie Knope,You're so tan.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, thanks."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife."
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Evelyn,I love Rome.
Evelyn,It's such a great place.
Donna Meagle,Rome's played out.
Donna Meagle,Have y'all been to Kuala Lumpur?
Leslie Knope,When did you go to Asia?
Donna Meagle,I go all the time.
Donna Meagle,Where do you think I got that crystal Buddha head above my jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,You have a jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,Prospects for new Pawnee best friend.
Leslie Knope,Donna Meagle.
Leslie Knope,"Confident, worldly, we go way back."
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate.
Leslie Knope,"Vivid imagination, young, and vibrant."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Pretty, fragile, makes terrible life decisions."
Leslie Knope,"A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her."
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,Bit of a dark horse.
Leslie Knope,"Crotchety, but probably wise."
Leslie Knope,"And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,I don't know her last name.
Leslie Knope,Honestly we just needed bodies.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday."
Leslie Knope,"Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled."
Leslie Knope,Just for fun.
Leslie Knope,Nothing serious.
Leslie Knope,But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
Leslie Knope,To girlfriends!
April Ludgate,Yay.
Donna Meagle,Girlfriends.
Leslie Knope,Whoohoo!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you pick first."
Donna Meagle,"""What is your favorite TV show?"""
Donna Meagle,"Well, for live tweeting, it's Scandal."
Donna Meagle,"For binge watching, it's Scandal."
Donna Meagle,"But for fashion, it's actually Scandal."
Donna Meagle,My answer is Scandal.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,"Ooh, I love watching Russian traffic accidents on YouTube while I play children's music at the wrong RPM."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I like beauty pageants.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Everyone is so happy and perfect.
Ethel Beavers,I like Diagnosis Murder.
Ethel Beavers,And skin flicks.
Ethel Beavers,Can anybody top me off?
Leslie Knope,The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.
Donna Meagle,The correct answer?
Leslie Knope,Next question.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this contract is insane."
Ben Wyatt,It costs extra to have people inside the tents?
Ben Wyatt,And what's a flap tax?
Harvey,"Well, you need flaps, bro."
Harvey,A tent without flaps is basically a parachute.
Tom Haverford,An unfolding charge?
Tom Haverford,A noise damage waiver?
Tom Haverford,How can noise damage tents?
Harvey,Shh.
Harvey,"Keep your voice down, please, there's tents here."
Harvey,"Now, look, you can argue with me all you want, but for every line item that you two idiots disagree with, there's gonna be a 50 dollar discussion surcharge."
Harvey,"What are we up to, doll?"
Extra,400 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,A discussion surcharge?
Ben Wyatt,That's nuts.
Harvey,450 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,That's it.
Ben Wyatt,Deal's off.
Ben Wyatt,We'll take our business elsewhere.
Harvey,"Suit yourself, gentlemen."
Harvey,Sorry we couldn't make a deal.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,Let me try one more thing.
Tom Haverford,What's the price now?
Harvey,80 dollars more.
Harvey,I liked it better the other way.
Tom Haverford,"Does have an effect, though."
Ron Swanson,The receptionist says she'll fit you in as soon as there's an opening.
Ron Swanson,"If you're all right, I'm gonna head back to the park."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, wait, wait, real quick, real quick."
Andy Dwyer,Do you know what my social security number is?
Andy Dwyer,Or if I'm allergic to anything?
Andy Dwyer,I don't like corn.
Andy Dwyer,Should I put that down?
Andy Dwyer,Or will that be confusing?
Andy Dwyer,Because I do like candy corn.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,What a mess.
Andy Dwyer,"Here, let me help you."
Ron Swanson,All I wanted was two hours where I got to forget that I was a parent.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, look."
Andy Dwyer,I found all three differences.
Ron Swanson,Those are two completely different pictures.
April Ludgate,"""Ladies' choice."""
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Wild card option.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all."
Donna Meagle,I've gotten two annulments.
Donna Meagle,"One for pleasure, and one to cap off a long con I was running against Keith Sweat."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel, have you --Okay, Ethel's asleep."
Leslie Knope,Shauna?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm writing a memoir based on my blog.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's called Tweeping Up Appearances, and it's about my journey to find happiness by smiling through the pain."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I can work with that."
Donna Meagle,"Knope, what you got going on in that notebook?"
Leslie Knope,Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.
April Ludgate,"""Friendship rankings."""
April Ludgate,What's that?
Leslie Knope,It's not what it sounds like.
Leslie Knope,It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.
Donna Meagle,That's messed up.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that is really lame, and I'm leaving."
Donna Meagle,"You're better than that, Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, why are you angry?"
Leslie Knope,You were in first place.
Evelyn,"Bye, everyone."
Evelyn,This was a really... brunch.
Leslie Knope,Leave the bag.
Ethel Beavers,"If you do this again next year, don't call me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, by default, it's Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?"
Leslie Knope,By default?
Tom Haverford,My pores are clogged up from being in that dusty warehouse.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna check if this gas station has some biore strips.
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, thanks, Larry, that's nice of you."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle always has me do the windshield.
Jerry Gergich,She likes to stand behind me and watch.
Jerry Gergich,"According to her, it's the best view."
Ben Wyatt,How is Gayle?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,And the girls?
Jerry Gergich,They're good.
Jerry Gergich,Why do you want to know?
Ben Wyatt,I'm genuinely interested.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I'm just not used to people from the office asking me things.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of scary.
Jerry Gergich,"But in a good way, though."
Tom Haverford,"Aw, man, did I miss a Larry fart?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, uh, we were just--"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I really ripped one."
Jerry Gergich,"Didn't I, Ben?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it was loud."
Tom Haverford,Smells like a hippopotamus took a dump on a skunk.
Jerry Gergich,It's in your best interest.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, the numbers don't lie."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm a goofus, not a gallant."
Andy Dwyer,Been here forever.
Andy Dwyer,Can we go?
Ron Swanson,Don't you want to get your tooth fixed?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I think my tooth looks fine just like this."
Ron Swanson,"Well, my grandmother was missing that tooth, and she was the most beautiful woman on her oil rig."
Ron Swanson,You are an adult.
Ron Swanson,I am not your dad.
Ron Swanson,"If you want to go, we can go."
Andy Dwyer,Yay.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"That's why you know even though you're not my dad, you're like an old brother to me."
Andy Dwyer,"Like a cool uncle, but old."
Andy Dwyer,Like a grandpa.
Andy Dwyer,But cool like a son.
Tom Haverford,Thank you very much.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Extra,No problem.
Extra,"That'll be $8, please."
Ben Wyatt,"What, you're charging us for coffee?"
Ben Wyatt,What kind of a business... Uh-oh.
Harvey,"Oh, hello, gentlemen."
Ben Wyatt,Gotta be kidding me.
Ben Wyatt,You own this place too?
Harvey,"That's right, dickweed."
Harvey,You wanna talk deal?
Harvey,Because my prices have gone up ever so slightly since I saw you last.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're not giving in to your crazy demands."
Ben Wyatt,There are plenty of other tent rental places within driving distance.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm calling Tent Emporium right now."
Harvey,Tent Emporium.
Harvey,"How can I help you, buttface?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Harvey,Yes.
Harvey,I own every tent store in Southern Indiana.
Harvey,"Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents, the Tent Offensive, and Ace Tentura Tent Detective."
Harvey,"I also own a chickfila franchise, but that's not doing so hot right now."
Harvey,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get outta here.
Harvey,You've reached the Tentagon.
Harvey,"How can I help you, buttface?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?"
Leslie Knope,"For example, I'm an only child."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Me too.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Although, when I was in college I found out that my dad had a second family."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, we were the second family, technically."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, we both went to college."
Leslie Knope,There's that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann had her baby!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this has been fun."
Leslie Knope,The bill is already paid.
Leslie Knope,May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr. Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope,Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, maybe you should look him up."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I don't know, I read a book once that said a woman should never make the first move."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't apply to therapy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good luck!
Ann Perkins,"Oliver Perkins-Traeger, meet your Aunt Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, he's so beautiful."
Leslie Knope,And you're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I knew you'd drop everything and rush here, and contractions can sometimes go for days."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,So I didn't want you to be stuck waiting around.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad I'm here now."
Leslie Knope,Where's Chris?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, he was such a good coach that the nurses asked him to help out with a delivery down the hall."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, you need to get your tooth fixed."
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not going back there.
Andy Dwyer,I already won all the magazine mazes.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be fine.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Ron Swanson,"If you don't take care of the problem now, it's only gonna get worse."
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,I'll drive you back.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,Let me just wolf down this peanut brittle real quick.
Andy Dwyer,Why would you do that?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, right."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause calories.
Tom Haverford,We're dead.
Tom Haverford,The only tent store this guy doesn't own is 300 miles away.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,Here's a place that might work.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, you can't rent tents there."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was doublechecking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy."
Jerry Gergich,So I dug around and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"Larry, this is great stuff."
Tom Haverford,"Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task."
Jerry Gergich,Couldn't agree more.
Jerry Gergich,"You did it, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Mm, I don't want to drive back."
Leslie Knope,I miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,No one even comes close to you as a friend.
Leslie Knope,"I even tried to rank the women at work, but that was a total bust."
Ann Perkins,You ranked them?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity--"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, Galentine's day?"
Leslie Knope,"What do you want me to do, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work."
Leslie Knope,Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.
Ann Perkins,Everybody brings their own unique strengths to the table.
Ann Perkins,Some that even I don't have.
Leslie Knope,You shut your mouth.
Leslie Knope,You have all the strengths.
Ann Perkins,"Look, you love harder than anyone I know."
Ann Perkins,It's tough to match.
Ann Perkins,"And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you."
Ann Perkins,And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, Friday Night Lights?"
Ann Perkins,"I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal."
Ann Perkins,He took the fall for his brother.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again."
Leslie Knope,That family is garbage.
Ann Perkins,The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends.
Ann Perkins,Just don't force it.
Ann Perkins,Give it some time.
Leslie Knope,"I know, you're right, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about."
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're here now, so let's talk."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I think Oliver has more pressing business.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day."
Leslie Knope,"What? Ann, you're somebody's mother."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna give you two some time.
Leslie Knope,I'll call you from the car.
Ron Swanson,I'll be out here if you need me.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks for doing this, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"When it's all said and done, there were a few mazes I'd cheated on."
Andy Dwyer,"Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot."
Andy Dwyer,"So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked?"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Diane."
Ron Swanson,"I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break."
Ron Swanson,It's no trouble at all.
Ron Swanson,I'm a parent.
Ron Swanson,I'm always on duty.
Ron Swanson,What flavor ice cream would you and the children like?
Ron Swanson,"I'm getting some for a 30-year-old who works for me, so I can bring some home for you too."
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed.
Ben Wyatt,I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.
Harvey,"Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments."
Harvey,I can tell that you're bluffing.
Tom Haverford,"Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year."
Tom Haverford,I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker.
Harvey,I am.
Harvey,And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.
Harvey,"Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here."
Harvey,I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows."
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature."
Ben Wyatt,Tom.
Ben Wyatt,The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.
Ben Wyatt,"We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price."
Ben Wyatt,"And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, hey."
Jerry Gergich,I'm Larry.
Jerry Gergich,Great to know you.
Jerry Gergich,I love tent world.
Tom Haverford,God! Can you just be cool for one second?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, black coffee with extra grounds."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,For April.
Leslie Knope,And a mocha ice blended for Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I totally blew it."
Leslie Knope,"I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,"You're wonderful friends, and I love you."
Donna Meagle,"We love your crazy ass too, Knope."
April Ludgate,I think you're fine.
April Ludgate,Like a solid B-minus.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,I'll take it.
April Ludgate,"We know you've been missing Ann, so we got you this."
Donna Meagle,Press the paw.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,It's Ann.
Ann Perkins,"I love you, and everything's gonna be okay."
Donna Meagle,"It's cute, right?"
Leslie Knope,I'm very lucky to have you both.
Leslie Knope,"You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug."
April Ludgate,"Mm, you touch me and I stab the bunny."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's about time for my mid-morning mani, so I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
