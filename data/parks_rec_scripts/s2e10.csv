Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Councilman Howser,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?
Councilman Howser,I have been busy.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.
Councilman Howser,I don't doubt it.
Councilman Howser,But it's really a question of resource allocation.
Leslie Knope,And I completely understand that.
Leslie Knope,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can."
Councilman Howser,I'm running late.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'll walk with you."
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks"
Ron Swanson,Just a reminder.
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow's a half day.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I had the trail survey hats made to commemorate the trip."
Ron Swanson,"Nice, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email."
Leslie Knope,The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.
Leslie Knope,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.
Leslie Knope,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office."
Tom Haverford,Not all the guys.
Tom Haverford,He's never taken me.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, all the men."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, let's cut the bull."
Leslie Knope,"I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip."
Ron Swanson,Hunting trip?
Ron Swanson,"We're doing a trail survey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Ron Swanson,Is this not rap?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,"Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition."
Leslie Knope,I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so fun!
Leslie Knope,I'll bring S'mores.
Ron Swanson,And just like that the one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,I need you to do something for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in."
Leslie Knope,Can I just tell you the 16 digit tracking number or do you want me to write it down?
Leslie Knope,I'll write it down.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
April Ludgate,You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"Well, try, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you."
April Ludgate,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ready to bag some birds?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,But I am ready to relax by the fire and get my Real Simple magazine on.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, gross."
Phone Voice,"Hello, you have reached the Indiana State Parks Department."
Phone Voice,Your call is very important to us.
Phone Voice,Please stay on the line.
Leslie Knope,"All right, here we go!"
Ann Perkins,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,There he is.
Ann Perkins,There's Ron!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it's pretty!"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Ann Perkins,I thought it was gonna be gross.
Jerry Gergich,Holy cow.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, it is good to be back."
Mark Brendanawicz,Sneak attack!
Jerry Gergich,Damn it!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants King!
Mark Brendanawicz,Bow to me.
Jerry Gergich,Bow!
Jerry Gergich,I bow!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants--
Leslie Knope,I am the Pants Queen.
Tom Haverford,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,Bow to the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,"When you're out with the boys, you gotta be ready for a good pantsing."
Leslie Knope,That's why I have suspenders that connect my bra to my jeans.
Tom Haverford,Ron 'P. Diddy' Combs.
Tom Haverford,"I have to admit, this place is pretty tight."
Tom Haverford,May I interest anyone in some chew?
Ron Swanson,"Nice touch, Haverford."
Leslie Knope,Let me get some of that.
Ron Swanson,You sure?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I would not have pegged you as a user of mouth tobacco.
Leslie Knope,"I'm full of surprises, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man."
Tom Haverford,My stomach's a little upset.
Tom Haverford,I feel a little queasy.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that might be the chew."
Mark Brendanawicz,You could spit it out.
Tom Haverford,I swallowed it.
Tom Haverford,"You're supposed to swallow it, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Ron Swanson,Poor little buddy.
Leslie Knope,Why they call it chew and not swallow.
Leslie Knope,"Am I right, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are right."
Leslie Knope,"All right, safety basics!"
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?"
Donna Meagle,Is that a trick question?
Leslie Knope,"No, Donna, don't!"
Leslie Knope,Please!
Ron Swanson,"Rule number one, do not point the weapon at a person."
Ron Swanson,"That includes your own face, Donna."
Ron Swanson,"Now, every year, before we go on our first hunt, we do a toast."
Ron Swanson,"So, grab a beer."
Ron Swanson,To the hunt.
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,And to the hunters!
Leslie Knope,The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.
Jerry Gergich,Pretty good.
Jerry Gergich,"Here, here!"
Ann Perkins,"Here, here!"
Donna Meagle,Yeah!
Donna Meagle,Right on!
Donna Meagle,Cheers.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, your toast sucked."
Ron Swanson,"The traditional toast is ""To the hunt!"""
Ron Swanson,And it is said by me.
Ron Swanson,"You all set, Mark?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy girl, boy girl."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you said that we were gonna hunt together."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection."
Leslie Knope,I have to hunt with Ron.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, we'll go together."
Leslie Knope,Perfect!
Leslie Knope,"All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!"
Ron Swanson,Bully.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,"Can you come here, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
April Ludgate,"I've been on hold for, like, an hour and I really have to pee."
April Ludgate,"Can you just sit here for two seconds and just listen, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"And if they answer, can you just read those numbers out loud?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Okay, thanks."
Leslie Knope,Now here's the female adolescent turkey.
Leslie Knope,Could you hear the difference?
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Turkeys can.
Jerry Gergich,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ron Swanson,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ron Swanson,We do that the first time one of us hits something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cool!"
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola--"
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,You missed it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of man on man on man action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip."
Ron Swanson,That's fine.
Ron Swanson,I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor--
Ron Swanson,What the hell?
Ron Swanson,Give me some warning!
Leslie Knope,I saw a quail.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose."
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ann Perkins,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Leslie Knope,I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.
Leslie Knope,Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check this out."
Andy Dwyer,"I am on hold with the State Parks Department I am on hold, so suck on my butt."
April Ludgate,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"They didn't answer, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
April Ludgate,Hunting trip.
Andy Dwyer,Hunting trip?
Andy Dwyer,Did Mark go?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"That's cool, at least he's not with Ann."
April Ludgate,"No, Ann's there."
Andy Dwyer,God!
Andy Dwyer,How come he gets to do all the things I wanna do?
Andy Dwyer,"Go hunting, Ann."
April Ludgate,Maybe a deer will eat him.
Andy Dwyer,That would be really awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"But I don't think that will happen, probably."
Leslie Knope,You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you're a girl.
Ron Swanson,I just don't like change.
Ron Swanson,"I like going to the same place with the same people, telling the same stories and seeing who can bag the most turkeys."
Leslie Knope,It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.
Ron Swanson,A hundred bucks says I bag more birds than you.
Ron Swanson,You're on.
Ron Swanson,Let's split up.
Ron Swanson,I do it better alone.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you do!"
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Just one of the guys.
Tom Haverford,Your favorite kind of cake can't be birthday cake.
Tom Haverford,That's like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal.
Donna Meagle,"Mmm, I love breakfast cereal."
Tom Haverford,Look!
Tom Haverford,Some kind of bird!
Tom Haverford,Let's kill it!
Tom Haverford,"You talking to me, bitch?"
Jerry Gergich,What were you aiming at?
Donna Meagle,Nothing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I can understand why people like that.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right?
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,And keeping one's eyes open is always a good rule of thumb around guns.
Jerry Gergich,This is such a great day.
Jerry Gergich,"See, at my house, I got a wife and three beautiful daughters."
Jerry Gergich,"But this trip, it is the one time of year I get to pee standing up."
Jerry Gergich,I love that sound.
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,Somebody shot me in the head!
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,Over here.
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, right there."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I got your hat!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have your hat!"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Are you in a lot of pain?
Ron Swanson,I was shot in the head with a shotgun.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's actually not that serious."
Ann Perkins,"I just need you to stay calm, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'm just gonna stay angry."
Ron Swanson,I find that relaxes me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, damn!"
Ron Swanson,This is a mess.
Ron Swanson,The rangers won't let us come back next year.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ann Perkins,We're not gonna think about that right now.
Ann Perkins,"You guys, can you just put him on the day bed in the carcass room?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Day bed?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now."
Jerry Gergich,Hold on!
Jerry Gergich,Hold on!
Ann Perkins,Is that Donna?
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, easy."
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't worry.
Ann Perkins,Are you okay?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Is it your heart?
Ann Perkins,Are you having trouble breathing?
Donna Meagle,It's my car.
Donna Meagle,Someone shot my car!
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's here.
Jerry Gergich,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There we go, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what is great?"
Leslie Knope,Ann's gonna take care of you.
Leslie Knope,And Ann is the best nurse in North America.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Ron Swanson,Did you shoot me?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, I swear, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you better find out who it was."
Ron Swanson,"And then, purchase them a coffin, because I'm gonna rip them apart."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
April Ludgate,Polo!
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
April Ludgate,Polo!
Andy Dwyer,Marco?
April Ludgate,Polo!
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
April Ludgate,Polo!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,How are you feeling?
Leslie Knope,How are you feeling?
Ann Perkins,Are you dizzy?
Leslie Knope,Are you dizzy or--
Ann Perkins,Are you lightheaded?
Ron Swanson,"When I look at my palm, I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog."
Ron Swanson,Is that normal?
Leslie Knope,Is that normal?
Ann Perkins,"Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong."
Ann Perkins,Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
Ann Perkins,How many did you take?
Ron Swanson,Seven.
Ron Swanson,Eight.
Ron Swanson,But I washed them down with plenty of fluids.
Ann Perkins,"No, Ron, you cannot drink Scotch with this."
Ann Perkins,"You're gonna need to purge, right now!"
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ron Swanson,No!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not wasting 20 year scotch."
Ann Perkins,Can you open his mouth?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'm not making myself throw up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry we have to do this!
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you have to."
Ann Perkins,Ron?
Leslie Knope,This is for your own good.
Ron Swanson,I will bite you!
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, get, grab his mustache!"
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Just-- Open your mouth!
Ann Perkins,His shoulders!
Leslie Knope,"Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably."
Tom Haverford,Is he okay?
Tom Haverford,Is he gonna live?
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.
Tom Haverford,"On a scale of one to Chris Brown, how pissed is he?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's very curious about who shot him."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you did it, just say, ""I did it."""
Leslie Knope,"Come on, person who shot Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head."
Tom Haverford,Maybe Ron shot himself.
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately."
Mark Brendanawicz,He was shot in the back of the head.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,He loves the back of his head.
Leslie Knope,He would never shoot himself there.
Tom Haverford,It could have been someone else that shot Ron.
Tom Haverford,Someone not in our group.
Jerry Gergich,You think someone is hunting us?
Tom Haverford,Man is the most dangerous game.
Donna Meagle,To The Predator.
Tom Haverford,I did smell something out there.
Tom Haverford,And it wasn't human.
Leslie Knope,That was pine trees.
Donna Meagle,The Predator can see heat.
Tom Haverford,We should cover ourselves in mud.
Tom Haverford,It could still be out there.
Donna Meagle,Did you hear that?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Actually, I did hear something."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,There's someone out there.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get my gun.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Scare him off and shoot over his head!
Tom Haverford,What's that gonna do? I'm gonna shoot under its head!
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't shoot anyone!
Leslie Knope,Whoa! Where are you going?
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Extra,Hey! Don't shoot! Hey!
Extra,It's Craig from Reinhold Mercedes!
Donna Meagle,"Craig! Craig, I got you, dog! Craig! Don't worry, I'm coming!"
Ron Swanson,"Attention, person who shot me in the head! I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna tear you apart."
Ann Perkins,Ron! Bed! Now!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
April Ludgate,That man wasn't my brother.
April Ludgate,He was my husband.
Andy Dwyer,How was that? That wasn't good?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you can do better."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Give me another one.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I'm pregnant with Josh Groban's baby.
April Ludgate,That was good.
Andy Dwyer,You do one.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,What do you mean the squirrel took the nuts out of the... Out of that kid's backpack and ate them?
April Ludgate,But you have to give me a reason to spit.
April Ludgate,To spit! You asked me aâ¦
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah."
April Ludgate,Don't ask me a question.
Andy Dwyer,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Not a question.
April Ludgate,"Okay, ready?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I've lived in Pawnee my whole life.
Andy Dwyer,That is a fact.
Andy Dwyer,A fact about me.
Andy Dwyer,And howâ¦
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is he?
Ann Perkins,He's pretty out of it.
Ann Perkins,He's talking about you in his sleep.
Leslie Knope,Good stuff?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,How's it going out there?
Leslie Knope,Terribly.
Leslie Knope,No one will admit they shot Ron.
Leslie Knope,And no one saw it happen.
Ann Perkins,I know what happened.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Park Ranger,"Listen, I heard about the accident."
Park Ranger,And I need to know who is responsible.
Jerry Gergich,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Ron and I saw Jerry
Jerry Gergich,That's the problem.
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,I shot Ron Swanson.
Donna Meagle,You shot my Mercedes?
Leslie Knope,What? No! No!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, follow my light."
Ann Perkins,"No, not your whole head."
Ann Perkins,Just your eyes.
Ann Perkins,Just... Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What month is it?
Leslie Knope,November.
Ann Perkins,Why are you taking the blame for this?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,I know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope,Just go look after Ron.
Park Ranger,So what happened? Did you forget to check the entire field? I find a lot of women have problems with tunnel vision.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm an excellent hunter.
Park Ranger,How did you end up shooting a guy in the head then?
Leslie Knope,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
Park Ranger,"Ah, so you forgot to put the safety on."
Leslie Knope,"No, I always have the safety on."
Leslie Knope,"I'm... While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it."
Park Ranger,In mid-trip?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's-- Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I got that tunnel vision that girls get.
Leslie Knope,And that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,End of story.
Park Ranger,"I think you're hysterical because of all the excitement, obviously."
Park Ranger,"So, I'm just not following your story."
Park Ranger,All right?
Leslie Knope,I let my emotions get the best of me.
Leslie Knope,"I just I would I cared too much, I guess."
Leslie Knope,I was thinking with my lady parts.
Leslie Knope,I was walking and I felt something icky.
Leslie Knope,I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
Leslie Knope,I don't even remember.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off."
Leslie Knope,"All I wanna do is have babies! Are you single? I'm just, like, going through a thing right now."
Leslie Knope,I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone.
Leslie Knope,This would not happen if I had a penis.
Leslie Knope,What? Bitches be crazy.
Leslie Knope,I'm good at tolerating pain.
Leslie Knope,I'm bad at math.
Leslie Knope,And I'm stupid.
April Ludgate,I wonder what they're doing right now.
Andy Dwyer,Probably making out on top of a deer carcass.
Andy Dwyer,Super romantic.
April Ludgate,"You know, if I gave you a hickey, it would totally make Ann jealous."
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I think that would... That's pretty gross."
Andy Dwyer,Seems kind of weird.
April Ludgate,What's weird about one friend sucking on another friend's neck?
Andy Dwyer,"When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that weird at all."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not."
April Ludgate,I gave my gay boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey and it totally made my gay boyfriend jealous.
Andy Dwyer,Really? All right.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go sterilize my neck.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,What?
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple of months."
Ron Swanson,I usually watch it with my brothers.
Ron Swanson,Maybe you could come by at halftime and shoot me in the head.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend."
Ron Swanson,"Perhaps next time I'm enjoying some alone time in the men's restroom, you could invite yourself into my stall and shoot me in the head."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure."
Ron Swanson,"How about you shoot me in the head? Oh, wait, you already did that."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tom, can I talk to you for a second?"
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, this is amazing."
Ann Perkins,Now.
Ann Perkins,I need to talk to you now.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Okay! Whoa! Ann! Whoa, are we finally gonna do this? Ow!"
Ann Perkins,I saw you shoot Ron.
Ann Perkins,"Okay? Leslie covered for you, but I'm not gonna let her take any more crap from Ron on your sorry ass behalf."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, for the record, I was gonna come forward and I'll do it right now."
Tom Haverford,"But afterwards, can we come back here and talk about us?"
Ron Swanson,"Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's office getting my prostate examined, you could come by and shoot me in the head!"
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, everyone."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I have something to say."
Ron Swanson,"Hang on a minute, Tom, I'm not done berating Leslie."
Tom Haverford,It wasn't Leslie's fault.
Tom Haverford,She was covering for me because I didn't have a hunting license.
Tom Haverford,I was the one who shot you.
Ron Swanson,"You didn't get a license? What kind of moron doesn't get a license? That's reckless endangerment, my son."
Ron Swanson,"That's a 25,000 fine dollars, minimum, and probably jail time."
Tom Haverford,"But she covered for me, and I'm in the clear."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,She kept her mouth shut and now you're in the clear.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let--"
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,You did good.
Ron Swanson,You're a real stand-up guy.
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
Ron Swanson,It was 'cause I was shot in the head by a moron.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry."
Ron Swanson,"Apology not accepted, moron."
Ann Perkins,Pants King!
Leslie Knope,Pants Queen!
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm! Turkey's great.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron Swanson!"
Jerry Gergich,Hey!
Mark Brendanawicz,Ron Swanson!
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, all."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hey!"
Ron Swanson,"Welcome back, Ron."
Ron Swanson,That's terrific.
Ron Swanson,"Thanks, you guys."
Ron Swanson,Let's eat!
