Character,Line
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I don't want to over-hype this, but presenting... Dun-da-da-dah!"
Ben Wyatt,the new city of Pawnee website!
Ben Wyatt,Totally revamped!
Leslie Knope,"You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, look a panda!"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's just some mascot thing that the designer put up on the front page."
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, you can now apply for a utility tax refund online!"
Donna Meagle,"Wait, the panda's name is Peebo."
April Ludgate,Peebo.
Jerry Gergich,"Look, you can even play pingpong."
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,I want to play!
Andy Dwyer,"No, me first!"
Andy Dwyer,Me first!
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm calling it.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the online polls.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,The panda holds a paddle with his tail.
Leslie Knope,I want to play!
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Ben."
Ron Swanson,This is truly a fine panda game you made.
Ron Swanson,Well done.
April Ludgate,What else does he do?
Ben Wyatt,"I think if you click on the bamboo, it puts on a top hat."
All,What?
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, Ben!"
Craig Middlebrooks,What's wrong with you?
Craig Middlebrooks,You look like Meryl Streep at the end of Ironweed.
Craig Middlebrooks,You wish.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I've been driving all over Indiana looking for bands to play the unity concert."
Andy Dwyer,"I got nothing to show for, except for four car accidents."
Andy Dwyer,All these strangers' insurance information.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I get it, you have car insurance."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you brag about it?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you are from Eagleton, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Are there any places out there I should check out?
Craig Middlebrooks,I used to go see live shows at Patterson's.
Craig Middlebrooks,But I'm boycotting until the owner apologizes for what she said to me at the dog park.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,Anything else?
Craig Middlebrooks,I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.
Craig Middlebrooks,But I've never been because it's mostly middle aged women and I'm allergic to turkey neck.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,That's the best part.
Andy Dwyer,We should split a turkey sometime.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for meeting me here.
Grant Larson,Happy to.
Grant Larson,I was in the area.
Grant Larson,The chance for me to return your binder full of questions about the job.
Grant Larson,I think I answered all of them.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to check this out.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here"
Grant Larson,More questions about the job.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Martha?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.
Leslie Knope,Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.
Leslie Knope,This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project."
Leslie Knope,"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?"
Leslie Knope,"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot."
Grant Larson,"Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things."
Grant Larson,"I mean, you're overseeing 200 people."
Grant Larson,The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.
Grant Larson,"Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff."
Grant Larson,No more boring people working for you.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,I hate paperwork.
Leslie Knope,I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle.
Tom Haverford,My favorite realtor.
Tom Haverford,You got some hot properties to show me?
Donna Meagle,You know it.
Tom Haverford,"Remember my list of must haves: Open kitchen, fireplace, exposed brick, and you know I wouldn't kick a skylight out of bed."
Tom Haverford,"I'm opening Pawnee's first authentic Sinatra style Italian restaurant ""Tom's Bistro."""
Tom Haverford,"I'm kind of like a skinny, handsome, Indian Mario Batali who doesn't know how to cook."
Tom Haverford,"Before we go, I got you guys a little something for helping me out."
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Love it!
April Ludgate,A Larry voodoo doll?
April Ludgate,"Tom, that's so sweet."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Jerry Gergich,Ow!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh!"
April Ludgate,I didn't even do anything.
April Ludgate,The voodoo doll is reading my thoughts.
Ben Wyatt,"So it seems like it went really well, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, totally."
Leslie Knope,"Grant is great, the job is great."
Leslie Knope,The waffles were great.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,So we're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll.
Ben Wyatt,You want to see?
Leslie Knope,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.
Leslie Knope,"There is New York, the city that never sleeps."
Leslie Knope,"And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so people can vote now."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not gonna do that."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, what?"
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass."
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I did."
Donna Meagle,So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.
Donna Meagle,But you can't outrun the whale meat police forever.
Tom Haverford,This is great.
Tom Haverford,I love it!
Tom Haverford,"Look at it, I can picture it now."
Tom Haverford,"That's where the politicians will sit, this is where the connected guys will bring their goomahs."
Tom Haverford,This place is perfect.
Tom Haverford,How much?
Donna Meagle,"9,000 a month."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,That's way more that I can afford.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,It's not that great.
April Ludgate,"Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying."
Tom Haverford,It's not a big deal.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job."
Donna Meagle,"Come on, I'll show some places in your price range."
Leslie Knope,"This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Mr. Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I told you, I'm not gonna participate in your weird Julia Roberts, cameraman husband fantasy."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here."
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan."
Perd Hapley,And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.
Leslie Knope,"So true, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future."""
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of my interest level is: It's medium."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town."
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, great question."
Joan Callamezzo,I have been thinking of rebranding myself.
Joan Callamezzo,What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?
Leslie Knope,"Isn't ""Juan"" a man's name?"
Joan Callamezzo,"No, it means ""flower."""
Leslie Knope,"I think it means ""John."""
Crazy Ira,"Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove."
Crazy Ira,"Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes, I do."
The Douche,"Followup question, Leslie, show us your boobs!"
Crazy Ira,Will this fit on a bumper sticker?
Andy Dwyer,"Gosh, this place is packed."
Andy Dwyer,You folks must really like this guy.
Extra,"Honey, he is sex on a stick."
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, put your jazzy hands together for my man, Mr. Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,A smooth and silky evening to you all.
Ron Swanson,"On nights like this, when the cold winds blow, and the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dreams, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz."
All,Uh!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the good news is your poll was a big hit."
Ben Wyatt,Thousands of people voted.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,What's leading?
Leslie Knope,"""Storied past, bright future""?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"The current leader is ""Pawnee, welcome to Douche nation."""
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.
Ben Wyatt,Why did we include a write-in option?
Leslie Knope,Because every election has a write-in option.
Leslie Knope,That's how democracy works.
Leslie Knope,I'm not a dictator.
Leslie Knope,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial."
Leslie Knope,"I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to go on their show.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to do this."
Leslie Knope,I enjoy the challenge.
Leslie Knope,"So, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,"I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill."
Ben Wyatt,Is this gonna work?
The Douche,"Oh, what up, Lez?"
The Douche,Backwards hatshows a real lack of respect for authority.
The Douche,I like that.
The Douche,"What's up, little mayor?"
The Douche,Are you gonna freak out again?
Crazy Ira,"So, Leslie, what's the deal?"
Crazy Ira,Are you just here to yell at us again?
The Douche,"Yeah, we are in store for another Leslie Knope nag sesh?"
Extra,"Crazy Ira, do the dishes!"
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,No way!
Leslie Knope,"I'm not here to nag, guys."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I'm justâ¦ chillin' in the studes with my dudes.
Crazy Ira,"If you're really not really here to nag us, then maybe you'll help us with our next segment ""Rating celebrities' boobs!"""
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
The Douche,"On a scale, from 1 to gagagagoing!"
The Douche,How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A."""
The Douche,You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw a donation from charity.
Leslie Knope,From charity?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,A minus.
Crazy Ira,More like double D minus.
Extra,Me so horny!
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Andy Dwyer,I was out at the jazz club last night scouting bands for the unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,And I saw something very interesting.
Ron Swanson,I am Duke Silver.
Andy Dwyer,You have a twin brother.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,I have a twin brother.
Andy Dwyer,You are Duke Silver?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,The only other people who know are Tom and April.
Ron Swanson,"So, please, keep it to yourself."
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
Andy Dwyer,You are really good!
Andy Dwyer,"You are, like, the saxophone player for the California raisins good."
Andy Dwyer,No joke.
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,I'm booking you for the unity concert.
Ron Swanson,Absolutely not.
Ron Swanson,My musical career is private.
Ron Swanson,"If my secret got out, this office would be waist deep in women's undergarments."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm in charge of booking the bands for the concert, and I say, you're in."
Andy Dwyer,You're gonna play right after Bobby knight ranger.
Andy Dwyer,It's a night ranger cover band where they only wear read sweaters.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be epic!
Crazy Ira,"Final round, Leslie, boobs or ass?"
Leslie Knope,Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.
Leslie Knope,Ahâ¦ I'm gonna say butt.
Extra,"Ding, ding, ding!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Crazy Ira,You are correct.
Crazy Ira,This is my mom's dumper!
Crazy Ira,"Oh, mommy!"
Leslie Knope,I don't know how you got yours hand on that.
The Douche,I took it.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it is been so fun broing out with my dogs."
Leslie Knope,I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.
The Douche,"We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to write-in ""Welcome to Douche nation!"""
The Douche,As the official town slogan for pawneecity.gov.
Leslie Knope,Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?
Leslie Knope,It's vote for another slogan.
Leslie Knope,"Like, you know, ""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,Butâ¦ I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"I don't give a fart, bros."
Leslie Knope,"You know, just do your thing, chicken wing."
The Douche,"Hey, Crazy Ira, have you seen my stick?"
Crazy Ira,Where's your stick?
The Douche,I don't know.
The Douche,"Lesbo Baggins, you know where my stick is?"
Leslie Knope,You--
The Douche,Oh!
The Douche,Found my stick.
Crazy Ira,"Oh, where did you find it?"
The Douche,Up Leslie Knope's butt!
Extra,"Yo, where my stick up?"
Extra,"It's up her butt, papi."
Crazy Ira,"Jewish Greg, whatever we're paying you, it's not enough."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, I almost pulled that off."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you really didn't."
Ben Wyatt,Just delete the poll.
Ben Wyatt,Let the slogan thing go.
Leslie Knope,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I should just let this go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,That looks like a perfectly good saxophone case.
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,What's inside that case?
Ron Swanson,I am ending my secret musical career.
Ron Swanson,I have to kill Duke Silver.
Andy Dwyer,"No, come on, man."
Andy Dwyer,You're really good.
Andy Dwyer,You can't quit.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,May you restâ¦ in jazz.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert."
Morris,Uhâ¦ yeah.
Morris,You can say that.
Leslie Knope,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Morris,"Yeah, yeah."
Morris,I voted for that one.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate with everybody who voted?"
Morris,"Yeah, I can do that."
Morris,Should take about two minutes.
Morris,Just PayPal me some bitcoins when you get a chance.
Leslie Knope,What?
Donna Meagle,"So, this is way under your budget."
Donna Meagle,Used to be a donut shop.
Donna Meagle,"Well, a tire shop that sold donuts."
Tom Haverford,Pretty rough.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters."
Tom Haverford,Do something about the smell.
April Ludgate,This place is creepy.
April Ludgate,"I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me."
Donna Meagle,This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what happened?"
Tom Haverford,I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.
Extra,We stretched ourselves too thin by expanding to a second location.
April Ludgate,You opened another dinosaur themed restaurant?
Extra,"No, another Steven Spielberg themed restaurant."
Extra,The German place downtown Schindler's Lunch.
Tom Haverford,I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.
Tom Haverford,I actually think the space is pretty cool.
Tom Haverford,"Obviously, we'd had to move this T-Rex, but--"
Extra,No can do.
Extra,That's a load-bearing T-Rex.
Tom Haverford,This is really the last place you have available?
Tom Haverford,Dang.
Tom Haverford,Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.
Leslie Knope,You wanted to see me?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, real quick."
Ben Wyatt,Remember when you said you would close up shop on the slogan thing?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"You did do that, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the ""Stick up the butt"" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?"
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, someone wrote those emails."
Ben Wyatt,And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.
Ben Wyatt,Look what they did to Peebo.
Ben Wyatt,He's wearing a hat made of penises.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well I.T. is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days."
Leslie Knope,"Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally."
Leslie Knope,"Parking tickets, code violations... send them all to me."
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands on stuff that I love to do."
Leslie Knope,"I would miss that, very much."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?"
Ben Wyatt,"But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond."
Ben Wyatt,"You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Use it as a test.
Ben Wyatt,"Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,I guess I should practice delegating.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The public forum will be run byâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here."
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, can you get in here?"
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.
Jerry Gergich,Gosh darn it.
Jerry Gergich,II somehow ran my belt through a slat in this chair so I'm kind ofâ¦ I'm kind of stuck to it now.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.
Andy Dwyer,I had to.
Andy Dwyer,Also I had a banana on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry."
Andy Dwyer,You secret is safe with me.
Andy Dwyer,"To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, that's not necessary."
Andy Dwyer,I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't actually sell my last car.
Andy Dwyer,I just forgot where I parked it.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know who Al Gore is.
Andy Dwyer,And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Andy Dwyer,"When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is."
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me."
Andy Dwyer,"I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca."
Ron Swanson,"That'll do, Andrew."
Andy Dwyer,You don't have to play the unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,But don't quit music.
Andy Dwyer,Please.
April Ludgate,Tommy.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
April Ludgate,Are you okay?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.
April Ludgate,"Well, I got you something to cheer you up."
April Ludgate,Watch cologne.
Tom Haverford,Cologne for watches.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,Things used to make me so happy.
Tom Haverford,But I've grown a lot in the last year.
Tom Haverford,"Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want."
Tom Haverford,I should go.
April Ludgate,"I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them."
Donna Meagle,"Damn, we should have coordinated."
Donna Meagle,I don't want to lose that weird little elf either.
Donna Meagle,That's why I showed him all those crappy places.
April Ludgate,"Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,What should we do?
Donna Meagle,Let me call some people.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, let's just get started, huh?"
Jerry Gergich,"I want to talk about-- Oh, it's the-- geez Louise-- This keeps happening."
Jerry Gergich,I don't know why.
Chance Frenlm,"I think the slogan should be ""Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana."""
Jerry Gergich,Okey-dokey.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jerry Gergich,Let me write it down.
Herman,Who even needs a slogan?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, now, that is an interesting point."
Herman,"No, that's my slogan idea."
Herman,"""Who even needs a slogan?"" And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off."
The Douche,"Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Crazy Ira,Butt stick! Butt stick! Butt stick!
The Douche,Let's vote on it right now! Butt stick! Butt stick!
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Who's next?
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am."
Extra,This slogan is gonna go on every sign in town.
Extra,I think it should be something real that we can all be proud of.
Extra,"I've lived in Pawnee my whole life and it could be a strange place, but overall it's a warm, and wonderful town."
Extra,"My idea for a slogan is, ""When you're here, then you're home."""
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that's lovely."
Extra,I actually had it printed up so we can see what it would look like.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong."
Leslie Knope,"That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n."
Ben Wyatt,Stay strong.
Ben Wyatt,Let them work it out.
Ben Wyatt,And trust Larry.
Leslie Knope,Trust Larry?
Leslie Knope,Are you listening to yourself?
Extra,I like that slogan a lot.
Extra,But you made a little mistake there.
Ben Wyatt,You see?
Leslie Knope,Back off.
Extra,"""You're"" is spelled wrong."
Extra,"It should be ""y-o-u-r."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oops, I didn't catch it."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, she made a possessive."
Leslie Knope,She's getting further away.
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, let's vote."
Jerry Gergich,All those in favor.
Jerry Gergich,Approved!
Tom Haverford,"Man, the places that came on the market today are way nicer than the listings we saw yesterday."
April Ludgate,"I know, crazy, right? Real estate."
Donna Meagle,"This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me."
Donna Meagle,Except the two helipads.
Tom Haverford,Does it have one helipad? I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"I like it, butâ¦ seems a little small."
April Ludgate,"No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture."
April Ludgate,But that part is really great.
April Ludgate,The lighting is really cool.
April Ludgate,I think this is the one.
Tom Haverford,"You know, I think you're right."
Tom Haverford,I'll do it.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, April."
Tom Haverford,"And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall."
Tom Haverford,You guys are gonna be regulars.
Tom Haverford,I'll keep a table open for you.
Councilman Milton,And special thanks to Leslie Knope for once again bringing about positive change to this town.
Councilman Milton,"Pawnee, I present to you, your new slogan."
Ben Wyatt,You fixed the mistakes.
Leslie Knope,I held it together for the entire meeting.
Leslie Knope,Let me have this one.
Leslie Knope,I'm done micromanaging.
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.
Leslie Knope,"What? No! Oh, son of a--"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you passed the test."
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about."
Leslie Knope,"The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do."
Leslie Knope,What if I take this national parks jobs and I justâ¦ fail?
Ben Wyatt,Hm.
Leslie Knope,What if I'm not good at it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I love you, very much."
Ben Wyatt,But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Ben Wyatt,You'd be amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"And everyone's gonna be in awe of how amazing you are, so just shut your month."
Extra,"Hey, are we leaving or entering? We've been driving around in circles."
Leslie Knope,You're--
