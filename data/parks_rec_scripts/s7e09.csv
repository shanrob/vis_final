Character,Line
Jennifer Barkley,We need to go over the schedule leading up to the primary.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's talk shop.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, shop talk."
Leslie Knope,"One of my five favorite types of talk, along with pillow, girl, real, and TED."
Ben Wyatt,Why are you wearing a poncho?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, because every surface area in your house is sticky."
Jennifer Barkley,"Last time I was here, I found a melted crayon on my blazer."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I have a photo op with Gryzzl tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,Between now and then we have a ton of stuff scheduled.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we're gonna have to skip the pie baking event and the ceremonial squash toss.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,We have to skip that?
Leslie Knope,I love watching those squashes fly through the air.
Ben Wyatt,I kind of like the way they land.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, excuse me, but I have to get back to a city, where things happen."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,This campaign is about to start in earnest.
Jennifer Barkley,Things are about to get real intense.
Jennifer Barkley,"Leslie, you ready?"
Leslie Knope,"Me, Leslie?"
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was an actual candidate, so I think I can handle being a candidate's wife."
Leslie Knope,I know all the issues inside and out.
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmm, see, that's the problem."
Jennifer Barkley,Being the wife of is a minefield.
Jennifer Barkley,"If you were just a dingdong, I would just slap a flag pin on you, and pour some Valium down your throat, and just shove you behind the podium way upstage."
Jennifer Barkley,It's the smarties that freak people out.
Leslie Knope,I think you're underestimating the voters.
Jennifer Barkley,I don't think that is possible.
Leslie Knope,"Stephen, be careful."
Jennifer Barkley,Poncho!
April Ludgate,"I know you normally hate foundations, but this one I think you'll actually like."
April Ludgate,We take people that don't know what they wanna do and then put them to work doing cool stuff all over the world.
April Ludgate,And I start in a couple months.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I had hoped you'd choose a more dignified trade like masonry or logging."
Ron Swanson,"But you are out of local government, and that's a step in the right direction."
April Ludgate,It's definitely the job I wanted.
April Ludgate,But it means that we have to move to Washington.
Ron Swanson,Well.
Ron Swanson,Then bully for you.
Ron Swanson,"If you intend to move, I suppose you should return the spare key to my house."
Ron Swanson,"The one I gave you years ago when you were my assistant, for emergencies."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ben Wyatt,This neighborhood has been mostly abandoned for years.
Ben Wyatt,"But now, thanks to the new Gryzzl headquarters, this district will soon transform into a hub of innovation for decades to come."
Reporter,Mister Wyatt.
Reporter,Your campaign released a schedule.
Reporter,And it looks like your wife is skipping the Pie Mary.
Reporter,Care to explain?
Leslie Knope,"The Pie Mary is a Southern Indiana tradition, where Congressional candidates' wives face off in a pie baking contest."
Leslie Knope,The last contest's winner was June Hartwell's buttermilk meringue.
Leslie Knope,Last contest's loser was all women.
Reporter,Leslie would be the first candidate's wife not to enter the Pie Mary.
Reporter,What kind of a statement are you making by skipping it?
Leslie Knope,We're-- I'm not making any kind of statement.
Leslie Knope,"We're just focusing on bigger issues, like Ben's 150 million dollar revitalization project."
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,I need to get through.
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,Excuse me.
Mike Patterson,Mike Patterson here.
Mike Patterson,"Leslie, you made it pretty clear that you don't think homemaking is important."
Mike Patterson,Do you ever cook for your children?
Mike Patterson,And who's even watching your children right now while you're out God only knows where?
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I'm standing right here in front of you.
Mike Patterson,"Okay, take it easy."
Mike Patterson,Let's not get emotional.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to run."
Ben Wyatt,We'll see you all at my economic address.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
Mike Patterson,"What other traditions are you against, Leslie?"
Mike Patterson,Baseball?
Mike Patterson,Hugging your children?
Mike Patterson,How much did that haircut cost?
Leslie Knope,None of your business.
Leslie Knope,And thank you for noticing.
Andy Dwyer,My desk was right here.
Andy Dwyer,Sitting right on top of it this whole time.
Andy Dwyer,How much money is it?
April Ludgate,It's not money.
April Ludgate,I told you.
April Ludgate,It's Ron's key.
April Ludgate,I hid it in here years ago.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No key.
Andy Dwyer,Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.
April Ludgate,"""If you are looking for Ron's key, I moved it, and you'll never find it."""
April Ludgate,"""Cordially, April."""
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you put it then?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,It was eight years ago.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,A key to Ron's house is lost in a government building.
April Ludgate,It's his worst nightmare.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, babe."
Andy Dwyer,All we gotta do is train Champion to sniff out Ron's key.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,All we need is Ron's key to give him a scent.
Andy Dwyer,So give me the key and I'll get you that key.
Mike Patterson,Welcome back to the program.
Mike Patterson,"My guest is June Hartwell, wife of incumbent Congressman Paul Hartwell."
Mike Patterson,"Now, June, we all know what Ben Wyatt's wife is really saying."
Mike Patterson,"By skipping the Pie Mary, she's saying, ""Women who love their families are stupid."""
June Hartwell,"Mike, we all make certain choices."
June Hartwell,Ms. Knope chose to try to have it all.
June Hartwell,I chose to put my family first.
Mike Patterson,"Oh, I'm just speculating here, but do you think that Leslie Knope's actions indicate that she actually hates her family?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right."
Leslie Knope,I'm officially a distraction.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.
Ben Wyatt,"This is just nonsense, it'll blow over."
Ben Wyatt,And the Pie Mary is ridiculous and antiquated.
Leslie Knope,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my self-published women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
April Ludgate,"I had it in a safe place, and then I moved it to protect it, and I don't remember where."
Ron Swanson,I see.
Andy Dwyer,"Don't be mad, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"She hid it too good, and she left a string of clues."
Ron Swanson,It's an impossible puzzle.
Ron Swanson,And I love puzzles.
Ron Swanson,"A minimal, unhelpful note, these appear to be human teeth."
Ron Swanson,And what is this?
Ron Swanson,Twilight: New Moon?
April Ludgate,"It's a movie, but I've never seen it."
April Ludgate,"It's, like, about lame werewolves and vampires and stuff."
Ron Swanson,Donna likes those things.
Ron Swanson,Dollars to donuts this points us her way.
Ron Swanson,"Finally, a scavenger hunt worthy of my time."
Ron Swanson,Onward!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping."
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I got everything you need for pie domination.
Ben Wyatt,"I even got an extra whipped cream can, one for baking, one for directly into mouth."
Leslie Knope,You know me so well.
Leslie Knope,That might be one of the kids.
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, Leslie."
Elise Yarktin,"Elise Yarktin, from the Indiana Organization of Women."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my goodness, Elise."
Leslie Knope,"Please, come in."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?
Leslie Knope,I have a speech prepared.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see it?
Leslie Knope,Right now?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,"Leslie, we were thrilled to find out you were boycotting that ridiculous Pie Mary."
Elise Yarktin,But we just got word you've decided to enter?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb."
Leslie Knope,"But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell."
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, lose a battle, win the war."
Leslie Knope,That kind of thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the way to go.
Elise Yarktin,Look.
Elise Yarktin,"The Pie Mary is retrogressive and misogynistic, and if you participate, we will have no choice but to protest you and Ben at the event."
Elise Yarktin,Hope you like pies... In your face.
Elise Yarktin,Metaphorically.
Elise Yarktin,We'll be civil.
Leslie Knope,Elise.
Leslie Knope,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights."
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, the oven's ready."
Ben Wyatt,"Chop chop, time to get bakin'."
Ben Wyatt,Daddy want pie.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ben Wyatt."
Ron Swanson,We have a wonderfully small number of clues.
Ron Swanson,One is this ticket.
Ron Swanson,Did you see this movie about vampires and such?
Donna Meagle,New Moon?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I saw it with April."
Donna Meagle,"She was so hopped up on painkillers from getting her wisdom teeth out, I convinced her to see it with me."
Ron Swanson,The teeth.
Ron Swanson,They're yours.
Donna Meagle,You were super out of it.
Donna Meagle,"You kept yelling ""Team Voldemort!"""
Donna Meagle,At the screen and we were kicked out.
Donna Meagle,I was furious.
Donna Meagle,You only get to see the second Twilight film for the seventh time once.
Ron Swanson,Do you remember anything about a key?
Ron Swanson,Or April doing anything unusual that day?
Donna Meagle,She did make us stop by the shoeshine stand before we left because she wanted to drop something off for Andy.
Donna Meagle,She had a real bad crush on him.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Babe.
Andy Dwyer,You had a crush on me.
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
April Ludgate,We're married.
Andy Dwyer,Still.
Ron Swanson,To the shoeshine stand!
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Chase me.
April Ludgate,Stop.
Donna Meagle,Garry?
Donna Meagle,What the hell are you doing?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, gosh."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I dropped my wedding ring down this grate, and then I was trying to get it out and I dropped my keys down there too, So I can't leave."
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this takes me back."
Donna Meagle,Mind if I stay and watch?
Jerry Gergich,Not at all.
Jerry Gergich,I appreciate the company.
Leslie Knope,The IOW does not mess around.
Leslie Knope,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them 100 dollars in their annual pledge."
Leslie Knope,Do you know how many anti-me signs that could buy?
Ben Wyatt,"You just don't do the pie contest, obviously."
Leslie Knope,Then we're just back where we started.
Leslie Knope,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.
Leslie Knope,What should we do?
Leslie Knope,Should we get a divorce?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,What if I register for the contest?
Ben Wyatt,I bake the pie.
Ben Wyatt,I act as my own wife.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that could work."
Leslie Knope,"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate."
Leslie Knope,And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.
Ben Wyatt,Exactly.
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is."
Leslie Knope,"I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, picture this... Crust on the bottom."
Ben Wyatt,Filling.
Ben Wyatt,Crust on top.
Ben Wyatt,What am I describing?
Leslie Knope,A pie.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"But you're in the right ""zone."""
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Calzone!
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Ben Wyatt,"Pies are just sweet calzones, honey."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm good at making calzones.
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Ben Wyatt,I can win this thing.
Leslie Knope,"Of course you can, baby."
Leslie Knope,Get in there and start baking.
Donna Meagle,I'm having some serious deja vu.
Donna Meagle,How many times have you lost your wedding ring?
Jerry Gergich,Too many times to count.
Jerry Gergich,And it causes real trouble with Gayle.
Jerry Gergich,"And any time I lose my ring, she turns into a real grumpy goose."
Donna Meagle,Is that so?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,"She'll say, you know, ""Garry, you'd lose your head if it wasn't screwed on tight."""
Jerry Gergich,And then she makes me go for the fresh oranges for the morning OJ.
Jerry Gergich,"And she says, ""Hey, Mr. Forgetful."""
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, those words... They rattle around here for hours."
Jerry Gergich,"That's why I've gotta be extra careful with this replacement ring, because if I lost--"
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna order us some dinner.
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand is gone.
Andy Dwyer,Or maybe it was never here.
Ron Swanson,They must have moved it during the remodel.
Ron Swanson,It's probably in basement storage.
Ron Swanson,To the basement!
Harris,Tighter.
Brett,"You sure, dude?"
Harris,"Yeah, dude."
Harris,Tighter.
Harris,I can do it.
Ron Swanson,"Do what, exactly?"
Harris,Nothing.
Harris,We're not doing anything.
Brett,And we definitely do not live down here now.
April Ludgate,"Guys, where's the old shoeshine stand from upstairs?"
Brett,We don't know anything about that.
Ron Swanson,"Boys, think."
Ron Swanson,We are on a quest and we are not leaving until we get an answer.
Harris,"Well, we're on our own quest, which is to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eyes bulge out a little bit, but not so tight that I die."
Andy Dwyer,I've been there.
Andy Dwyer,That's a real tightrope walk.
Brett,Oh!
Brett,Hey!
Brett,Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.
Brett,"It had black hair, but you could see through his skin."
Brett,"It didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster."
Harris,"Yeah, it said something about how it was worried Brett was gonna mug it."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,So we're looking for a racist ghost with black hair who likes shoeshines.
Ron Swanson,I think I have the answer.
Ron Swanson,The chase continues!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, wait."
Donna Meagle,"At the time that you told us you were mugged in the park, what were you reaching for in the river?"
Jerry Gergich,A burrito.
Donna Meagle,That's right.
Donna Meagle,You fell in the river reaching for a burrito.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am."
Jerry Gergich,That was not one of my finer moments.
Donna Meagle,Ooh.
Donna Meagle,It's getting late.
Donna Meagle,We need to bounce.
Donna Meagle,I can give you a ride.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Probably gonna get an earful when I get home tonight.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle might even call me the B word.
Jerry Gergich,"""Bozo."""
Donna Meagle,Wow.
Donna Meagle,We are very different people.
Ben Wyatt,Did you hear back from Elise?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We're good.
Leslie Knope,The IOW is not gonna protest us.
Leslie Knope,How's your pie?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't make a pie.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How is your dessert calzone?
Ben Wyatt,It's ready.
Ben Wyatt,"The question is, are they?"
Extra,"All right, our next contestant Is candidate Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie."
Extra,"Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt has baked up for us, shall we?"
Ben Wyatt,It's actually Ms. Knope.
Ben Wyatt,"And actually, right now it's Mr. Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie has her own busy life and I happen to be an excellent pie maker, so we figured we'd switch it up a bit."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, pack your suitcases, because we're going to a little town, Called Napoli In Italy."
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, free me from what?"
Kipp Bunthart,From the tyranny of women.
Kipp Bunthart,We are the Male Men.
Kipp Bunthart,"We are a men's rights activist group, and we are fed up."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's happening now?
Kipp Bunthart,Behind every successful woman is a man she has oppressed.
Kipp Bunthart,First Leslie Knope poaches her husband's campaign by making it all about her.
Kipp Bunthart,Now she's forcing him to bake pies and enter a contest for her?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,I'm not forcing him to do anything!
Leslie Knope,He loves to cook.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He has five personalized aprons.
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.
Kipp Bunthart,So I guess he was asking for it because of the way he was dressed?
Kipp Bunthart,We are sick and tired of this feminized society.
Kipp Bunthart,"Men have had a very rough go of it, for Just recently."
Kipp Bunthart,And it ends now.
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Marcia Langman,Leslie Knope exemplifies the feminist attack on our values.
Marcia Langman,"She could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my husband, Marshall."
Marshall Langman,Um.
Marshall Langman,Fierce alert.
Marshall Langman,"Eat 'em up, honey."
Elise Yarktin,The idea that feminism is an attack on family values is absurd.
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Joan Callamezzo,So you're defending Leslie Knope?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,Absolutely not.
Elise Yarktin,"Frankly, I don't think she's done enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy."
Joan Callamezzo,Let's turn now to Sasha Dunkirk.
Joan Callamezzo,She is head of the group Women Against Feminism.
Kipp Bunthart,What a surprise.
Kipp Bunthart,The woman is only talking to other women.
Kipp Bunthart,Can we have one conversation about feminism where men get to be in charge?
Sasha Dunkirk,I actually agree with him.
Kipp Bunthart,I don't need your pity.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Joan, Leslie Knope and I are united--"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Brandi Maxxxx,In our disgust of this week's events.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, if you're watching, I, Brandi Maxxxx, star of 69 Jump Street and Fifty Shaved Old Gays, have your back."
Jennifer Barkley,Oof.
Jennifer Barkley,"You really stepped in it this time, Knope."
Ben Wyatt,Why isn't the other candidate's wife being scrutinized like this?
Jennifer Barkley,Because June Hartwell is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.
Jennifer Barkley,"She started an awareness campaign called ""Bring a Sweater."""
Jennifer Barkley,"She calls it ""goose bump prevention."""
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on, you guys, you know the drill."
Jennifer Barkley,"Just ignore the fact that you're right, put on your blandest outfit-- So that one, hopefully, and then just go out there and publicly apologize."
Jennifer Barkley,Done.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Apologize for what?
Jennifer Barkley,Doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley,Just say you're sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,It's like taking a shot of tequila.
Jennifer Barkley,"You just gotta force it down, suddenly the world feels so much more pleasant."
Jennifer Barkley,I do three shots every time I have to enter this house.
Jerry Gergich,Donna.
Jerry Gergich,What are you doing here so early?
Donna Meagle,I come bearing gifts.
Donna Meagle,"First off, I got a dude in maintenance to open up that grate this morning."
Donna Meagle,"So here's your rings, keys, credit cards, and I found some heart medicine I assume is yours?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, no."
Jerry Gergich,That's mine.
Jerry Gergich,That's mine.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Donna Meagle,"Also, I thought I'd bring over some fresh oranges for you and Gayle."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that is just so kind, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,"You're one of a kind, Garry."
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Donna Meagle,"And I just wanna thank you for taking me down memory lane, ya big B word."
Donna Meagle,"""Buddy."""
Councilman Milton,So much has changed around here.
Councilman Milton,"I just wanted to remember the good old days, when a shoeshine was two bits, and there were no Mexicans in the music business."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't mind, Councilman Milton, we just need to search this stand."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,Found it.
Ron Swanson,"""Hi Andy, I hate people, but you are okay"""
Ron Swanson,"""It's weird."""
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,"""April."""
Andy Dwyer,"My God, babe, you were so into me."
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Ron Swanson,That's it.
April Ludgate,It's a dead end.
April Ludgate,No more clues.
Ron Swanson,See me in my office.
Andy Dwyer,"If it makes you feel any better, I had a big crush on you too."
April Ludgate,That does make me feel a little better.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Councilman Milton,Get off my boat!
Ben Wyatt,Good afternoon.
Ben Wyatt,I'm here today to share with you all my vision for the economic future of Southern Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,"But first, Leslie Knope, my wife, has a brief statement."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,How about this weather we're having?
Leslie Knope,Very temperate.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I made an attempt to--"
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,Stop.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, this whole thing just makes me queasy."
Ben Wyatt,"I love how independent my wife is, and because of that, I will not let her speak."
Ben Wyatt,That came out wrong.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, Leslie is a great mother, public servant, all-around person, and I am tired of everybody constantly telling her that she's making the wrong choice."
Ben Wyatt,"So you can say whatever you want, I couldn't care less about the political consequences."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman."
Leslie Knope,"Second, the Male Men. Where are you? Ah."
Leslie Knope,"You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me, and every other woman in this election, over the next few months."
Leslie Knope,"""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I just thought it would look better.
Leslie Knope,Or my kids got gum in it.
Leslie Knope,"""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense."
Leslie Knope,It's a stupid question.
Leslie Knope,Stop asking it.
Leslie Knope,Don't ask it.
Leslie Knope,"""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, sometimes I don't."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, no one's ever asked me that question."
Ben Wyatt,"No one asks me, ""Where are your kids?"" Or, ""Who's taking care of them?"" By the way, who is taking care of the kids right now?"
Leslie Knope,"My mom, babe."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"So, maybe Leslie doesn't fit your personal idea of what a candidate's wife should be."
Ben Wyatt,"So what? That's good, because there shouldn't be just one idea anyway."
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna bake a pie, that's great."
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna have a career, that's great, too."
Leslie Knope,"Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do.
Leslie Knope,We're all just trying to find the right path for us.
Leslie Knope,As individuals.
Leslie Knope,On this Earth.
Ben Wyatt,I'd say that's fifty-fifty boos and cheers.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That seems about right.
Kipp Bunthart,Let Ben speak! Let Ben speak!
Leslie Knope,He just spoke.
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.
Kipp Bunthart,Sorry.
Kipp Bunthart,I just got here.
Kipp Bunthart,I had a broken bike chain.
Kipp Bunthart,My bad.
April Ludgate,So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down.
April Ludgate,Great.
Ron Swanson,I change my house locks every 16 days.
Ron Swanson,That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you.
Ron Swanson,What matters is that I trust you and admire you as a person.
Ron Swanson,I will be sorry to see you leave this town.
Ron Swanson,For many reasons.
Ron Swanson,Not the least of which is that you created a puzzle that even I couldn't solve.
Ron Swanson,"And boy, oh, boy, did you love Andy."
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,It really is embarrassing.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I totally know where the key is.
Ron Swanson,How'd you remember?
April Ludgate,"""Woof, woof."" Bark."
Ron Swanson,Why here?
April Ludgate,Because this tree reminds me of you.
April Ludgate,It's strong.
April Ludgate,And quiet.
April Ludgate,And always here when you need it.
April Ludgate,Or whatever.
Ron Swanson,"I have always felt a certain kinship with April, and this is proof that I was correct."
Ron Swanson,"Not the nice things she said about me, the fact that I buried a large amount of gold under that same tree years ago."
Ron Swanson,I have since moved it.
Ron Swanson,Or have I?
Ben Wyatt,Elise?
Leslie Knope,What did I do wrong now?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,"Actually, we at the IOW loved what you said in your speech."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Elise Yarktin,"But... What we loved even more was how you, Ben, gave Leslie a platform in which to speak her mind."
Elise Yarktin,"Congratulations, Ben Wyatt, you are this year's IOW Woman of the Year."
Leslie Knope,Son of a bitch.
