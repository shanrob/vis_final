Ben Wyatt,"So, while they repaint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking."
Donna Meagle,I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everyone is."
Ben Wyatt,I'm doing it.
Donna Meagle,'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, moving on to recycling."
Ben Wyatt,"You okay, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Just a little tooth pain.
Ron Swanson,I'm fine.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each department will be getting blue bins Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I don't like dentists.
Ron Swanson,Just a second.
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no!"
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Donna Meagle,What the?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, everybody."
Ron Swanson,What were we talking about?
Ron Swanson,Recycling?
Ron Swanson,Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
Ron Swanson,But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint."
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody!"
April Ludgate,"Everybody, listen up."
Andy Dwyer,"You are all officially invited to a dinner party, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home."
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,There's no more left.
Andy Dwyer,Give it to him.
April Ludgate,"We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special."
Andy Dwyer,"And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties."
April Ludgate,Parties.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Andy Dwyer,"Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot."
Andy Dwyer,Don't be late.
April Ludgate,Watch out.
Tom Haverford,"""Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."""
Donna Meagle,"""Please bring cooked steak."""
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,They're young.
Leslie Knope,They're in love.
Leslie Knope,They're ready to show it to the world.
Leslie Knope,It's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,And we're all going.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,You going tonight?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3D glasses, and a 3D capable television."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will see you there, with all of those things."
Leslie Knope,I was actually coming to see you.
Leslie Knope,I wanted your advice on something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Ben Wyatt,"My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week."
Ben Wyatt,"But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him."
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna do that?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,I've been moving around so much the past few years.
Ben Wyatt,It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is a great city."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government."
Ben Wyatt,So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or?
Leslie Knope,It's a tough call.
Leslie Knope,You know what I would do?
Leslie Knope,You should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,That always works for me.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, maybe I'll do that."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Nice talking to you.
Ben Wyatt,Good stuff.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,So how does this work?
Extra,"All right, you just fill out your name tag, and you're all set."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or?"
Extra,Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
Jerry Gergich,"So be honest, what do you guys think?"
Tom Haverford,"You know what, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,"I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due."
Tom Haverford,"You know, I like how the Damn it."
Tom Haverford,I was so close.
Tom Haverford,It's a terrible shirt.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,April's friend Orin is here.
Leslie Knope,He's very intense and very weird.
Leslie Knope,"So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, gang."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What'd you bring?
Chris Traeger,I was in charge of the cake.
Chris Traeger,"To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf."
Chris Traeger,"You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction."
Ron Swanson,But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
Leslie Knope,"No, a cake, but this is so much healthier."
Ron Swanson,"So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake."
Leslie Knope,"Take a walk, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ann Perkins,Donna.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I am so excited to see you here.
Ann Perkins,These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
Ann Perkins,What?
Donna Meagle,Do you know where you are right now?
Donna Meagle,We're in the jungle.
Donna Meagle,There are no friends here.
Donna Meagle,It's every woman for herself.
Ann Perkins,"You're joking, right?"
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I'm joking?
Donna Meagle,Dating is a zerosum game.
Donna Meagle,"If you get a man, I don't get that man."
Ann Perkins,I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Donna Meagle,Here's some more advice.
Donna Meagle,Beat it.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking about it.
Tom Haverford,"Well, you are a huge nerd."
Tom Haverford,"But I'd be sorry to see you go, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this party needs a little help."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Tom Haverford,"So are you going on, like, a yearIong walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?"
Ben Wyatt,"To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation."
Ben Wyatt,So you can put that one away.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out."
Andy Dwyer,Totally agree.
Andy Dwyer,Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,What do you think?
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're not supposed to let me see you."
April Ludgate,"No, come on."
April Ludgate,You have to look.
April Ludgate,This is important.
April Ludgate,You have to tell me if I look good.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Andy Dwyer,Uh It's supposed to be a big surprise.
Andy Dwyer,"But tonight, me and April are getting married."
Andy Dwyer,To each other.
Leslie Knope,Is April pregnant?
Leslie Knope,Are you pregnant?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Yes?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,Are you terminal?
Leslie Knope,Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,God.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,Why is this great thing happening?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story."
Andy Dwyer,We were hanging out.
Andy Dwyer,"And suddenly, I was like, ""What if we got married tomorrow?"""
Andy Dwyer,"And she was like ""Fine."""
Andy Dwyer,"She's like, ""Fine."
Leslie Knope,That is a great story.
Leslie Knope,"But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live."
April Ludgate,"We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Like, a house or, like, a condo or something."
Andy Dwyer,Probably a condo.
Leslie Knope,You can't just get a condo.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,House.
Leslie Knope,I love Andy and April as a couple.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together forever.
Leslie Knope,But relationships need planning.
Leslie Knope,You just can't jump into something without thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!"
Leslie Knope,Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,Secret wedding.
Tom Haverford,Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Ron Swanson,Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them."
Ron Swanson,It's not really my place.
Ron Swanson,Or yours.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Extra,Brian.
Ann Perkins,What's your occupation?
Extra,I'm a manager at a sporting goods store.
Ann Perkins,No way.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Extra,Seriously?
Extra,Which one?
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Ann Perkins,I was just ribbing you.
Extra,What are you drinking?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Extra,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,I couldn't hear you.
Extra,"So you just laughed and said, ""Yeah""?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Excuse us.
Donna Meagle,That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Donna Meagle,Did you grow up in the woods?
Donna Meagle,Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
Ann Perkins,I told you I'm rusty.
Donna Meagle,"All right, come with me."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, something just occurred to me."
Tom Haverford,Can I be your best man?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, dude, totally."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,My best man.
Tom Haverford,Best man!
Tom Haverford,One of my life goals is to be a best man.
Tom Haverford,It's a baller position.
Tom Haverford,You get drunk.
Tom Haverford,You make speeches.
Tom Haverford,"And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing, from behind."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do."
Leslie Knope,"I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before."
Leslie Knope,But you know what would be fun?
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,"Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together."
Leslie Knope,It'll be a blast.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, relax."
Leslie Knope,You relax.
Leslie Knope,You relax all the way home and get into bed.
Leslie Knope,You need to go to bed.
Andy Dwyer,April.
Andy Dwyer,Girl talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's your middle name?"
Andy Dwyer,The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
Leslie Knope,You don't know each other's middle names?
April Ludgate,I don't wanna say it out loud.
Andy Dwyer,Ew.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,Roberta!
April Ludgate,Such a loser.
April Ludgate,Can't believe I'm marrying him.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
April Ludgate,I'm going to.
April Ludgate,And then I'm gonna divorce him.
April Ludgate,Then I'm gonna marry him again.
Leslie Knope,"One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours."
Leslie Knope,And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
Leslie Knope,And he was married.
Leslie Knope,But the clothes thing really bothered me.
Donna Meagle,You always wanna scribble the name.
Donna Meagle,Make 'em read.
Donna Meagle,Draw them in.
Donna Meagle,Make 'em work for it.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Donna Meagle,Two shots of Jameson.
Donna Meagle,Don't make too much eye contact.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna seem available, but not too available."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,I think I'm good for now.
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna... Yeah.
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, man."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be one of my best men?
Ron Swanson,"I'd be honored to, son."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, you helped me get April back."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be my best man?
Chris Traeger,Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,This shirt is hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,"Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?"
Tom Haverford,"Got a little competition for the best man, huh?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, you know what the best best man does."
Tom Haverford,Excuse me!
Tom Haverford,Are there any strippers here?
Tom Haverford,Former strippers?
Tom Haverford,Nondancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
Tom Haverford,It's my duty as best man.
Ron Swanson,The wedding's in four minutes.
Tom Haverford,It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are getting married tonight.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"I need you to get down here, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"Help me, please!"
Leslie Knope,Relationships are like scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,"If you come up too fast, you get the bends."
Leslie Knope,"And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends."
Ben Wyatt,"No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Are you asking me or telling me?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are about to get married.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,Should I change my Brita filter?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It depends on how frequently you use it.
Ben Wyatt,True.
Leslie Knope,"Stay focused, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through."
Leslie Knope,And nobody seems concerned about this.
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Mesdames and Missoirs.
Andy Dwyer,"If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence."
Ron Swanson,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Big event in that room, 15 minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is really happening.
Leslie Knope,I love April and Andy.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party."
Andy Dwyer,You're at our wedding.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate."
April Ludgate,I guess I kind of hate most things.
April Ludgate,But I never really seem to hate you.
April Ludgate,"So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you."
April Ludgate,Is that cool?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Is it my turn?
Extra,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"""April, you're the most awesome person ""I have ever known in my entire life."
Andy Dwyer,"""I vow to protect you from danger."""
Andy Dwyer,"""I don't care if I have to fight an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him, your mom, I would take 'em down."""
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm telling you.
April Ludgate,It's okay.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you."
Andy Dwyer,And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
Extra,And now the rings.
Extra,"By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Brett,Go fly away.
Harris,Fly!
Harris,Fly!
Brett,Wings of love.
Brett,Okay.
Brett,All right.
Brett,So that one is dead.
Brett,We know that.
Ron Swanson,"You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know."
Leslie Knope,I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
Ron Swanson,"But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered."
Ron Swanson,Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
Leslie Knope,They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I got married twice."
Ron Swanson,"Both times, I was a lot older than those two."
Ron Swanson,And both marriages ended in divorce And a burning effigy.
Ron Swanson,Who's to say what works?
Ron Swanson,"You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice."
Ron Swanson,That's all anybody can do.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Weren't you married three times?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God, you're right."
Ron Swanson,I get to burn another effigy.
Ron Swanson,The key to burning an exwife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Ron Swanson,Do not stand too close when you light an exwife effigy.
Natalie Ludgate,"My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool."
Natalie Ludgate,I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Natalie Ludgate,"Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it."
Natalie Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,That was beautiful.
Extra,"You two remind me of me and my husband, George."
Tom Haverford,I gotta nail the speech.
Tom Haverford,So I brought in an expert.
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?"
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, this is what I would do."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I would start with a joke.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously."
Tom Haverford,Swingers or Crashers?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Fred Claus.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Quote from Love Actually.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold back your tears.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Pause.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Drop the microphone.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get out of that bitch.
Extra,"I wish you the best of luck, to both of you."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Grandma."
Andy Dwyer,How could anyone ever possibly top that?
Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,"So, thank you all for all the talking."
Andy Dwyer,"Let's just get back to dancing, huh?"
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"See you around, maybe."
Donna Meagle,"That went better, right?"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, it did."
Ann Perkins,"However, he proudly told me that he ""beat herpes."""
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Donna."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go home.
Ann Perkins,I just found out Andy's getting married.
Donna Meagle,So?
Ann Perkins,So that's my ex-boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,We were together for a really long time.
Donna Meagle,All right.
Ann Perkins,What?
Donna Meagle,"What? Listen, you are a hot, young doctor."
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, actually."
Donna Meagle,"Okay, I don't know you."
Donna Meagle,But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Donna Meagle,"Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry? Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy, who has been looking at you, and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself? All right."
Andy Dwyer,"I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr. Tom Haverford."
Andy Dwyer,Oh! Coolest guy I know.
Andy Dwyer,"And, ladies, he's single, I think."
Andy Dwyer,"You're not still married, are you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Andy Dwyer,But you... You're straight?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah! Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married! This is crazy."
Andy Dwyer,"What happened? But, seriously, life is short, right? Uh, just I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy."
Andy Dwyer,That's what April and I did.
Andy Dwyer,We are in love.
Andy Dwyer,So we didn't overthink it.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this."
Andy Dwyer,"Am I right? All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you, April Roberta Ludgate."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
April Ludgate,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, yeah Oh, Grandma April, there's so little time The things I really want to do Let's fly to the sky It's so awesome"
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,Mortality.
Chris Traeger,"See, I like to take each day at a time."
Chris Traeger,There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
Orin,I have to go.
Chris Traeger,It's been great talking to you.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna say another word.
Leslie Knope,This is your day.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I'm really glad you're here.
April Ludgate,"I think you're awesome, and I love you."
Harris,"What's the deal with that hot girl, April?"
Ben Wyatt,What's the deal with her?
Harris,Yeah.
Harris,"Like, is she good to go? Like, is she down to clown?"
Ben Wyatt,She's married.
Ben Wyatt,"She got married, like, 20 minutes ago."
Harris,"Oh, my God."
Harris,That's the same girl from the thing.
Ben Wyatt,"From the wedding ceremony, yeah."
Harris,"All the good ones are taken, huh, bro?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You should stay.
Leslie Knope,Don't go back to Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,You should stay here.
Ben Wyatt,You think?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's a great city here, you know? And there are great people."
Leslie Knope,And you've made a lot of friends.
Leslie Knope,And what are you gonna do? You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets? Stay here.
Leslie Knope,Help us build something.
Ben Wyatt,I already accepted the job.
Ben Wyatt,I'm staying here.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think so."
Ben Wyatt,"Orin's behind me, isn't he?"
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.

Ann Perkins,"""Hope we can get together soon."""
Donna Meagle,"Okay, now you write, ""Who is this?"""
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy."
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,How you guys doing?
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're on our honeymoon."

Andy Dwyer,"Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,So bad.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna divorce you.
April Ludgate,Andy sucks at driving a boat.
April Ludgate,"And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now."
Ron Swanson,"Well, they're still together."
Ron Swanson,You owe me 20 bucks.
