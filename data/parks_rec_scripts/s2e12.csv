Leslie Knope,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk skedge, guys."
Leslie Knope,"The kids are gonna come at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, and everyone's gonna do Santa for two hours, so I would just advise everyone, before you get in your costume, to go to the bathroom, so we can avoid what happened last year."

Andy Dwyer,You got that?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Dexhart?
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Councilman Dexhart,Thank you for meeting me.
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I am assuming this is about my performance in the Government Follies last night.
Leslie Knope,"I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for, except for perhaps being too incisive."
Councilman Dexhart,I don't want you to apologize.
Councilman Dexhart,I want to know who told you.
Leslie Knope,Who told me?
Councilman Dexhart,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Nobody told me nothing!
Leslie Knope,What are we talking about?
Councilman Dexhart,"Based on that skit, I know you heard about the new scandal that's about to break."
Councilman Dexhart,Who told you?
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the babysitter?
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
Leslie Knope,What?
Councilman Dexhart,"All right, stop playing dumb."
Councilman Dexhart,You know damn well what happened.
Councilman Dexhart,"I got the babysitter pregnant, then when she was in the delivery room, I had sex with not one, but four nurses in a supply closet, as well as a woman whose husband was getting a liver transplant."
Councilman Dexhart,Mmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"Now, which one of them told you?"
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the liver lady?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I-- No one-- I haven't-- I haven't heard any of this, ever, in my whole life."
Councilman Dexhart,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Believe me, I would have remembered this."
Councilman Dexhart,Okay.
Councilman Dexhart,"Well, in that case, everything I just told you was just a funny prank."
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Hi!
Tom Haverford,How was your meeting?
Leslie Knope,It was fine.
Leslie Knope,Pretty straightforward.
Leslie Knope,Short meeting.
Leslie Knope,He's a busy guy.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, very busy."
Tom Haverford,Look at this article.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What the--
Perd Hapley,The story of this story is that it won't stop developing.
Perd Hapley,The mystery woman who met with Councilman Dexhart last night appears to be a government employee named Leslie Norp.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Perd Hapley,"According to unconfirmed reports in the Pawnee Sun, the two bent an elbow at this local watering hole, and although they left separately, no one knows where they woke up together."
Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four News."
Leslie Knope,All I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's the Pawnee Sun."
Ann Perkins,It's a tabloid.
Ann Perkins,Nobody else has written about it.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, no one believes that garbage."
Tom Haverford,Nobody even reads that thing.
Donna Meagle,Leslie!
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,"Nice work, girl."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,How do I fight back?
Leslie Knope,Give me some options.
April Ludgate,Do you want me to seduce Perd Hapley?
Leslie Knope,How would that help?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I just want to see if I can do it.
Leslie Knope,"April, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something worth losing your virginity over."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I don't know if this is important or not, but I have heard a lot of very, very interesting chatter around the shoeshine stand today."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,What have you heard?
Andy Dwyer,A lot of things.
Andy Dwyer,"Like, ""Can you believe it?"""
Andy Dwyer,"and, ""The Parks lady boned Dexhart,"" and, ""Of course she did, she's totally good to go."""
Andy Dwyer,"And one guy was like, ""I wouldn't hit that."""
Andy Dwyer,"And the other guy was like, ""Me neither."""
Andy Dwyer,"And then this third guy was like, ""I would."""
Andy Dwyer,So I don't know if that's helpful at all.
Leslie Knope,"Well, keep your ear to the ground."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I'll justâ¦
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do my job.
Leslie Knope,I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like this.
Leslie Knope,Except I always assumed that I would be the politician and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
Leslie Knope,"And that man would be the vice president, and I would be the president."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look good."
Leslie Knope,"You need to put some tights on, though, and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline nice and high."
Alexa Softcastle,Leslie Knope?
Alexa Softcastle,"Alexa Softcastle, Pawnee Sun."
Alexa Softcastle,Can I ask you a few questions?
Ron Swanson,Don't say anything.
Leslie Knope,I'm not afraid to say anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I have nothing to hide.
Leslie Knope,"I'd never even met Councilman Dexhart before yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about the matter."
Alexa Softcastle,Some people are saying this isn't the first time that you've had sex with a married councilman.
Leslie Knope,Who's saying that?
Alexa Softcastle,Some people.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,This interview is over.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Go home, lay low."
Mark Brendanawicz,The truth will come out.
Leslie Knope,I can't!
Leslie Knope,I have too much work to do.
Leslie Knope,This department is not gonna deputy direct itself.
Ron Swanson,I think we can manage.
Ron Swanson,Just give me your schedule and we'll cover for you.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"I've made copies of Leslie's daily work schedule, so we'll just split into teams, and each team will take..."
Ron Swanson,"Damn, 10 items, and we'll knock this out."
Leslie Knope,"I swear to you, I never even met the guy before last night."
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,I believe you.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Dave Sanderson,'Course.
Dave Sanderson,"I think I know you pretty well, and that doesn't sound like you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Dave Sanderson,"If I ever see that guy, I'm gonna punch him right in the face."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's sweet."
Leslie Knope,Use your nightstick.
Ron Swanson,Which meeting is this?
April Ludgate,Reorganization of Local Auditing Systems.
Ron Swanson,Kill me.
Paul,Right.
Paul,First order of business.
Paul,Leslie?
Paul,Where's Leslie?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, um, I gave her the day off, Paul."
Ron Swanson,Thought that was best.
Paul,"Oh, yeah."
Paul,That's good.
Paul,"So you'll be making the presentation then, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, so, that kind of brings us to what I wanted to talk to you about."
Dave Sanderson,You know my Army reserve unit?
Dave Sanderson,We got called up to active duty.
Dave Sanderson,I ship out in four days.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where you going?
Dave Sanderson,San Diego.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Dave Sanderson,It's not dangerous.
Dave Sanderson,It's mostly maintenance.
Dave Sanderson,"But I'm going for, like, a year."
Dave Sanderson,Maybe 18 months.
Dave Sanderson,And I was kind of hoping that maybe you'd want to come with me.
Dave Sanderson,"Like, on a permanent type basis."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, I don't know, it's kind of a weird question."
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, I joined to put myself through college, and it's, you know, I'm just a desk jockey, but it's still, it's rewarding."
Dave Sanderson,"So, yeah, I guess I'm in love with the Army."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, Leslie?"
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, that makes a lot more sense."
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, I'm definitely in love with Leslie."
Dave Sanderson,That's affirmative.
Dave Sanderson,"I know this seems kind of fast, but I feel like we got something here."
Leslie Knope,"I do, too."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,You don't have to answer right away.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you kind of do."
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, I need to know soon."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna go?
Leslie Knope,This whole Dexhart thing is not making me feel very attached to Pawnee right now.
Ann Perkins,San Diego.
Ann Perkins,Geez.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You could learn how to surf.
Leslie Knope,I know how to surf.
Leslie Knope,I took lessons when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually pretty good.
Ann Perkins,I bet you are.
Ann Perkins,I would miss Leslie like crazy.
Leslie Knope,Aw!
Tom Haverford,"All right, sorted out that payroll issue, this is done."
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of beer to Sanitation."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Tom Haverford,Let's skip that one.
Tom Haverford,They can buy their own beer.
Tom Haverford,I'm getting hungry.
Tom Haverford,Let's get something to eat.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, have you figured out what you're getting Ann for Christmas?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I got her a pretty great computer bag."
Tom Haverford,Yeah?
Tom Haverford,That's a terrible gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, Tom, she needs one."
Mark Brendanawicz,"She mentioned it to me two months ago, and I wrote it down."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's what's called being an amazing boyfriend.
Tom Haverford,Have you seen Ann?
Tom Haverford,You know how hot she is?
Tom Haverford,"Men give women of that caliber speedboats, private jets, not computer bags."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do you think I should get her?
Tom Haverford,Diamonds.
Tom Haverford,Can't go wrong with diamonds.
Mark Brendanawicz,Diamonds?
Tom Haverford,There isn't a woman alive who doesn't love diamonds.
Tom Haverford,"Even the super left wing chicks that saw Blood Diamond and cried, when they get a diamond, they're like, ""Yeah, bitch, give me more of them blood diamonds!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Make them extra bloody."""
Tom Haverford,Trust me.
Joan Callamezzo,We are here looking at a videotape.
Joan Callamezzo,This is back in April 2005.
Joan Callamezzo,We're looking at Councilman Dexhartâ¦
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you should see this."
Joan Callamezzo,"And he's now about to shake hands with Leslie Knope, the alleged sex toy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, for cripes sake!"
Extra,Look at the way she's smiling at him.
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Extra,And then almost unconsciously touching her hands to her hips.
Extra,See that?
Extra,Right there.
Extra,It's like she's sending him a message that she's ready for childbearing.
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"In a 24 hour news cycle, the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again."
Leslie Knope,"In 2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year."
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics."
Ann Perkins,It was way too easy to get this guy here.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough."
Leslie Knope,I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.
Councilman Dexhart,"Mmm, no, thanks."
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Ann Perkins,What's in it for you?
Councilman Dexhart,"To be honest, being linked to Leslie is a lot less damning than the real story."
Councilman Dexhart,You're like a glass of whole milk.
Councilman Dexhart,"What are you, Lutheran?"
Councilman Dexhart,I love Lutherans.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story."
Councilman Dexhart,It won't do you any good.
Councilman Dexhart,"Take it from me, denying only makes things worse."
Councilman Dexhart,"Listen, I gotta go."
Councilman Dexhart,I'm expected at two different maternity wards.
Councilman Dexhart,"But before I go, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask."
Councilman Dexhart,Should we?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Councilman Dexhart,People already think we did it.
Councilman Dexhart,You've got nothing to lose.
Councilman Dexhart,I'm very good.
Leslie Knope,Get out of here!
Councilman Dexhart,"All right, fine."
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about your gay boyfriend all day.
Andy Dwyer,I have got some awesome ideas.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"First idea, spray tan gift certificates."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Trip to Germany?
Andy Dwyer,Germany is awesome.
April Ludgate,And expensive.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think of that.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you know how people say that you should give gifts that you would want to get yourself?"
April Ludgate,What would you want?
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,"Indianapolis Colts' Reggie Wayne jersey, number 87, double XL, home blue, signed by Reggie Wayne right after he catches a touchdown to win the Super Bowl."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Never mind.
Andy Dwyer,No?
Andy Dwyer,Hip Hop Abs dance fitness DVD?
Joan Callamezzo,We just received these exclusive photos.
Joan Callamezzo,We have pictures of City Councilman Dexhartâ¦
Ann Perkins,My God!
Joan Callamezzo,...with Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe it!
Extra,"The big issue now is, who is this mystery woman?"
Extra,"She and Knope are standing very close to each other, and any time you see two women standing very close to each otherâ¦"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, don't say it."
Extra,you immediately assumeâ¦
Ann Perkins,Please don't say it.
Extra,lesbian.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, of course."
Leslie Knope,What?
Joan Callamezzo,It is a veritable storm of information coming into the studios here today.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope, and I would like Joan to clear all of her guests tomorrow, because I'm coming on the show."
Leslie Knope,"If you think that you can drag me and my friend through the mud, then you've got-- Yes, I'll hold."
Ron Swanson,Unbelievable.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Tom Haverford,What happened?
Ron Swanson,Got a call from some panicky morning joggers.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Sanitation didn't empty this dumpster."
Ron Swanson,To the raccoons' delight.
April Ludgate,I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
Ron Swanson,"Not in this town, sweetheart."
Ron Swanson,"In this town, they're 24/ 7."
Ron Swanson,We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.
Ron Swanson,They'll hunt the kids for sport.
Ron Swanson,"Fess up, guys."
Ron Swanson,Who dropped the ball?
Tom Haverford,"""Bring a case of beer to Sanitation."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of"" Yeah, this one's our fault, Ron, and we will take care of this for you."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews, and teach crafts at the senior center."
Ron Swanson,Simultaneously.
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be on your show."
Leslie Knope,I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, sure."
Joan Callamezzo,I see you brought your girlfriend for support.
Joan Callamezzo,That's nice.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,She's not myâ¦
Extra,"And in five, Joan."
Leslie Knope,She's a--
Extra,We're Four.
Extra,Three.
Leslie Knope,You've got it wrong.
Joan Callamezzo,Sex.
Joan Callamezzo,"Drugs, possibly."
Joan Callamezzo,Rock and Roll?
Joan Callamezzo,"We'll find out, on Pawnee Today's exclusive interview with the woman at the center of the Dexhart sex scandal, Leslie Knope."
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, my first question has to be, when did the affair start?"
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night."
Leslie Knope,"We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Leslie, we all saw the tape from four years ago, and you were flashing some serious ""do me"" eyes."
Joan Callamezzo,That's just my opinion.
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
Leslie Knope,You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart.
Joan Callamezzo,You know what? That's a really good idea.
Joan Callamezzo,"Let's bring him out! Councilman, come on out!"
Councilman Dexhart,"Hi, sweetie."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
Joan Callamezzo,I thought it'd be more exciting!
Councilman Dexhart,You look great.
Joan Callamezzo,It's like I'm invisible.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, my name is Ron."
Ron Swanson,You don't need to know my last name.
Ron Swanson,"Whoever wants to talk, go ahead, and we'll be out of here in a tight 15."
Gretel,"I found a sandwich in one of your parks, and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise."
Gretel,What's so funny?
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Extra,"Yeah, I don't think kids should be allowed on the playground equipment."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,We've been over this.
Ron Swanson,"If you're worried about swine flu, use hand sanitizer--"
Extra,I'm not worried about swine flu.
Extra,I already have the swine flu.
Extra,I'm worried about the turtle flu.
Ron Swanson,The turtle flu?
Extra,Turtle flu.
Ron Swanson,Turtle flu.
Councilman Dexhart,"Joan, this whole Pawnee Sun story is ""gotcha journalism"" at its worst."
Councilman Dexhart,"Honey, let's just keep our private life in the bedroom where it belongs."
Leslie Knope,"We do not have a private life! Stop saying that we have a private life! The fact is, we never slept together, and if we did, you would have proof, and we would have seen it by now."
Joan Callamezzo,Councilman?
Councilman Dexhart,I can prove it.
Councilman Dexhart,She has a mole on her right buttock.
Leslie Knope,What? That is a total lie.
Leslie Knope,You've never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,He has never seen my butt.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, I guess it's your word against his."
Councilman Dexhart,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Here, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you look for yourself?
Joan Callamezzo,Is this happening? Wait.
Joan Callamezzo,There's no mole.
Joan Callamezzo,There is no mole.
Joan Callamezzo,"This exclusive story, there is no mole on Miss Knope!"
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it's come to this.
Leslie Knope,This is utterly humiliating.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Councilman? Care to make a comment about No-Mole-Gate?"
Councilman Dexhart,Yes.
Councilman Dexhart,"I really didn't think that Miss Knope would pull down her pants on TV, but since she did, I will admit that the rumors of our affair are indeed false."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Councilman Dexhart,"However, I have no plans to resign."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,You know what? You're a class act.
Councilman Dexhart,Thank you.
Dave Sanderson,I thought you did great.
Dave Sanderson,"When you get all feisty like that, it gets my heart racing."
Dave Sanderson,"Like I'm on a Stairmaster, except more, like, in a sexual... Context."
Leslie Knope,I can't go to San Diego with you.
Leslie Knope,My life is here.
Leslie Knope,"My friends, my career."
Dave Sanderson,"I guess I just thought with everything that happened, you'd want a fresh start."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I really care about you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,I just-- I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,You want your ticket back?
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,You know what? Keep it.
Dave Sanderson,"You may want to come visit me, right? There's a 75 dollar change fee, but I could pay you that, or I could reimburse you."
Dave Sanderson,There's a lot of ways we could handle that.
Andy Dwyer,Oh! Oh! That's--
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Honey.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, I'm so proud of you."
Tom Haverford,Leslie Knope!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That took guts, mooning Joan Callamezzo! Aw! Honey!"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Is something wrong with the tree?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,But it's almost 9:00.
Leslie Knope,It should've been lighted up an hour ago.
Ron Swanson,We waited for you.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, everybody."
Ron Swanson,Count down.
All,Five! Four! Three! Two! One!
Leslie Knope,It's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
Leslie Knope,You think Winston Churchill ever had to pull his pants down and show his butt? No.
Leslie Knope,But would he have? Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, could he have? Well, maybe not towards the end of his life, but he would have."
Leslie Knope,Because he loved his job.
Andy Dwyer,Reggie Wayne!
Ann Perkins,Dude! You remembered me complaining about my computer bag!
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you like it?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Ann Perkins,It's way better than the gift that I got you.
Ann Perkins,It's Pacers tickets.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!
Ann Perkins,They're not even good seats!
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Mark Brendanawicz,This is awesome!
Ann Perkins,It's not awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,I actually got you a second gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,You don't have to come to this game with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,You don't have to.
Ann Perkins,That's the nicest gift anybody's ever gotten me in my life!
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Mark Brendanawicz,Come here.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, thank God!"
Ron Swanson,There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope in the Parks Department."
