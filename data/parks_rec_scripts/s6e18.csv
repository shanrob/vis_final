Andy Dwyer,"I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we can handle that."
Andy Dwyer,I do have one question.
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my Sorry."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Are you getting sick?
Leslie Knope,"It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick."
Leslie Knope,Stock up on Kleenex.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch your face.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch anything.
Leslie Knope,People are dropping like flies.
Leslie Knope,We already had to quarantine Larry.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I don't feel good."
Jerry Gergich,Can't I just work from home?
Leslie Knope,"The tent is your home now, Larry."
Leslie Knope,We already forwarded your mail.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, well, here's something that's going to make you feel really good."
Andy Dwyer,Guess who I just secured as the headliner for the Unity Concert.
Andy Dwyer,Chipp McCapp!
Leslie Knope,No!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, I don't want to touch your hand."
Leslie Knope,Chipp McCapp is the most amazing 17 year old country singer in the entire world.
Leslie Knope,He's like Indiana's sweetheart.
Andy Dwyer,We are huge Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,That's what his fans call themselves.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,Because of the animal?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's too simple."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom parentheses Support the Troops has, like, two million hits on YouTube."
Chipp McCapp,"She don't care about no fancy trends She's just a mom from old South Bend Get home safe, boys, and thank you for protecting our freedom."
Andy Dwyer,Let's play it again.
Leslie Knope,Play it again.
Tom Haverford,"Today at a local vineyard, a bunch of sommeliers, AKA wine experts, are going to be competing for their certification."
Tom Haverford,I'm going to hire the best one at my new restaurant.
Tom Haverford,Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,People that convince other people to buy expensive stuff they don't need.
Tom Haverford,Those are the real heroes.
Tom Haverford,Donna.
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,Wine Country train is leaving the station.
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to come.
Craig Middlebrooks,I love wine and everything about it.
Craig Middlebrooks,"The soil, the vines."
Craig Middlebrooks,I studied botany for three years at Purdue University.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Go, Boilermakers!"
Ron Swanson,"There will be alcohol there, so I will go, as well."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe I'll tag along."
Ben Wyatt,I don't have anymore work to do.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it will be relaxing.
Tom Haverford,I didn't invite any of you.
Tom Haverford,I started with two cool people and I ended up with a bunch of grandpas.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, grandpas."
Tom Haverford,"When we get to the vineyard, there'll be a lot of fancy people there."
Tom Haverford,"Please, I beg you, don't embarrass me."
Ben Wyatt,How would we embarrass you?
Tom Haverford,You're already doing it.
Tom Haverford,I begged you.
Andy Dwyer,"I guess, now that we've got Chipp McCapp as our headliner, I can get rid of my awesome wish list."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, those are long shots."
Leslie Knope,"""Bob Dylan's friends?"""
Andy Dwyer,I just thought maybe they could get Bob Dylan to come.
Leslie Knope,Land Ho.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love them."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,But there's no way they're getting back together.
Leslie Knope,Their lead singer split 10 years ago.
Leslie Knope,He titled their last album We'll Never Reunite.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Back in your tent, sicky."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, but Chipp McCapp's manager called."
Jerry Gergich,He has to drop out.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need all hands on deck."
Leslie Knope,There are no hands to be on deck because everybody's at the winery.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, you and I need to handle this."
Leslie Knope,We need to be operating at maximum
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Larry!"
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"Xander, my mander."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Owner, operator, and global ambassador for Tom's Bistro, opening this spring in Pawnee."
Xander,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Donna Meagle,Damn.
Donna Meagle,Look at that tie dimple.
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Tom Haverford,My main target for Tom's Bistro?
Tom Haverford,Xander Truffant.
Tom Haverford,He's the best young somm in the game.
Tom Haverford,I don't say this lightly.
Tom Haverford,He's basically the Bruno Mars of Indiana amateur wine tasting.
Xander,"If you'll excuse me, I must prepare for the tasting competition."
Xander,I pour saline water through my nose to clear the mucus from my smell centers.
Tom Haverford,That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,It costs 200 dollars to get certified.
April Ludgate,I wanted to make fun of stupid people while I get drunk.
April Ludgate,My two true passions.
Donna Meagle,You want to futz with these fools?
Donna Meagle,I will bankroll you.
April Ludgate,Really?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, yeah, pimp."
Donna Meagle,Sounds like fun.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"April Ludgate, professional drinker."
Extra,"Uh, where did you study, Ms. Ludgate?"
April Ludgate,The Wine Academy.
Extra,The Wine Academy?
Extra,In Bordeaux?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Extra,"Carol, make sure she's in Group A."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Uh, excuse me."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want in, too."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I know I don't look the part, but I know everything about wine and I will prove it."
Craig Middlebrooks,"My name is Craig Middlebrooks, and this is my debit rewards card."
Ben Wyatt,"Why wouldn't you run this by me first, Dad?"
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, just weird family business."
Ron Swanson,Sounds private.
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss it with me.
Ben Wyatt,"My parents had this small, little vacation house on Lake Hubbard."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, they've sold it without telling the rest of us."
Ron Swanson,Did you not hear me say there was no need to discuss it with me?
Ben Wyatt,My dad sent me this check out of the blue.
Ben Wyatt,My share of the profits.
Ben Wyatt,It's so disrespectful to the family structure--
Ron Swanson,Maybe a drink will help.
Ron Swanson,Put some alcohol in your mouth to block the words from coming out.
Extra,Some of our blueberry wine?
Extra,We make it right here at the vineyard.
Ron Swanson,I don't drink alcohol from that portion of the color spectrum.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, that's strong."
Ben Wyatt,"Holy hell, that's a lot of alcohol."
Ron Swanson,"We will take four bottles, please, and thank you."
Leslie Knope,"All we need to do is go to Indianapolis, convince Chipp to do the festival and then, you know, head home."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure you're feeling up for this, boss?"
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I've had the flu before, and I worked through it."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, if you do collapse, luckily, I know first aid."
Andy Dwyer,Or karate.
Leslie Knope,That's not first aid.
Andy Dwyer,It is if you do it right.
Andy Dwyer,Heimlich!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I guess while you get your medicine, I'll just stroll through the candy aisles, but won't get any."
Leslie Knope,You can buy two candies.
Andy Dwyer,Two?
Extra,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,I have the flu.
Leslie Knope,"Supernauseated for a few days, a lot of barfing."
Leslie Knope,It's a total disaster.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I have a ton of work to do, so I need the good stuff."
Leslie Knope,The Mariah needs to sing tonight stuff.
Extra,"You don't look flushed, no signs of fever."
Extra,That just doesn't seem like the flu.
Leslie Knope,It's the flu.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't think it could be anythingâ¦"
Andy Dwyer,This counts as one.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so mad at my parents.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, they both wanted the house for Columbus Day weekend, and they fought so much, they decided to just sell it to spite each other."
Ron Swanson,"More wine, less talking."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, you are a wonderful guy, and I admire many things about you."
Ben Wyatt,But you're a terrible person to discuss personal problems with.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, friend."
Ron Swanson,That really means a lot to me.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Pumpkin, undertones of lavender."
Craig Middlebrooks,Medium plus body.
Craig Middlebrooks,It's mostly pumpkin.
Craig Middlebrooks,"There's so much pumpkin, it's like a Charlie Brown Halloween special."
April Ludgate,"I'm getting notes of dried robin's blood, old, dirty cashews and just a hint of a robot's bathwater."
Xander,An old world wine.
Xander,Italian.
Xander,Ah.
Xander,"It's a Verdicchio Doc Classico, 2010."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's new world.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Northern California, Napa Valley."
Craig Middlebrooks,Some place beautiful and warm and amazing where everyone is in great shape and the night sky is full of stars!
April Ludgate,This comes from your mother's butt.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you were in the bathroom forever."
Andy Dwyer,The receptionist said that Chipp will be out in just a second.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I just need a minute."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to call Ben about nothing.
Ben Wyatt,My parents make me so mad sometimes.
Ben Wyatt,"Just like the time they couldn't decide who gets the dog, so they just dropped it off at the local synagogue."
Ben Wyatt,"I was, like, ""Say what?"""
Ben Wyatt,"Hold on, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Hold that thought.
Ben Wyatt,Just for a sec.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, honey."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's your me.
Leslie Knope,It's wife.
Ben Wyatt,It's Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Knope.
Leslie Knope,I have very big news for you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, my teeth are blue."
Ben Wyatt,Blueberries
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you having a stroke?
Ben Wyatt,I was just saying to Ron that my dog's Jewish.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Phone water.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,It's dead.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Leslie sounded weird."
Ben Wyatt,I don't want to wait for Tom.
Ben Wyatt,I want to walk home.
Ron Swanson,I'll join you.
Ron Swanson,I'm always game for a brisk walk.
Ron Swanson,"Also, if I leave you alone, I'm pretty sure you'll die."
Ben Wyatt,Home is that way.
Ben Wyatt,Watch out for that fence.
Xander,"Ah, Mister Haverford."
Xander,Allow me to introduce Terrence Montreaux.
Xander,He is a restaurateur like yourself.
Tom Haverford,"You own a restaurant, too?"
Terrence Montreaux,"No, monsieur."
Terrence Montreaux,I own 12.
Terrence Montreaux,"I am here to find the best sommeliers as soon as they are, how you say, certified."
Tom Haverford,That was my idea.
Terrence Montreaux,That is everyone's idea.
Terrence Montreaux,"That is why we have this, how do you say, thing."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, don't act like you don't know the word ""thing."""
Craig Middlebrooks,"With a filet mignon, I'd recommend a red."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Something bold and dry, like David Sedaris."
Extra,Perhaps you could recommend a Riesling instead.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Not if you're eating steak, you loon."
April Ludgate,"You know in the movies, when the cops show up and they find lipstick on a wine glass next to a dead body?"
April Ludgate,This is that wine.
Chipp McCapp,I'll bring the girls You bring the beer And the troops will bring the freedom
Leslie Knope,"We're sorry to interrupt, Chipp."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,We just wanted to say we are such big fans.
Leslie Knope,It's an honor to meet you.
Chipp McCapp,Yeah.
Chipp McCapp,"Well, I'm very blessed."
Chipp McCapp,And it's always nice to meet my amazing fans who keep me going.
Chipp McCapp,You're the real superstars.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chipp McCapp,Can somebody give me one of those LunchStacks?
Chipp McCapp,And stack them for me this time.
Chipp McCapp,"Cheese on top, or no one gets paid."
Extra,"You got it, Chipp."
Chipp McCapp,That's my dad.
Chipp McCapp,Guy's such an idiot.
Andy Dwyer,We wanted to talk to you about the Unity Concert in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Can you do it?
Chipp McCapp,Yeah.
Chipp McCapp,"Uh, no."
Chipp McCapp,"I'm sorry, I got a previous engagement."
Chipp McCapp,It's a bummer.
Chipp McCapp,Oh.
Extra,"Here you go, Chipp."
Chipp McCapp,Look at that.
Chipp McCapp,The cheese is on top.
Chipp McCapp,Of turkey.
Chipp McCapp,You dick.
Chipp McCapp,I want ham.
Extra,"Sorry, son."
Extra,They were out of ham.
Chipp McCapp,"All right, well, maybe I should just let Mom be manager, then?"
Chipp McCapp,"Pick them up, Skipp."
Andy Dwyer,Ew!
Andy Dwyer,This guy's the worst.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, it sucks that they didn't have ham."
Andy Dwyer,But you can't treat your dad like that.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,He's a monster.
Leslie Knope,But we need him.
Chipp McCapp,"Your job's not that hard, okay?"
Chipp McCapp,Just anticipate my needs.
Extra,"Anticipating, Chipp."
Extra,"Of the 25 entrants today, only one has deemed himself worthy of a sommelier certificate."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,No way.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Thank you so much, everyone."
April Ludgate,I think we can agree that all wine tastes the same.
April Ludgate,"And if you spend more than $5 on wine, you are very stupid."
Extra,Security.
April Ludgate,I just want to thank all the people that got me here.
April Ludgate,"Norbit, uh, Pluto Nash, all the Klumps."
Extra,"Congratulations to the next Indiana Master Sommelier, Xander Truffant."
Tom Haverford,I've got to go talk to Xander before Terrence gets to him.
Tom Haverford,Cover me.
Donna Meagle,Got you.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my goodness."
Terrence Montreaux,Mon dieu!
Terrence Montreaux,Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, je suis desole, monsieur."
Donna Meagle,"Allons-y, allons-y."
Tom Haverford,Xander.
Xander,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro is going to be the dopest, quite possibly trillest restaurant in the area."
Tom Haverford,What do you say?
Tom Haverford,You want to work with me?
Xander,"Thank you, but I've already accepted an offer from Monsieur Montreaux."
Tom Haverford,I'll double whatever he's paying you.
Xander,"You'll pay me $500,000 a year?"
Tom Haverford,I will pay you one-tenth of whatever he's paying you.
Xander,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man, this wine bottle is all out of the wine."
Ron Dunn,"Well, hello, gentlemen."
Ron Dunn,What brings you out on this fine evening?
Ron Swanson,Mother [bleep].
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Where'd you come from?
Ron Dunn,"Uh, that's a complicated question."
Ron Dunn,All depends on whether your conception of time is linear or circular.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ron Dunn,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ben Wyatt,You know this hobo?
Ron Swanson,He was my counterpart from the Eagleton Parks Department.
Ben Wyatt,Dude.
Ben Wyatt,Are you a ghost?
Ron Dunn,Am I?
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,We know that you have that important other engagement--
Chipp McCapp,"Yo, I gots to get that haircut."
Chipp McCapp,Snip!
Leslie Knope,It's not just Pawnee that needs you.
Leslie Knope,It's the entire region.
Extra,"Permission to speak, son?"
Extra,Pawnee is kind of the gateway to that whole region.
Extra,They do buy a lot of albums.
Chipp McCapp,They sure ain't buying toothpaste.
Chipp McCapp,Bunch of dirty hicks.
Chipp McCapp,"What if we fly me in and out same day, so I wouldn't have to spend a night in your crap town?"
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is a good town.
Leslie Knope,With good people from all walks of life.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family."
Chipp McCapp,You think I care about that?
Chipp McCapp,Look.
Chipp McCapp,I can do whatever I want.
Chipp McCapp,All right?
Chipp McCapp,"If I want to shoot a paintball gun at my dad, I'm going to do it."
Extra,"Good shot, son."
Extra,I'm proud of you.
Leslie Knope,You're crazy.
Leslie Knope,This is over.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee does not need you.
Leslie Knope,"And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier, there was pee on my palms."
Leslie Knope,That makes us sound like hicks.
Leslie Knope,We're not.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Stupid.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You were great.
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to punch that kid's lights out.
Leslie Knope,It was not awesome.
Leslie Knope,"I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up, and Ben has not called me back yet."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.
Leslie Knope,There's just a lot of things going on right now.
Leslie Knope,Personal things that I can't talk to you about.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, Leslie, sometimes life throws us crazy curves."
Andy Dwyer,"And yes, this moment may be the biggest curve you've ever had to deal with."
Andy Dwyer,But just because your family is getting bigger does not mean that you can't handle it.
Andy Dwyer,You and Ben can handle anything.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, thank you."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does."
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap!
Andy Dwyer,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What did you think?
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were getting a dog.
Leslie Knope,Why did you go like this?
Andy Dwyer,That's a sign for petting a dog that's sitting on your lap.
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner."
Leslie Knope,We are out of options.
Leslie Knope,It's time for a Hail Mary.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?
Andy Dwyer,Same way I got a perfect score on the SATs.
Andy Dwyer,Broken Scantron machine.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,And you stand by.
Andy Dwyer,Stand by.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
Scott Tanner,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,It's Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, hi."
Andy Dwyer,My name's Andy.
Andy Dwyer,And this barfing lady over here is Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,We just need 10 minutes of your time.
Scott Tanner,To do what?
Andy Dwyer,To convince you to reunite Land Ho.
Scott Tanner,"Listen, it means a lot to me that you guys loved the band."
Scott Tanner,And I'm going to tell you the exact same thing I've told everyone who has ever asked us to reunite.
Scott Tanner,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I know that you and the band aren't on the best of terms right now."
Andy Dwyer,But bringing people together is exactly what we want to talk to you about.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that down at the bottom.
Ben Wyatt,Mr. Ron Dunn.
Ben Wyatt,I have something I'm very angry about.
Ben Wyatt,"But other Ron, he's not helping me with it."
Ben Wyatt,Can you help?
Ron Dunn,I can tell by the indigo on your Chiclet that you've been drinking blueberry wine.
Ron Dunn,That's a good start.
Ron Dunn,"The Wamapoke called it ""mattapiqua."""
Ron Dunn,They believed it had mystical powers.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it also tastes like jelly."
Ron Dunn,"So, what's got your goat there, friend?"
Ben Wyatt,"My parents, they had this lake house and they sold it without telling me."
Ben Wyatt,"And so, I was like, ""Why?"
Ben Wyatt,"""You know?"""
Ben Wyatt,"I was like, ""God!"""
Ben Wyatt,You guys!
Ron Dunn,Oh.
Ron Dunn,"You're hanging onto that anger for dear life, compadre."
Ron Dunn,Let's role play.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, goodnight, everyone."
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm going to go home and feel totally fine.
Craig Middlebrooks,Who am I kidding?
Craig Middlebrooks,"I'm going to go home, put on a Macy Gray album, and cry in the mirror!"
Donna Meagle,Why are you bummed?
Craig Middlebrooks,Are you all blind?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want that job at Tom's Bistro.
Craig Middlebrooks,I've been trying to show you for the last five hours.
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, you know your stuff, but you're like a crazy volcano."
Tom Haverford,You'd have to show me you can bring it down a notch.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I'll bring it down 1,000 notches if I have to!"
Scott Tanner,This looks like it's going to be a great concert.
Scott Tanner,The band just does not play anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I understand."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Um, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,My stomach is trying to murder me.
Scott Tanner,You still drunk from last night?
Scott Tanner,I've been there.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, this town still loves you."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm in a band myself, actually."
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,And we cover about five of your songs and they just go nuts.
Scott Tanner,Really? Which ones?
Andy Dwyer,"Catapult me into the Sun, and I'll burn, baby, burn."
Scott Tanner,"Oh, yeah."
Extra,Johnny Karate.
Scott Tanner,I thought you said your name was Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it is."
Andy Dwyer,I'm also a children's performer.
Extra,He played at Joey's birthday and he's awesome.
Extra,Sing Karate Chop Master.
Andy Dwyer,I'll do it as long as your dad sings along.
Scott Tanner,Let's do it.
Andy Dwyer,It's easy.
Andy Dwyer,You'll pick it up.
Andy Dwyer,"Karate chop master I'm a karate chop master And I will karate chop you Chop, chop, chop, chop Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop"
Andy Dwyer,"Scott, you sing."
Scott Tanner,"Chop, chop, kick, kick Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Just listen to me.
Andy Dwyer,Chop and a chop and a kick-kick-kick-kick chop And tighten the throat And chop-a-kick chop
Andy Dwyer,"Now, your turn."
Scott Tanner,"Chop, chop, kick, kick, chop"
Andy Dwyer,"Harmony! Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,"Chop, chop, kick Chop, kick-kick-kick And a chop and a kick and a kick and a No."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,It's not-- You didn't-- I mean-- Just listen.
Craig Middlebrooks,Good evening.
Craig Middlebrooks,May I assist you with a wine tonight?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I'm having fish, so maybe a full-bodied red?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"You know, sir, you might want to consider something white to go with your fish."
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,Red.
Donna Meagle,And bring some ice cubes.
Donna Meagle,I like ice cubes in my red wine.
April Ludgate,"I'll have a glass of your most expensive red wine mixed with a glass of your cheapest white wine, served in a dog bowl."
April Ludgate,"And silly straws all around, please."
Craig Middlebrooks,I'll be right back with my recommendations.
Tom Haverford,He seems to be keeping it together.
Craig Middlebrooks,"What kind of monster orders red with fish? I know they're messing with me and it's just a test, but have some decency!"
Craig Middlebrooks,"For you, sir, a light, crisp Pinot with just a hint of lemon to bring out the flavors in your fish."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I brought you a bold Cabernet, which should still taste okay when watered down."
Craig Middlebrooks,"And for you, madam, would you consider this rose?"
Craig Middlebrooks,It's halfway between red and white.
Tom Haverford,Thanks very much.
Craig Middlebrooks,Enjoy.
Tom Haverford,I think I may have found my new sommelier.
Craig Middlebrooks,That was so embarrassing!
Tom Haverford,We'll have to make sure the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro is soundproof.
Ron Dunn,That was beautiful.
Ron Dunn,You're surrendering to the Earth Mother.
Ron Dunn,"Now, stare into the fire and picture your spirit animal."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what my spirit animal is.
Ron Swanson,Because it doesn't exist because that's nonsense because you're an adult.
Ron Dunn,Baby snow owl.
Ben Wyatt,He's right.
Ron Dunn,Our spirit animals connect us to the natural world.
Ron Dunn,You need to remain open to their message.
Ron Dunn,Watch.
Ron Dunn,"Welcome back, old friend."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ron Dunn,"If you really want to cleanse yourself of that anger, take that check and send it into the flames."
Ron Dunn,And up into the air with your screams.
Ron Swanson,Do not burn that check.
Ron Swanson,It is money.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron is right, Ron."
Ron Dunn,"There, there, baby snow owl."
Ron Dunn,You're safe now.
Ron Swanson,This is him right here.
Ron Swanson,I'll also get out here and walk home.
Ron Dunn,You sure? This thing runs on vegetable oil and bat guano.
Ron Dunn,Actually cleans the air as it drives.
Ron Swanson,Quite sure.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for helping me with my anger.
Ron Dunn,You've already emerged from your cocoon.
Ron Dunn,"Now the question is, will you fly?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't feel any better."
Ben Wyatt,I'm still angry.
Ben Wyatt,Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know why this lake house thing is driving me so crazy.
Ron Swanson,Sorry we couldn't help you work through your problems.
Ron Swanson,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lady, two little girls, and an infant waiting for me."
Ron Swanson,It's always nice to see the kids at the end of a long day.
Ron Swanson,Really puts things in perspective.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I have so much to tell you."
Leslie Knope,We got Land Ho to play the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, what happened to you?"
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't matter.
Ben Wyatt,I thought I was upset because my parents are insane.
Ben Wyatt,But Ron kind of just showed me the real reason.
Ben Wyatt,"I have so many childhood memories at that lake house that, in the back of my mind, I always pictured taking my kids-- or taking our kids there."
Ben Wyatt,I want to start our family.
