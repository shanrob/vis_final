Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Tom Haverford,Swiss Family Ronbinson!
Tom Haverford,That hat is dope.
Ron Swanson,"Thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford,You mind if I rock that bad Larry on my dome?
Tom Haverford,Wear it on my head?
Tom Haverford,Try it on the ladies?
Ron Swanson,Be my guest.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Tom."
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon on my head.
Tom Haverford,Excuse me?
Tom Haverford,My friend over here was digging through your trash and I think we may have a lot in common.
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Tom Haverford,Would you like to see a movie sometime?
Tom Haverford,Are you a raccoon?
Tom Haverford,Because you've been running around my hat all day-- Head all day.
Tom Haverford,"Girl, you're more precious than Precious."
Donna Meagle,Uh-uh.
Tom Haverford,"""Nice hat. Wanna bone?"""
Tom Haverford,"That's you, talking to me."
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,"How about, ""Yes, I am a hunter, and it's you season."""
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, that's great."
Tom Haverford,I gotta get back out there.
Tom Haverford,"You know what they say, animal on the head, manimal in the bed."
Tom Haverford,"Damn, girl!"
Tom Haverford,Your hotness killed my raccoon!
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon hat.
Tom Haverford,I'm an interesting person.
Tom Haverford,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Any luck?
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Didn't work out as well as I thought it would.
Ron Swanson,"Well, better luck next time."
Tom Haverford,I tried.
Tom Haverford,It just didn't seem like--
Extra,Wow.
Extra,I love that hat.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise for you.
Leslie Knope,Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,It's a surprise!
Leslie Knope,What's the surprise?
Leslie Knope,"If I told you, it would ruin the surprise."
Ron Swanson,What's the surprise it would ruin?
Leslie Knope,I cannot tell you that.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, my first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me a surprise birthday party."
Ron Swanson,"When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home."
Ron Swanson,I'm not big on surprises.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're gonna like this one."
Ron Swanson,What is it?
Leslie Knope,I'm not telling you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna tell anybody!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you.
Leslie Knope,We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.
Leslie Knope,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter."""
Leslie Knope,It's the biggest catalog of the year.
Leslie Knope,Think of the September issue of Vogue.
Leslie Knope,But it's more important to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold."
Tom Haverford,"Centerfold, always the best part."
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,"Damn, they broke up six weeks ago."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures."
Jerry Gergich,"Here you go, Chief."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, good job."
Leslie Knope,Nice work.
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,Isn't that that creepy guy?
April Ludgate,Morgan?
April Ludgate,The pedophile?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it is."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Jerry Gergich,I didn't know that!
Jerry Gergich,He seemed okay.
Jerry Gergich,We had dinner together.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I will Photoshop his face."
April Ludgate,"Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, April."
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,Cover photo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're up."
Tom Haverford,"This catalog is basically, like, an ad for the Parks Department, and I love ads."
Tom Haverford,"I love magazine ads for flavored vodkas, billboards for designer jeans."
Tom Haverford,I TiVo through shows to get to the ads.
Tom Haverford,I love ads.
Tom Haverford,What are we trying to do with this catalog?
Tom Haverford,We're trying to sell Pawnee on our summer classes.
Tom Haverford,How do we do that?
Tom Haverford,"With one perfect, captivating image."
Tom Haverford,April?
Tom Haverford,Modern life.
Tom Haverford,Where are we running?
Tom Haverford,"Sometimes, what we want is not always where we are."
Tom Haverford,Next slide.
Tom Haverford,Are we alone?
Tom Haverford,Is the real winter inside our hearts?
Tom Haverford,We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons."
Leslie Knope,"One, this is a summer catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Two, that was complete gibberish."
Leslie Knope,"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned."
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, boo."
Tom Haverford,Next slide.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,How did that... That's a personal photo.
Tom Haverford,"That's... Shouldn't be.. This must've... You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo."
Tom Haverford,"I'm cool with it, if you guys are."
Tom Haverford,It's a high-res photo.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Tom Haverford,A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,Get me that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I gotta go.
Tom Haverford,What is he thinking?
April Ludgate,"""Why is my cup so tiny?"""
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy six month anniversary.
Mark Brendanawicz,I got you a gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a chicken salad sandwich.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And I don't want you to feel bad about not getting me anything, because I would never expect--"
Ann Perkins,"Swiss Army Watch, mofo."
Mark Brendanawicz,Well done.
Mark Brendanawicz,Perkins.
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you so much.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's so nice.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you allowed to kiss me in a hospital room?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Ann Perkins,He's dead.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I'm just kidding, he's sleeping."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, our relationship is going well."
Mark Brendanawicz,Really well.
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy really seemed dead.
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
April Ludgate,"Here, catch this."
Andy Dwyer,You got me in the face!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,That one hurt.
Andy Dwyer,You've a good arm.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I used to play softball in high school.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,I played baseball in high school.
April Ludgate,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, don't play with the food, okay?"
Leslie Knope,We need this for the picnic.
Leslie Knope,Do we have everything?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,"Three picnic baskets, assorted cheeses, grapes, wine."
Leslie Knope,Smoked salmon?
Andy Dwyer,April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.
Ann Perkins,And why did I believe that?
Tom Haverford,"Maybe in your heart you knew it was from me, but you came anyway."
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?"
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Tom Haverford,Look at you two.
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,"""Anndanawicz."""
Tom Haverford,"Or ""Merkins."""
Tom Haverford,"No, ""Anndanawicz."""
Tom Haverford,You two should be models.
Tom Haverford,Maybe on the cover of the Parks Department Summer Catalog?
Ann Perkins,"That's not the reason you called me in here, right?"
Ann Perkins,Cause I just finished a 12 hour shift.
Ann Perkins,If that's the reason--
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann."
Tom Haverford,It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.
Tom Haverford,You know how important this is to her.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I am in."
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am.
Mark Brendanawicz,We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you have."
Ann Perkins,And thank God an opportunity presented itself.
Mark Brendanawicz,See?
Mark Brendanawicz,Win win.
Tom Haverford,"Now, Ann, you're gonna change, right?"
Ann Perkins,I guess.
Tom Haverford,Would it kill you to maybe put on some lipstick?
Tom Haverford,Do you even own lipstick?
Leslie Knope,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,It kind of makes you-- What is this?
Andy Dwyer,Sweater swap!
Andy Dwyer,She noticed!
Andy Dwyer,You were right.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Somebody's here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, just act normal."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Just be like normal people.
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,David Moser!
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,It is such an honor to meet you.
David Moser,Right.
David Moser,How long is this gonna take?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, not very long."
Leslie Knope,"I realize, of course, you're a very busy man."
Leslie Knope,I love parks.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.
Leslie Knope,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors-- Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?"
Leslie Knope,"Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park."
Leslie Knope,I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
David Moser,"I thought you were dead, Clarence."
Clarence Carrington,No.
Clarence Carrington,"I'm gonna outlive you, then I'm gonna nail your wife."
David Moser,"Screw you, you old coot."
Michael Tansley,Classic David.
Michael Tansley,You're worse than Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Shut your damn mouth, Tansley."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!"""
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Andy Dwyer,Apartment!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.
Leslie Knope,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Where are they going with the food?
Ron Swanson,I'm starving.
Ron Swanson,I only had one breakfast.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Look, what was going on back there?"
Leslie Knope,Why all the sniping?
Ron Swanson,Not exactly sure.
Ron Swanson,"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm hungry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby."
Leslie Knope,I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
Ron Swanson,I ate it already.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.
Ron Swanson,And now it's gone.
Ron Swanson,And I hate everything.
Tom Haverford,"Good, good, good."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I think we got the boring cliche shot that Leslie wanted.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it?
Mark Brendanawicz,We're done?
Tom Haverford,Not even close.
Tom Haverford,Now the real art begins.
Tom Haverford,"Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image."
Tom Haverford,"Step two, book some outside gigs."
Tom Haverford,"Step three, have sex with a model."
Tom Haverford,"Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model."
Tom Haverford,"Go, yes!"
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,"Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?"
Ann Perkins,What do you want me to do?
Tom Haverford,Do what Mark's doing.
Tom Haverford,He's doing great!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm not doing anything, soâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog."
Clarence Carrington,I remember.
Clarence Carrington,That first year we offered four classes.
Clarence Carrington,I actually taught Homemaking.
Clarence Carrington,Women were not allowed to teach back then.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I thought there were female teachers way before then.
Clarence Carrington,Not in my department.
Leslie Knope,"Well, times have changed."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department."
Clarence Carrington,"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea."
Clarence Carrington,"Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Clarence Carrington,"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety."
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,No!
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?"
Andy Dwyer,The picnic we're having.
Andy Dwyer,"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic."
April Ludgate,That's good.
April Ludgate,How about Life is a Picnic with You?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Then it could be about a girl.
Andy Dwyer,Or Peyton Manning!
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
Andy Dwyer,You wanna help me write the lyrics?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
Andy Dwyer,We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I would do that."
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,I just have to get my stuff from the office.
April Ludgate,But that's-- That'd be cool.
Leslie Knope,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?"
David Moser,"Well, I was in Public Works for eight years."
David Moser,But the director was pretty young.
David Moser,Clarence was old and weak.
David Moser,"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out."
Leslie Knope,There was no other reason you wanted the job?
David Moser,No.
David Moser,Just the money and the pension.
David Moser,The actual job's a nightmare.
David Moser,"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap."
Leslie Knope,"Well, David, I think we've talked enough."
Tom Haverford,"Mark, that's great."
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, great."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, you look miserable!"
Tom Haverford,Terrible.
Tom Haverford,Terrible!
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann."
Tom Haverford,What are we doing?
Tom Haverford,Maxim or Good Housekeeping?
Ann Perkins,I'm not sure which one is the insult.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's stop for a second."
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, I love how you work."
Bobby,Yay!
Tom Haverford,You can have as many juice boxes as you want.
Tom Haverford,"In fact, grab me one, too."
Tom Haverford,Make it an apple.
Tom Haverford,"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, take a walk with me."
Tom Haverford,"In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot."
Ann Perkins,"Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?"
Tom Haverford,I just don't get it.
Tom Haverford,How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.
Ann Perkins,"And screaming, ""Make your face better!"" doesn't help."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working."
Tom Haverford,And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.
Tom Haverford,"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude."
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.
Tom Haverford,I totally understand.
Tom Haverford,But we should get one for safety.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,We're almost there.
Leslie Knope,It's right up here.
Clarence Carrington,You really shouldn't be leading us.
Clarence Carrington,"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears."
Leslie Knope,Holy God.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Ron Swanson,Eat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped."
Leslie Knope,But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.
David Moser,Hey.
David Moser,I just whizzed on a butterfly!
Leslie Knope,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog."
David Moser,You should just copy the Eagleton one.
David Moser,I used to just copy the Eagleton one.
Leslie Knope,Did you?
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.
Michael Tansley,"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Michael."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?
Michael Tansley,"Oh, in a way."
Michael Tansley,"Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves."
Michael Tansley,That was the best part of the job.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,I totally agree.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank goodness for you."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, thank goodness for Michael."
Ron Swanson,"Are you still on parole, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ha, ha."
Leslie Knope,"Very funny, Ron."
Michael Tansley,Yes.
Michael Tansley,"Yes, Ron, I am."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,He smoked pot.
Ron Swanson,In the office.
Ron Swanson,And in all the parks.
Ron Swanson,Constantly.
Michael Tansley,"In fairness to me, it was a different time."
Michael Tansley,It was the early '90s.
Michael Tansley,"But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal."
Michael Tansley,Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.
Michael Tansley,"Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?"
Michael Tansley,"That makes sense to you, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?"
April Ludgate,The super old one.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Mmmhmm.
April Ludgate,I'm an eyebrow girl.
April Ludgate,I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.
Andy Dwyer,That is really gross.
Clarence Carrington,Anybody got any water?
David Moser,I want water.
David Moser,"I'm so old, I need to drink water."
Michael Tansley,"Oh, stop it, stop taunting him."
Clarence Carrington,"I don't need your help, jailbird."
Ron Swanson,"If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it."
Michael Tansley,Yeah.
Michael Tansley,Like you claimed my job?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you know what I would love?"
Leslie Knope,"I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything."
Michael Tansley,I agree.
Michael Tansley,"Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down."
Leslie Knope,Another?
Michael Tansley,"By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal."
Michael Tansley,It grows in the ground!
Michael Tansley,"I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!"
Leslie Knope,What?
David Moser,"You know, Michael?"
David Moser,You are one pot loving mother [bleep] pain in the rectum.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"You're all being awful, horrible men!"
Clarence Carrington,Uh-oh.
Clarence Carrington,Your little friend come to visit?
Leslie Knope,"Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles."
David Moser,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"No! You're next, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Andy! Let's take this picture.
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Get out of your seats, turds."
David Moser,What?
Leslie Knope,Line up over there.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Just please try to look human.
Leslie Knope,"All right, and not so evil."
Leslie Knope,Everybody looking here.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.
Leslie Knope,Everybody take their stuff and go.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, ooh, ooh."
Andy Dwyer,Can we do one funny face one?
Leslie Knope,Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.
April Ludgate,It was really hard.
April Ludgate,Their mouths are so old.
Leslie Knope,God! Look at these horrible men.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog."
April Ludgate,Would you like these men in your catalog?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, April."
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
April Ludgate,What? Look how generous they're being with each other.
Tom Haverford,"And here's the ""Obstruction"" series."
Tom Haverford,"What do you think? Amazing, right? I call this one ""The Future."""
Ann Perkins,It's completely blurry.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What about the ones we took on the swing? The normal ones?
Tom Haverford,"You mean the ""Unhappy Wife"" photos?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"These are even worse, somehow."
Ann Perkins,I look miserable.
Mark Brendanawicz,You do look kind of miserable.
Tom Haverford,"Now you know what I meant by, ""Make your face better."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was there something wrong, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, I had just gotten off a long shift."
Ann Perkins,He was being really annoying.
Tom Haverford,Mark looks happy.
Ann Perkins,"Just please don't use these, okay? Let's grab some dinner."
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.
Ron Swanson,Did you print this out? I heard the printer going.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper.
Leslie Knope,Oh! Wisdom! Finally.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,You can also keep the photo.
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the memories.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,I don't remember this.
Leslie Knope,That-- That's the wrong one.
Leslie Knope,But the real one's very bad as well.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope,"So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, disgusting fragrance flap."
Ron Swanson,Let me buy you dinner.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I insist you buy me dinner.
April Ludgate,Get a drink.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,It's cool.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Bouncer,ID.
April Ludgate,I'm 24.
Bouncer,"No, you're not."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm 25."
April Ludgate,"No old jokes, please."
Bouncer,ID.
Bouncer,It says right here you're 20.
Bouncer,You're not even gonna show me a fake?
April Ludgate,Sometimes the confidence confuses people.
Bouncer,"You're good, bro."
Andy Dwyer,You know what? I think I'll just... I'm gonna--
April Ludgate,"Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh... Yeah, actually, I should get going home."
Andy Dwyer,I have a lot of stuff to do.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I should go home."
Andy Dwyer,Clean and stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Butâ¦
April Ludgate,"Yeah, okay, cool."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I gotta go home, too."
April Ludgate,Soâ¦
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,See you!
April Ludgate,Later.
Ron Swanson,"The usual, Marta."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too, Marta."
Marta,You got it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one."
Ron Swanson,Screwed the pooch?
Leslie Knope,I don't like that term.
Leslie Knope,It's so vulgar.
Leslie Knope,"Ron! That sucked, today."
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry.
Ron Swanson,There's no other way to say it.
Ron Swanson,They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.
Ron Swanson,What did you think they were gonna say to you?
Leslie Knope,"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career."
Leslie Knope,"""You are the chosen one."""
Leslie Knope,Or something.
Ron Swanson,"Well, okay, so, that was the problem."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.
Leslie Knope,But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.
Leslie Knope,Are we gonna hate each other someday?
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Ron Swanson,I think we're gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, soâ¦ Maybe I should go somewhere."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I should move, to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, the thought of that."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton."
Ron Swanson,"When I become City Manager, my job is yours."
Ron Swanson,"Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department."
Ron Swanson,Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Who knows what the future holds for me?
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.
Leslie Knope,"Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Although, I do expect a fight from Ron."
Leslie Knope,But I'll win.
Ron Swanson,Mmm!
