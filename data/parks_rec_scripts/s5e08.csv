Extra,"Support for Pawnee Community Radio comes from listeners like you and from the new film The Shadows of Seven Heads, the dramic tale of an Israeli soldier who falls in love with conjoined Palestinian sextuplets."
Extra,Out soon from Focus Features.
Derry Murbles,"Welcome to ""Thought For Your Thoughts."""
Derry Murbles,"I'm your host Derry Murbles, sitting in for Nina Joplin, who is touring the country performing a spokenword opera about pearshaped women."
Derry Murbles,My guest today is City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"It is a pleasure to be back, Derry."
Leslie Knope,Your show last week on dolphin lactation was just riveting radio.
Leslie Knope,"Derry, my team and I are trying to build a park, and we need input on the design from you, the citizens of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,So I guess I'm here to send out the Bat Signal.
Derry Murbles,"A Bat Signal, for listeners who might not know, refers to the children's character ""the Bat Man"" a strong gentleman who fights crime nocturnally."
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,Well put.
Leslie Knope,This park is going to be a celebration of Pawnee by Pawnee and for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, send in your plan or your resume And quick."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,This is all gonna fall apart if you don't hurry.
Derry Murbles,"Coming up after the break, movie reviews with Ken Tucker who is filling in for David Bianculli who's in New York filling in for Ken Tucker."
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, would you like to introduce the next segment?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"""Now it's time for 'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, ' ""today we have a recording of Benny Goodman played over a separate recording of Miles Davis."""
Derry Murbles,Research shows that our listeners love jazz.
Leslie Knope,"All right, so this is a letter from what looks like a federal penitentiary."
Leslie Knope,"""Here's a model of what I thought the park could look like."
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm innocent."
Leslie Knope,"Please find me a lawyer."""
Leslie Knope,I'm getting kind of worried.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we have not received one usable idea so far."
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Look at this guy.
Ben Wyatt,"""30 years of experience ""with a degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen."""
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Beautiful fountain.
Leslie Knope,Perfectly manicured shrubbery.
Leslie Knope,This is like Parks Department porn.
Leslie Knope,This guy is great.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if he's some junkie war criminal pimp.
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna change my mind.
Ben Wyatt,His name's Wreston St. James.
Ben Wyatt,He's from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I've changed my mind."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves."
Leslie Knope,"God, that was close."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we don't have a lot of time, and he is the first decent candidate."
Ben Wyatt,So let's at least go meet the guy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,Then we can reject him face to face.
Leslie Knope,I like your plan.
Tom Haverford,"Friends, former lovers, acquaintances, Jerry, I introduce you to the future home of RentASwag!"
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Tom Haverford,"Much like women in '90s standup comedy routines, Tommy be shopping."
Tom Haverford,I started a business where I rent my fancy clothes to teens so their parents don't have to buy them nice things they'll just grow out of.
Tom Haverford,"So if you see a 14 year old kid wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat, you know who to thank."
Tom Haverford,Me.
Tom Haverford,And Louis Vuitton for making some dopeass cravats.
Ron Swanson,"Son, I love wildlife, but is a store the best place for it?"
Jerry Gergich,Help.
Tom Haverford,"The place needs some work, but this is a great location."
Tom Haverford,"Lots of foot traffic, no metered parking."
Tom Haverford,And it's well within my fiscal range.
Donna Meagle,"Good use of the word fiscal, Tommy very upscale."
Chris Traeger,Very impressive.
Chris Traeger,Watching you gives me faith that anyone can reinvent themselves.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake is dead.
Tom Haverford,Long live Thomas M.
Tom Haverford,"Haverford, responsible tycoon."
Jerry Gergich,Help.
Jerry Gergich,I can't move.
Leslie Knope,He designed this place?
Leslie Knope,What a dump.
Wreston St. James,Ben!
Wreston St. James,Leslie.
Wreston St. James,Hi!
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Wreston St. James,Wreston St. James.
Wreston St. James,Thank you so much for coming.
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
Wreston St. James,"Well, what do you think of our newest park?"
Leslie Knope,Eh.
Leslie Knope,"In a word, underwhelming."
Leslie Knope,And a little inconvenient.
Leslie Knope,There's no trash cans anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"What am I supposed to do with my garbage, just throw it on the ground?"
Extra,"Oh, hey."
Extra,Thank you for the trash!
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, I have to say, this park is incredible."
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Wreston St. James,"Its official name is ""Five Mile Grounds"", but we like to call it ""Wide smiles abound."""
Ben Wyatt,Because of all the smiles that occur?
Leslie Knope,It's so boring.
Wreston St. James,"Come on, I'll take you guys on a little tour."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,He seems super cool.
Leslie Knope,He seems cool.
Leslie Knope,Just you wait.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.
Andy Dwyer,Ah.
Andy Dwyer,Uhh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe, it's me."
Andy Dwyer,"Will you come down here, please, and keep me company?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm so bored.
Andy Dwyer,I need you.
April Ludgate,"If I come down there, can I at least break something?"
Andy Dwyer,"Of course, baby."
Andy Dwyer,Anything.
Andy Dwyer,You know that.
Andy Dwyer,Chris gave me this great job as a weekend security guard at City Hall.
Andy Dwyer,Only one problem it's a terrible job.
Andy Dwyer,"I did everything I was supposed to do, and I walked around the building four times."
Andy Dwyer,Only 20 minutes has gone by.
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,Thought maybe ten minutes had gone by since I started talking.
Andy Dwyer,It's only been 15 seconds.
Andy Dwyer,"Ohh Oh, babe, thank God you're here."
Andy Dwyer,"I got so bored, I started thinking about existence ""Do I matter?"""
Andy Dwyer,Do any of us?
Andy Dwyer,"Is there a master plan in the works, a grand design?"
Andy Dwyer,Just dumb stuff like that.
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,Who cares?
Andy Dwyer,I thought being a security guard would be exciting.
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,Isn't this how all great Bert Macklin cases start?
April Ludgate,It's quiet.
April Ludgate,A little too quiet.
Wreston St. James,"As you can see, we like to keep things quite immaculate."
Wreston St. James,I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park whatever happened with that?
Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, except for the smell."
Ben Wyatt,The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.
Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?
Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?
Wreston St. James,"Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project."
Wreston St. James,It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.
Wreston St. James,It's about the people.
Wreston St. James,We're here to serve them.
Extra,"Hey, Mr. St. James!"
Wreston St. James,"Oh, our balloon artisan is out of balloons."
Wreston St. James,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,I have chills.
Ben Wyatt,Look at my arm.
Leslie Knope,Why are you so charmed by him?
Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Rhett Butler.
Ben Wyatt,That's who he reminds me of.
Ben Wyatt,Or Bono!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.
Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado."
Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home."
Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.
Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan."
Ben Wyatt,It's us.
Tom Haverford,"Great work, team."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and your work are ravishing, as usual."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, great organizational skills."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Genuine praise.
Tom Haverford,It's a tip I picked up from Lee Iacocca's autobiography.
Tom Haverford,A small connection between you and your workers helps build loyalty.
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,How's the old ticker?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, uh, the rehab is grueling"
Tom Haverford,Great!
Tom Haverford,Glad to hear it.
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Roomba, drop a beat!"
Tom Haverford,RentASwag is gonna be the opposite of Entertainment720.
Tom Haverford,This is my last chance.
Tom Haverford,"If this goes down in flames, I will have nothing except my looks."
Tom Haverford,I could always pimp myself out to hot older ladies.
Tom Haverford,I need to remember that.
Leslie Knope,"May, 1817."
Leslie Knope,"A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana."
Wreston St. James,We owe them a debt of gratitude.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?
Wreston St. James,"Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides."
Wreston St. James,That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly and selfdefeating.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.
Wreston St. James,"Look Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea."
Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.
Leslie Knope,Typical.
Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up."
Ben Wyatt,"We have a mural called ""The Many Surrenders of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Can I speak to you privately for a minute?
Andy Dwyer,The name is special agent Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me who you are, who you work for, and don't bother trying to lie to me, because I'm amazing."
April Ludgate,"My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf."
April Ludgate,"And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,He's not going to like it very much.
April Ludgate,So untie me!
Andy Dwyer,"Nice try, Miss Hitler, but you have something that I want."
Andy Dwyer,Where's the necklace with all of Germany's war secrets?
April Ludgate,I don't know what you are talking about.
Andy Dwyer,I think you do!
April Ludgate,I don't!
Andy Dwyer,"Now, you give me that war ending necklace, or I will resort to torture."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I will show you where it is, damn it."
April Ludgate,"You're too good, Macklin."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't you do it, Hitler."
Andy Dwyer,Don't you dare fall in love with me.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Hitler, you sexy bastard."
Andy Dwyer,No!
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,MmMm!
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Chris Traeger,I am just filled to the brim with questions.
Chris Traeger,Why are you using this wood?
Chris Traeger,Is it more pliable?
Chris Traeger,What are these metal latches?
Chris Traeger,Are they copper or brass?
Chris Traeger,Is one better?
Chris Traeger,"And if so, why?"
Ron Swanson,"If I tell you, then you won't have learned anything."
Chris Traeger,Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,"My therapist, Dr."
Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non exercise based hobbies."
Chris Traeger,So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.
Chris Traeger,I made this.
Chris Traeger,"Before I started, it was bigger."
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,I have designed something very important.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you start work on that right away?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sir!"
Ron Swanson,It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.
Ben Wyatt,Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?
Ben Wyatt,"You know who he sounds like, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.
Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,You.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've been very rude to him, and you need to apologize."
Leslie Knope,Ha ha ha.
Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,So you can kiss your park and four years of work goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,Up to you.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,You can do it.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to.
Ben Wyatt,You can You can do it.
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day."
Ben Wyatt,But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Hitler?
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize."
Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,This is Canada Dry.
Leslie Knope,Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,That's nothing.
Leslie Knope,What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sor
Leslie Knope,He's a human being.
Leslie Knope,You're a human being.
Leslie Knope,You can just just say I'm sor
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that I I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude."
Leslie Knope,It's too soon.
Wreston St. James,"You know what, as a gesture of good will, I'd like to waive my fee."
Wreston St. James,I'll design the park pro bono.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's very nice of you.
Wreston St. James,I've been working up a little model of the design.
Wreston St. James,"Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,And then you can come to our wedding.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Wreston St. James,What?
Ben Wyatt,"It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date."
April Ludgate,I was never here.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
April Ludgate,Aah!
Tom Haverford,"Well done, team."
Tom Haverford,What do you think of the place?
Ann Perkins,Do you really like this yellow paint?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it was on sale, but it looks a lot like dried phlegm."
Donna Meagle,"For real, Tom."
Donna Meagle,This place is sad.
Donna Meagle,I think one of the mannequins tried to commit suicide.
Chris Traeger,"I think what's important is we all had a goal, and we achieved it."
Ann Perkins,So you like the place?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, it's quite terrible."
Tom Haverford,This is the best I can do for now.
Tom Haverford,And I'm $46 under budget.
Tom Haverford,Now I have a small treat for you guys for all your hard work.
Tom Haverford,Pizza party!
Jerry Gergich,One small pizza for all of us.
Jerry Gergich,With no toppings.
Tom Haverford,"Cheese is a topping, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"And why are these lights blaring, by the way?"
Tom Haverford,Does someone here own stock in the electric company?
Ron Swanson,"If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party."
Andy Dwyer,"You can't run, Hitler."
Andy Dwyer,82nd airborne is everywhere!
Andy Dwyer,History channel.
Andy Dwyer,Ho ho ho!
Andy Dwyer,What is this?
Andy Dwyer,"A child spy, sent to steal the necklace?"
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI!"
Andy Dwyer,Freeze!
Extra,I didn't do anything!
April Ludgate,"Yeah, bad call, Bert."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, I'm just kidding, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,I'm just playing around.
Andy Dwyer,My name's really Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,I'm a security guard.
Andy Dwyer,What's your name?
Extra,Joey.
Extra,"I was with my mom, and I got lost."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, gosh, don't worry about that."
Andy Dwyer,"I've gotten lost here about 500 times, and I work here."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say we go find your mom, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,She's not in there.
Andy Dwyer,I'll bet.
Andy Dwyer,Let's try this way.
Extra,Hello?
Extra,"Ms. Knope, Mr. Wyatt?"
Extra,We're from Wreston St. James' firm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Where's Wreston?
Extra,He's on his way.
Extra,He wanted us to get started.
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I guess go ahead."
Extra,"We present the Crown Jewel of Pawnee containing the sights, sounds, and most importantly, smells that define your city."
Extra,There are several drool buckets for your more slackjawed citizens.
Extra,We also have food troughs full of cheeseburgers and public showers with instructions for those who've never showered before.
Leslie Knope,You have five seconds to get out of here Or I will rip your throats out.
Ben Wyatt,Out.
Ben Wyatt,Now.
Extra,"Oh, hey, my backyard is bigger than your park."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, stay back, stay back."
Leslie Knope,"I told you that Eagletonians are awful, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,They call their boogers Pawnee caviar.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm on your side, and I'm furious too."
Ben Wyatt,But this just doesn't make sense to me.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm gonna talk to Wreston, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this."
Leslie Knope,Any excuse to talk to Wreston.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am gonna think about a revenge plan."
Leslie Knope,I know what we're gonna do.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find out where he lives.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna drive to his house.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna set it on fire and watch it burn.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can't do that."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,We can't.
April Ludgate,"All right, so"
April Ludgate,Does this look familiar?
Andy Dwyer,"No, not at all."
April Ludgate,I was talking to Joey.
Extra,Joey!
Extra,Mommy!
Extra,There you are.
Extra,"Oh, God, I was so worried."
Extra,Thank you so much.
Extra,You'll never know how much I appreciate it.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, just doing my job, ma'am."
Extra,"Thank you for saving me, Andy."
Extra,"Thank you, too, miss Hitler."
Extra,What?
April Ludgate,Don't worry about it.
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,You made those losers very happy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I didn't."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin did.
April Ludgate,No
Andy Dwyer,FBI.
April Ludgate,"Actually, Bert Macklin kinda made that little boy cry."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he's a rogue agent who refuses to play by the rules."
April Ludgate,"Seriously, I think Andy Dwyer makes a better real cop than Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,Maybe it's time for Bert Macklin to hang up his shades.
Extra,Can I get you something to drink?
Ben Wyatt,"Iced tea, please."
Ben Wyatt,"And can I ask you, how are there palm trees here?"
Extra,"Well, Eagleton lies on top of a hot spring which creates a microclimate zone."
Extra,We are truly blessed.
Wreston St. James,"God, I'm so sorry I'm late."
Ben Wyatt,"What the hell happened, man?"
Wreston St. James,I had nothing to do with that stupid prank.
Wreston St. James,"In fact, that's why I'm late."
Wreston St. James,"I was firing the two people who were responsible, and I was escorting them out of the building."
Ben Wyatt,Well Good!
Wreston St. James,"Full disclosure, Certain people in the firm wanted to promote them, but I insisted they be fired."
Ben Wyatt,"If you swear to me that you're serious, maybe we can salvage this."
Wreston St. James,I would really love to.
Wreston St. James,But what about Leslie? I just doubt that she can ever get over the bad blood between our towns.
Ben Wyatt,I think you're wrong.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is a very forgiving person.
Leslie Knope,"Revenge! Ha ha hal This is for Pawnee, you buttfaced pompous jerk! Whoo! I love you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee forever! You want a stupid tie? I'll give you a stupid tie.
Leslie Knope,"Ha ha! Wreston, suck it."
Leslie Knope,Now we're even.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Huh?
Ben Wyatt,"He didn't do it, and he fired the people who did."
Tom Haverford,"Attention, please."
Tom Haverford,"I've been going over the books, and I'm missing 9 dollars."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I'm not angry at whoever took it."
Tom Haverford,Just come forward.
Tom Haverford,"You'll be served with a lawsuit, and we will move on with our lives."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, buddy, let's go get some breakfast, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,"It was your idea, so you're paying."
Tom Haverford,You're driving.
Tom Haverford,I'm not chipping in for gas.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Tom Haverford,I'll have the pancake breakfast.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, let me also get 12 eggs, uncooked, and some toast."
Tom Haverford,"20 slices, untoasted, in a row in a bag."
Extra,You want a carton of eggs and a loaf of bread.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just the pancake breakfast is fine."
Tom Haverford,Don't offer to pay if you're gonna be cheap.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, man, I know you don't want to repeat the mistakes of Entertainment 720, and that's great, but you're gonna need a little bit of the old Tom to make this business work."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,That Tom ruined everything.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, he did, and that Tom made you a horrible boyfriend and a terrible employee and drove you to bankruptcy."
Tom Haverford,Are we nearing the point?
Ann Perkins,"But your swagger and your showmanship and your confidence is part of you, and in small doses, it can help."
Ann Perkins,You can't have RentASwag without the swag.
Tom Haverford,I barely have enough cash to get everything set up.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,Take this.
Ann Perkins,We all chipped in.
Ann Perkins,Use it to spruce up the store.
Ann Perkins,And in return you can give us like one share of stock in the company.
Tom Haverford,Like a mini public offering.
Tom Haverford,"""Smort"", Ann."
Tom Haverford,Smort.
Tom Haverford,This is a cause for celebration.
Tom Haverford,"Waiter! Eight strips of bacon, uncooked, in a sealed package."
Wreston St. James,"I call it the Pawnee Commons, a celebration of Pawnee's history and people."
Leslie Knope,"A Wamapoke themed playground Food trucks from local restaurants, Li'l Sebastian fountain."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's perfect."
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I can't see myself fighting you on more than 60% of these ideas.
Wreston St. James,I'd expect no less.
Wreston St. James,I'm just glad you like it.
Wreston St. James,I've never met two people more passionate about their hometown.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm actually from Minnesota."
Wreston St. James,Why do you know so much about Pawnee?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm in love with a woman from here."
Ben Wyatt,"A strange, passionate, goof ball of a woman."
Leslie Knope,Me.
Leslie Knope,He's in love with me.
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry to see you go, Macklin."
April Ludgate,"You didn't always play by the rules, but damn it, you were a hell of an agent."
Andy Dwyer,Today I say goodbye to the only life I've ever known.
April Ludgate,"Well, some of the boys chipped in and we got you This."
April Ludgate,"It isn't much, but it's something to remember us by."
Andy Dwyer,40 years undercover.
Andy Dwyer,I never even met my family.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,And this is all I have to show for it? Totally worth it.
April Ludgate,"It's been a pleasure serving with you, son."
Andy Dwyer,"If you ever need me, you know where to find me, In bed next to you, probably having sex with you."
Tom Haverford,Welcome to the new new RentASwag now with 30% more swag.
Tom Haverford,"I used the money you guys gave me to add a little flair, and I took everything I own in my house and brought it here, except for my bed."
Tom Haverford,I basically live here now.
Ron Swanson,"I hate all of this, which probably means it's good for your business."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, my woodworking project, it's for displaying shoes!"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,That was always the plan.
Tom Haverford,"All right, RentASwag team, I have one more little surprise for you pizza party! Part Two."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow! Two pizzas."
Ann Perkins,And toppings!
Tom Haverford,Only on half.
Tom Haverford,I'm not Zuckerberg.
Tom Haverford,"Eat up, chumps."
