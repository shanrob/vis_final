Character,Line
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, the central question that these senators are going to be asking is why should we invest in the National Park Service?"
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,"Well, it is simple, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"In today's fast-paced society, National Parks are still the best place for full moon werewolf transformations."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're kidding, but I also know that you're prepared, and we are going to do great."
Leslie Knope,How psyched are you about this trip?
Leslie Knope,"April, are you super psyched?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Also, you have lipstick on your teeth."
Leslie Knope,I do?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,We're a great team.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I know what's going on in your head."
April Ludgate,Oh!
April Ludgate,"Well, then, welcome to the Terrordome."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You need to tell Leslie that you want to leave your job.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,She freaks out when anything changes.
April Ludgate,"One time, Andy told her that I was getting rid of my bangs and she called 911."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I can't keep your secret much longer."
Ben Wyatt,"Any time your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot until she gets bored."
April Ludgate,"So, you talk for one second?"
Ben Wyatt,You're going to spend the next couple of days with her.
Ben Wyatt,"If you talk to her directly and honestly, she can be surprisingly open minded."
April Ludgate,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Leslie?
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking about changing the font on the itineraries. What do you think?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,On what grounds?
Leslie Knope,Those-- those fonts are perfect.
Leslie Knope,It's readable and compact.
Leslie Knope,It's all on one page.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,Don't mess with that.
Leslie Knope,"I appreciate your initiative, but itineraries are not the right place to mess around."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"April, I told you that was an absurd idea."
April Ludgate,I don't care what Ben says.
April Ludgate,I'm not going to tell Leslie I'm leaving my job on this trip.
April Ludgate,She'll drown me in the Potomac while she recites facts about the Potomac.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, don't fret, cookie."
Andy Dwyer,"We've made progress, haven't we?"
Andy Dwyer,We've got a whole list of all the things you need out of a new job.
Andy Dwyer,"Apple juice, barbecue sauce, Count Chocula-- Wait."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,That's the list of cool new nicknames I want people to call me.
Andy Dwyer,Here's your list.
April Ludgate,How can I tell her I'm leaving when I don't even know what job I want?
April Ludgate,Babe.
April Ludgate,I wish you were coming with me.
Andy Dwyer,I just decided what I'm going to do while April is out of town.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to round up the team and find her a new job.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Ben Wyatt, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Tell him it's Count Chocula.
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's Andrew Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ron Swanson,"So, April wants to leave."
Ron Swanson,I always knew she would tire of government.
Ron Swanson,Took long enough.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, both me and Ben are trying to help April find a new job, and we thought maybe she could work for you."
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like it would be a perfect fit, although I don't know exactly what you guys do here."
Andy Dwyer,I'm guessing it's a business?
Andy Dwyer,Assassins?
Andy Dwyer,Hit men?
Andy Dwyer,Doctors.
Andy Dwyer,You guys are doctors?
Ron Swanson,We build things.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, let me show you around."
Ron Swanson,This is a door.
Ron Swanson,"These, of course, are walls."
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Ron Swanson,"Meet our vice president, Don Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Don, this is Andrew and Benjamin."
Don Swanson,Pleasure to meet you.
Ben Wyatt,Is this your brother?
Ben Wyatt,You have a brother?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, suppose the cat's out of the bag."
Ron Swanson,I have a brother.
Ron Swanson,One brother.
Andy Dwyer,"All those years together at the Parks Department, and you never told us you had a brother."
Don Swanson,You worked at the Parks Department?
Ron Swanson,Tour is over.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Carryon bags packed, trashy magazines purchased, boarding passes in hand, and we have 26 minutes for unstructured chat time."
Leslie Knope,What do you want to talk about?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.
Leslie Knope,You want to talk about your future?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I've actually been thinking about that a lot lately.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I figured."
Leslie Knope,It's hard at your age to figure out your path.
April Ludgate,I know.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck."
Leslie Knope,It's unstructured chat time.
Leslie Knope,So Tada!
Leslie Knope,"This is your clear, definitive path through the federal government."
Leslie Knope,It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.
Leslie Knope,"Cool, right?"
April Ludgate,Wow!
April Ludgate,This is intense.
Leslie Knope,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, with this, you don't have to worry."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I feel so relaxed.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
April Ludgate,What's up with these shirts?
Leslie Knope,Gov Buds for Life?
Leslie Knope,"Just a little fun I was having, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't really make the shirts.
April Ludgate,"But did you, though?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
April Ludgate,"Oh, and also, I have a middle seat."
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,Group One is boarding.
Andy Dwyer,Break it down.
Andy Dwyer,What will she be doing at this job?
Ron Swanson,"Well, she'd have about six people reporting to her."
Ron Swanson,"If she started soon, she could project manage our new warehouse in Snerling."
Ben Wyatt,"""Get to be my own boss."""
Ben Wyatt,"So far, so good."
Ben Wyatt,"She also wants ""passionate interest in subject matter."""
Ben Wyatt,"So, what kind of building is it?"
Ron Swanson,It's a largescale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, that's boring."
Andy Dwyer,"Would she have an opportunity to practice any ""creative problem solving""?"
Ron Swanson,Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.
Ron Swanson,"Although I suppose she could use ""creative"" ways to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting."
Ron Swanson,"No, that's insane."
Ron Swanson,We use the Towsend Method.
Ron Swanson,It's tried and true.
Ben Wyatt,I think this might be a dead end.
Ron Swanson,I think you might be right.
Ron Swanson,But getting a good person out of government is a worthwhile endeavor.
Ron Swanson,I will help.
Ron Swanson,"But first, I'm going to need some grub."
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Let's grab some lunch and some ice cream and then maybe some after ice cream tacos.
Andy Dwyer,We'll just brainstorm.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe grab some snacks.
Ron Swanson,Vaughn.
Ron Swanson,Lon.
Vaughn Swanson,Ron.
Lon Swanson,Ron.
Randy,"Okay, I think we're all set."
Randy,"Even though I'm taking the lead on these meetings, don't be afraid to jump in."
Leslie Knope,Copy that.
Leslie Knope,"April, when Randy brings up the river project, that is your cue toâ¦"
April Ludgate,Distract the guard so the Hamburglar can make his escape.
Randy,We're meeting with a lot of senators today.
Randy,Is she going to be okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's just April.
Leslie Knope,Trust me.
April Ludgate,And we hope you agree that this is the best plan to preserve National Parks' funding into the next decade.
Barbara Boxer,"Well, so, Leslie, what do you think?"
Barbara Boxer,Is this the right move?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think it's the only move, Senator Boxer."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this chance is going to come around again.
Barbara Boxer,"Well, you know, if it's good with Leslie, it's good with me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have another great idea."
Leslie Knope,"How about you and me, April, Randy, ""Historical Lampposts of D.C."" walking tour?"
Leslie Knope,Starts in 15 minutes.
Barbara Boxer,"Sounds great, but I do have an appointment with the President."
Leslie Knope,Can we come?
Andy Dwyer,What kind of a business is this?
Andy Dwyer,"Is it, like, hit man or astronauts?"
Ben Wyatt,It's an accounting firm.
Ben Wyatt,But they recently opened up a consulting wing.
Ben Wyatt,And consulting is perfect for April.
Ron Swanson,You think this Barney fellow will listen to what we have to say?
Barney,Ben!
Barney,Ben is here.
Barney,"Hi, Ben."
Barney,Ted!
Barney,Ben is here!
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"It is ""actuarily"" very good to see you guys."
Barney,Ben!
Ben Wyatt,They like me here.
Barney,You've got to hear this.
Randy,"So, we think we can keep costs down and still meet deadlines."
Kirsten Gillibrand,I have to say I'm really impressed with what you guys are doing over at Interior.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand."
Leslie Knope,We really appreciate your support.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind signing a copy of your book?
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Leslie Knope,I took the liberty of writing the inscription.
Leslie Knope,All you have to do is sign.
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""To Leslie, my inspiration, my muse, my partner in crime."""
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""I owe it all to you."""
Leslie Knope,And there's room for a P.S. If you feel there's more you left out.
Kirsten Gillibrand,"Well, I think I've said all I want to say right here."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Kirsten Gillibrand,Okay.
John McCain,"Yeah, but I can't do that right now."
John McCain,"Oh, boy."
John McCain,I'll call you back.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Senator."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a minute to chat?
John McCain,"Well, I can't right now."
John McCain,I've got a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you Actually, I checked with your staff, and they said that you have a free half hour."
John McCain,Did anyone ever tell you that your tenacity can be intimidating?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Every month of my life since fourth grade.
Leslie Knope,"Now, let's talk about National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to say I'm very surprised that the two of you are seeing eye to eye on this one."
Orrin Hatch,"Well, Senator Booker and I are both concerned about our nation's resources, and that absolutely includes our National Parks."
Cory Booker,But that's not all we have in common.
Cory Booker,"In fact, our real passion is Polynesian folk music."
Orrin Hatch,Polynesian folk music.
Leslie Knope,What?
Orrin Hatch,Polynesian folk music.
Orrin Hatch,Our band is playing in Georgetown tonight if you'd like to come.
Orrin Hatch,"We're called ""Across the Isle."""
Cory Booker,Did you get that?
Cory Booker,"""Isle""?"
Cory Booker,"""Isle"" like an island and then ""across the aisle""?"
Cory Booker,"The political ""aisle""?"
Cory Booker,"It's, like, a pun."
Cory Booker,It's a play on words.
Leslie Knope,I do get it.
April Ludgate,We are definitely coming to this.
Orrin Hatch,It's 8 dollars if you buy your tickets now.
Orrin Hatch,It's 10 dollars at the door.
Cory Booker,A fiscal conservative.
Cory Booker,Love this guy.
Cory Booker,Love this guy.
Orrin Hatch,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,April Ludgate-Dwyer.
Ron Swanson,She worked on the Gryzzl deal that you guys did the finances for.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I know that you're opening up a consulting wing, and I just think that April would be a great hire."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and here's the thing, Barney."
Andy Dwyer,We're obviously very familiar with what consulting is.
Andy Dwyer,But why don't you go ahead and tell my friends here.
Andy Dwyer,Because I don't think that they know.
Barney,"Well, it's really about finding creative solutions to difficult problems."
Barney,"Now, a lot of times, there's firing."
Barney,"So, consultants aren't exactly well liked."
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap.
Andy Dwyer,"This is the job for her, I can feel it."
Andy Dwyer,She'll take it.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, let's talk perks."
Andy Dwyer,Does she get the summer off?
Andy Dwyer,Is it like school?
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Barney,"Well, what did she major in?"
Barney,Economics?
Barney,Accounting?
Andy Dwyer,"She designed her own major, Halloween Studies."
Ben Wyatt,"Trust me, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,She's brilliant and a very fast learner.
Ben Wyatt,Does that compound your interest?
Ben Wyatt,Huh?
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,"Huh, Barney?"
Barney,"Ben, that was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Barney,But it's too late for her to apply.
Barney,"I'm sorry, but we're not really taking any more applicants."
Barney,Though I could make an exception for someone else.
Andy Dwyer,Not interested.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, five yeses and four noes."
Leslie Knope,Not a bad start.
Randy,"So, Leslie, I was going to talk to you about this in a few weeks, but Mike Norbert is retiring."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Old Norbs is stepping down.
Leslie Knope,"Couldn't handle the pressure, huh?"
Leslie Knope,What a wuss.
Randy,His marriage is falling apart.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Randy,She had an affair with his best friend.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I feel bad about what I said before.
Randy,Yeah.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,"So, anyway."
Randy,"Good news for you is, we'd like to promote you to Deputy Director of Operations at Interior."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Randy,"You'd have to move to D.C., , and you'd have to complete the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program."
Leslie Knope,I have to enroll in SESCDP?
Leslie Knope,Forty four weeks of intensive courses and notetaking?
Leslie Knope,"Um, it's a dream come true."
Randy,"And I have to warn you, there will be a confirmation hearing."
Leslie Knope,A confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,A freaking confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me a second.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"To the best of my recollection, yes, I accept the job."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,Do you mind if I borrow your hat?
Leslie Knope,I just want to throw it up in the air victoriously.
Extra,No.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Ben Wyatt,I think that job is perfect for April.
Ben Wyatt,We just have to convince Barney to give her a shot.
Ben Wyatt,"First problem, she's not as qualified as the other applicants."
Andy Dwyer,Simple solution?
Andy Dwyer,I break into her college and I change her degree to accounting.
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,"On my way out, look up at the blackboard."
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Andy Dwyer,Impossible math equation?
Andy Dwyer,I solve it.
Andy Dwyer,"X equals Y, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,"Professor comes up to me, he says, ""I've been working on that for 50 years."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Why don't you accept this math trophy?"""
Andy Dwyer,"By the time he turns around, I'm gone."
Ron Swanson,We need to highlight April's strengths.
Ron Swanson,I thought we could update her resume.
Ron Swanson,This is the one she applied to Parks with.
Ron Swanson,It's just a signed photograph of a puppet named Alf.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so we make her an actual resume, then put on a big presentation, show Barney that she's more than qualified."
Ben Wyatt,We're going to need all hands on deck.
Ben Wyatt,"That's Craig, Donna, and most importantly--"
Ron Swanson,"Please, no."
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Don't do it.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,You want to photocopy?
Ben Wyatt,You guys want to do all the mindless work?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
Ben Wyatt,Get me Garry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Look around, April."
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
April Ludgate,Fountains.
April Ludgate,Water.
April Ludgate,Sky.
April Ludgate,You.
April Ludgate,Looking at me like a crazy person.
Leslie Knope,I see a new home.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to take that job, Ben's going to run for Congress, he will win eventually, and then we're going to split our time between Washington and Pawnee."
April Ludgate,That's great.
April Ludgate,It looks like everything is falling into place for you.
Leslie Knope,"For us, April."
Leslie Knope,For us.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,What is that over there?
April Ludgate,A lamppost?
April Ludgate,"Is that historic, do you think?"
Leslie Knope,"No, they put that in in the '70s."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am so ahead of my five year plan."
Leslie Knope,Which means that you're going to need a new five year plan.
Leslie Knope,And here it is.
April Ludgate,"Ow, it's hot."
April Ludgate,How did you make this so fast?
Leslie Knope,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.C.
Leslie Knope,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench."
Leslie Knope,"April, we have a bench in D.C."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
April Ludgate,I can't do this anymore.
April Ludgate,I don't want to work in government.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You quit?
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"Because honestly, I don't even know if I like working in National Parks."
April Ludgate,Or government.
April Ludgate,"I just fell backwards into your world, and years have gone by."
April Ludgate,"And now, I'm here."
April Ludgate,And Andy and Ben have been helping me look into different jobs to figure out what I really want to do.
Leslie Knope,Ben who?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,He's been helping you behind my back?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We had a good run.
Leslie Knope,But he's dead to me now.
April Ludgate,"It's just, I've been on this weird path my entire adult life, and I need to figure out what I really want."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you're quitting.
Leslie Knope,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.
Leslie Knope,"And on our bench, of all places."
Leslie Knope,It's just so frustrating.
Leslie Knope,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?"
Leslie Knope,"It's like, what's the point, you know?"
Madeleine Albright,"Wow, Leslie."
Madeleine Albright,I haven't seen you this upset since you almost forgot Ann's half birthday.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Madeleine Albright,Tell me.
Madeleine Albright,How many times have we had lunch?
Leslie Knope,Five.
Leslie Knope,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with mini muffins."
Madeleine Albright,And why have we had lunch so many times?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend."
Madeleine Albright,"I'm so glad that you did, and you are a wonderful friend."
Madeleine Albright,"But sometimes, you're so focused and driven that you forget about people's feelings."
Leslie Knope,Name one time I've done that.
Madeleine Albright,"Well, you were so wrapped up in your story that you actually ate my waffle."
Madeleine Albright,"Sometimes, all you can do is give people a little bit of advice and a push."
Madeleine Albright,But you have to realize April has to be able to make up her own mind.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright."
Madeleine Albright,Can I have my pin back now?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for letting me wear it.
Leslie Knope,It just makes me feel very powerful.
Madeleine Albright,"Me, too."
Craig Middlebrooks,Resume's done.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I used bullet points instead of numbers, because I find it conveys strength and competence."
Donna Meagle,A binder of her accomplishments.
Donna Meagle,Photos of her getting the job done.
Donna Meagle,"And 500 dollars cash, in case you want to go the straightup bribe route."
Ben Wyatt,Donna.
Donna Meagle,"You put me on the team, I find a way to win."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Copies are made.
Jerry Gergich,"Everything has been collated and stapled, and all the research has been doublechecked."
Jerry Gergich,I went through quite a few staples.
Craig Middlebrooks,I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And this guy better appreciate it, because I do not compare people to Mary J. Blige lightly."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, no one should."
Craig Middlebrooks,Do you want to go to dinner tonight?
Donna Meagle,I do not.
Craig Middlebrooks,Respect.
Jerry Gergich,I'm free.
Craig Middlebrooks,I have plans.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, great job, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"With all this, Barney will at least have to give her a shot."
Andy Dwyer,"Sure, they did a good job, but this isn't enough."
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about it all day.
Andy Dwyer,And I have a plan to go the extra mile and make April seem like the ideal candidate.
Andy Dwyer,Give me the job!
Andy Dwyer,"My name's April Ludgate, and my talent is explosive."
Andy Dwyer,Go USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,When should I tell April to show up?
Barney,My car.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, I had to miss the ""Memorable Rain Gutters of Washington"" walking tour, so this better be good."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy."
Leslie Knope,"If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it."
April Ludgate,"Okay, turn around."
Leslie Knope,What? Why?
April Ludgate,Because I'm about to say something serious and I can't do it if I have to look you in the eye.
April Ludgate,Please.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Now, take your shoes off and wear them like mittens."
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry."
April Ludgate,"When I started working for you, I was aimless and just thought everything was stupid and lame."
April Ludgate,And you turned me into someone with goals and ambition.
April Ludgate,Which is really the only reason why I'm even thinking about what I really want.
April Ludgate,And I just want to say thank you.
April Ludgate,And I love you very much.
April Ludgate,Which is why I have decided not to turn you into a sea urchin.
April Ludgate,Which I could do because I am an actual witch with powers and I'm evil--
Leslie Knope,I know.
April Ludgate,And I hate everything.
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, April."
Leslie Knope,"So, you don't have any idea what you want to do?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, here's the good news."
Leslie Knope,I am on the case.
Leslie Knope,I know some people who might be able to help us.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation."
Leslie Knope,"They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands of jobs across America that help communities."
Leslie Knope,"Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,I found this crazy woman on the street and she won't leave me alone.
Alyssa,"Oh, I'm very familiar with Leslie's enthusiasm."
Leslie Knope,They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.
Alyssa,"Two days later, we had set up the entire program, and she sent me a throw pillow with my face stitched onto it."
Leslie Knope,Not my best work.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you changed your hair."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to send you another one.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go solve all of your career problems.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait right here.
April Ludgate,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,That a girl.
April Ludgate,Ugh! Mom.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Madeleine."
Leslie Knope,"They're taking forever, and I'm starting to lose it."
Leslie Knope,"Talk to me, okay? Your voice makes me calm."
Leslie Knope,Tell me another Yeltsin story.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, she's here."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Say hi to your daughters.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
April Ludgate,I'm great.
April Ludgate,I know exactly what I want to do.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Is it Teach for America? No.
Leslie Knope,Habitat for Humanity? No.
Leslie Knope,It's working with animals.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,I want to work here.
April Ludgate,At the Foundation.
April Ludgate,I want to be like Alyssa.
April Ludgate,"I want to tell people what to do, and then send them far away from me."
April Ludgate,It's perfect.
April Ludgate,And it hits everything on my list.
April Ludgate,"Creative problem solving, working one-on-one--"
Leslie Knope,"I am 100,000% in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,This is an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope,I love this idea.
Leslie Knope,And I love you.
Leslie Knope,"So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her?"
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate,I didn't tell her yet.
April Ludgate,I wanted to see if you thought it was a good idea first.
April Ludgate,What? Bad idea?
Leslie Knope,You wanted to run something by me?
April Ludgate,Oh My God.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"So, will you help me?"
Leslie Knope,"April, you don't need me."
Leslie Knope,You can get any job you want all by yourself.
Leslie Knope,"Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything."
Leslie Knope,But you can get this sucker on your own.
Andy Dwyer,"So, long story short, we might have found you the perfect job."
Andy Dwyer,"But also, I might have blown it."
Andy Dwyer,Ben and Ron are there now to try to fix it.
Andy Dwyer,"And if they don't, I feel like it's kind of on them."
April Ludgate,Everyone is being so nice to me lately.
April Ludgate,It's weird.
April Ludgate,I feel like I need to take a shower in pig's blood to wash all the niceness off me.
