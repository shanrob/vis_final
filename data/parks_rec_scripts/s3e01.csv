Leslie Knope,We're back.
Ron Swanson,Bully.
Leslie Knope,"The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing."
Leslie Knope,I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Leslie Knope,"Rounding up the team, so exciting."
Leslie Knope,I have goose bumps.
Leslie Knope,Feel.
Tom Haverford,And that's why they call me Prince Charming.
Tom Haverford,Because I always find the glass slipper for my Cinderella.

Leslie Knope,Come on!
Tom Haverford,I called shotgun.
Tom Haverford,Everybody heard me.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am usually not one for speeches."
Ron Swanson,"So, goodbye."
Leslie Knope,"Break's over, mofos."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Leslie Knope,Park services have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,But we are all still here.
Leslie Knope,And we have a job to do.
Tom Haverford,Make the world's biggest pizza.
Leslie Knope,"No, make this town fun for the people who live here."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, but after that, the pizza is our top priority."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,We're getting pizza?
Andy Dwyer,"April, hey, it's me, Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"This is like the 200th message I've left you, without a response."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you're trying to tell me something, I do not know what it is because you won't call me back."
Chris Traeger,"It is truly great to see all of you, huh?"
Chris Traeger,It's great news!
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,I have to run.
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"The bad news, which I get to deliver, is this."
Ben Wyatt,Your only work for the time being will be existing park maintenance.
Ben Wyatt,"So, that just means that we're in maintenance mode."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,There is one thing that you will be doing.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, in Indiana, if you don't provide a basketball league, people get very upset."
Ben Wyatt,"And quite frankly, throw things at you and call you names."
Ben Wyatt,Like Turdboy.
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,The point is I reinstated youth basketball.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,It says here you only have money for two teams?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,They're going to develop a great rivalry.
Ron Swanson,"Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys into men, from men into gladiators, and from gladiators into Swansons."
Ron Swanson,Behold!
Ron Swanson,The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.
Ron Swanson,I've been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
Ron Swanson,It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement.
Ron Swanson,Categories include Capitalism.
Ron Swanson,"God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor."
Ron Swanson,Crying.
Ron Swanson,Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.
Ron Swanson,Rage.
Ron Swanson,Poise.
Ron Swanson,Property rights.
Ron Swanson,"Fish, for sport only, not for meat."
Ron Swanson,Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Ron Swanson,Haircuts.
Ron Swanson,There are three acceptable haircuts.
Ron Swanson,High and tight.
Ron Swanson,Crew cut.
Ron Swanson,Buzz cut.
Ron Swanson,"Are the scissors broken in your house, son?"
Ann Perkins,"So, are you happy to be back at work?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, our budget's been slashed to zero."
Leslie Knope,I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Leslie Knope,Request denied.
Leslie Knope,We literally can't buy shit.
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects."
Leslie Knope,"Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not a paper pusher, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,How are my two favorite people in this entire town?
Leslie Knope,"Not good, Chris."
Leslie Knope,There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I know, it's terrible."
Chris Traeger,Is there anything we can do about that?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Ann, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, how's it going?"
Leslie Knope,Save it.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,Go the other way.
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm just going to that-- All right, I'II..."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I'm very flattered."
Ann Perkins,"But again, I don't think I should go out with you."
Chris Traeger,Can I ask you why not?
Chris Traeger,Because I thought we had a great time the night you got drunk and kissed me.
Chris Traeger,And you did use your tongue.
Ann Perkins,I just don't think I'm in a place to go out with anyone right now.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Did he ask you out again?
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,He is nothing if not persistent.
Ann Perkins,And hot.
Ann Perkins,He's very... He's pretty hot.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's intense.
Ann Perkins,"But he's really, really hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's your boss.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does?
Leslie Knope,Minus the money?
Ann Perkins,"Definitely yes, then."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann."
Ron Swanson,Looking sharp.
Ron Swanson,Beautiful.
Ron Swanson,The backboard is your friend.
Andy Dwyer,"I'd say my coaching style is centered around fundamentals, with an emphasis on fun."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, watch this."
Andy Dwyer,Go get it.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,And a second emphasis on mental.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it can be hard work."
Andy Dwyer,But every time I look one of these kids in the eyes and he calls me Coach... That's how I know I agreed to be a coach.
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, gentlemen."
Tom Haverford,It's time for the pregame coin toss.
Ron Swanson,There's no coin toss in basketball.
Ron Swanson,Are those women's sneakers?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, they are, Ron."
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,"They fit better, I got an employee discount, and the best part is no one can tell."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's do this."
Tom Haverford,Match point.
Tom Haverford,Touchdown.
Tom Haverford,Et cetera.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, Lightning."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier."
Leslie Knope,Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time?
Ann Perkins,"Or, like, a metal bikini?"
Leslie Knope,You know what's always sexy?
Leslie Knope,Fingerless gloves.
Ann Perkins,"What about if I wear this normal, sane outfit?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then."
Leslie Knope,Like a banana.
Ann Perkins,For dinner?
Leslie Knope,"Well, what's sexy food?"
Leslie Knope,Asparagus?
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what's sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Turkey chili.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And how exactly am I supposed to casually steer the conversation towards the Parks Department budget?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's totally easy.
Leslie Knope,Tell you what.
Leslie Knope,You be Chris.
Leslie Knope,I'll be you.
Leslie Knope,I'll show you how it's done.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,You are wonderful and amazing and I'm happy to be here with you.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Ann Perkins,Can I get you a drink?
Ann Perkins,I love every single beverage in the world.
Leslie Knope,I would like some wine.
Leslie Knope,"And... Oops, my vest popped open."
Leslie Knope,Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Chris Traeger,I am so excited that you finally agreed to go out with me.
Chris Traeger,What a magnificent flip-flop.
Leslie Knope,You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Chris Traeger,Tell me every single detail of your day.
Chris Traeger,I love dates.
Chris Traeger,I love connecting with someone.
Chris Traeger,I love engaging them.
Chris Traeger,I love being surprised by them.
Chris Traeger,I have never had a bad date.
Chris Traeger,They've all been either great or phenomenally great.
Chris Traeger,Nurses are the most undervalued members of our society by far.
Chris Traeger,I think all of you should make as much money as the CEO of Google.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I agree.
Ann Perkins,Can I ask you a question?
Chris Traeger,Why am I so positive all the time?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's exactly the question."
Chris Traeger,I was born with a blood disorder.
Chris Traeger,And my parents were told that I had three weeks to live.
Chris Traeger,"And here I still am, some 2,000 odd weeks later, and I have enjoyed every one of them."
Ann Perkins,I think it's going well.
Ann Perkins,He's actually a really nice guy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, have you asked him yet about the money?"
Ann Perkins,"It's a date, you know?"
Ann Perkins,It's kind of hard to casually bring up the Parks budget when you're talking about your favorite movies.
Leslie Knope,Jurassic Park.
Leslie Knope,Parks are so great.
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department needs money.
Leslie Knope,I just did it in three moves.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, why don't you just come here and do it yourself?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Holy crap!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here?"
Chris Traeger,We are on a date.
Chris Traeger,And it is going phenomenally.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink."
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about--"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, well, well."
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Chris Traeger,What a fun surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, you were coming here tonight on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"And hey, Leslie is joining you on this wonderfully romantic occasion."
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Chris Traeger,Fantastic!
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,"Just confirming a suspicion I had, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I had nothing to do with this date.
Leslie Knope,They're both so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,They probably just want to see each other naked.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I know what you're trying to do, and you're not that good at being sneaky."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,I'm great at being sneaky.
Ben Wyatt,"Clearly, you're not."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"You guys, let's all have dinner together."
Chris Traeger,The more the merrier.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"Great job, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Eric."
Andy Dwyer,"Taking a rest, or are you hurt?"
Andy Dwyer,Taking a rest?
Andy Dwyer,Smart.
Ron Swanson,"Destroy them, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,Feel no sympathy.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, Ron Swanson is dating my exwife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,Big deal.
Tom Haverford,"My girlfriend, Lucy, is the sexiest woman in town."
Tom Haverford,"She's Cuban, she's got tattoos, and she's into me, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the sexiest quality a woman can have."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,You know what would be really fun?
Leslie Knope,"After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park."
Chris Traeger,Walking in parks can be very romantic.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you two are on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I should probably get going."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm actually having a good time with everyone."
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,I'm having a fantastic time.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say we take this whole ""date plus two other people"" thing up into the stratosphere?"
Chris Traeger,This place is outstanding!
Chris Traeger,"Great call, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,Look.
Chris Traeger,Even Ben's dancing.
Ron Swanson,"That's the way to shoot the ball, Chignoli."
Ron Swanson,Hustle back.
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,On whom?
Tom Haverford,Your team.
Tom Haverford,Number 50.
Tom Haverford,He was double dribbling.
Ron Swanson,He's on defense.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,That's a technical difficulty.
Tom Haverford,"So, that means Andy's team throws the ball from the stripey thing."
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Ron Swanson,"""The stripey thing""?"
Extra,"Hey, there, how's it going?"
Chris Traeger,"Great, thanks."
Extra,Can I buy you a drink?
Chris Traeger,I'm very flattered.
Chris Traeger,"But this is my stunningly gorgeous date, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,Sorry.
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,"In fact, let me buy all of you a drink for being so welcoming today."
Chris Traeger,Waiter!
Ann Perkins,I think I may actually like Chris.
Extra,"On the house, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sort of a gay hero.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay."
Ben Wyatt,Penguin wedding?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,That's cute.
Leslie Knope,It was so cute.
Leslie Knope,But enough about how cute it was.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you think I should have the money?
Ben Wyatt,Good Lord.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18 and I became mayor of my hometown, I used every last dollar we had to open a giant winter sports complex."
Ben Wyatt,Called it Ice Town.
Leslie Knope,And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, kind of."
Ben Wyatt,"It was never completed, and I got impeached."
Ben Wyatt,"The newspaper headline was, ""Ice Town Costs Ice Clown His Town Crown."""
Ben Wyatt,They were big into rhymes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I think Ice Town sounds great.
Leslie Knope,"And the point is, at least you tried something."
Tom Haverford,Foul!
Tom Haverford,Foul on number three for taking a number two on number four.
Tom Haverford,Roughing the passer!
Tom Haverford,Double dribbling!
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Tom Haverford,That's a foul for touching the basketball.
Tom Haverford,What are you going to do about it?
Tom Haverford,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,You fouled.
Tom Haverford,You can't do anything.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,"What's the matter there, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,No players left?
Tom Haverford,Andy's team!
Tom Haverford,Look at them go!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,"Now, you're openly cheering for the other team?"
Ron Swanson,Put my boys back in.
Tom Haverford,You made me the ref.
Tom Haverford,Deal with it.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Take this uniform off.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Ron Swanson,You don't deserve to wear it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's ejected for molesting the ref!
Ron Swanson,Yeah?
Ron Swanson,I'm ejected?
Wendy,"Tom, what are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, you are."
Tom Haverford,I'm ejecting you.
Tom Haverford,"You're ejected, too."
Tom Haverford,Everyone's ejected.
Ron Swanson,She's ejected?
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,"Go ahead, go!"
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a forfeit."
Tom Haverford,Andy's team wins.
Andy Dwyer,No way!
Andy Dwyer,We won?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man!"
Andy Dwyer,Eat it!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,It feels good.
Andy Dwyer,And it feels sticky.
Andy Dwyer,From the Gatorade.
Leslie Knope,We're barely able to function.
Leslie Knope,We could really use that money.
Chris Traeger,"Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Mission accomplished.
Leslie Knope,Let's boogie.
Chris Traeger,Mission accomplished?
Leslie Knope,Yeah. There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
Leslie Knope,"It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's."
Leslie Knope,We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
Leslie Knope,"So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,I've just had my first bad date.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ben Wyatt,Not that sneaky.
Andy Dwyer,"April! April! Where have you been? Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,How are you?
April Ludgate,I'm okay.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dying to see you.
Andy Dwyer,"I called and I texted you, like, a billion times."
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,I was in Venezuela.
Andy Dwyer,Really? Wow.
Andy Dwyer,Across the pond.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.
Andy Dwyer,Because of what happened.
Andy Dwyer,Ann kissing me? I am so sorry about that.
Andy Dwyer,It was so stupid and it meant nothing.
April Ludgate,I wouldn't worry about it.
April Ludgate,It's totally fine.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Eduardo."
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's not."
April Ludgate,That means we're going to lunch.
Andy Dwyer,"How do you say, ""Have a great time, don't choke on anything""?"
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ann Perkins,Leslie asked me to do her a favor.
Ann Perkins,"And I love her, so I did it."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow."
Ann Perkins,I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins,Let's go out again.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,Budget solution number 28.
Leslie Knope,Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Leslie Knope,Note.
Leslie Knope,Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I got my answer."
Andy Dwyer,About April.
Andy Dwyer,She hates me.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"And she got a boyfriend, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,From some city in Mexico.
Andy Dwyer,So what do I do?
Leslie Knope,"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it."
Leslie Knope,You go big or you go home.
Leslie Knope,And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not.
Andy Dwyer,I don't even really have a home.
Leslie Knope,"Go get her, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us."
Leslie Knope,My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
Leslie Knope,And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
April Ludgate,Check your testicles?
Leslie Knope,No. Not that.
Leslie Knope,Although that is very good advice.
Leslie Knope,"Looking at you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What's going to save us is right there.
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight."
Leslie Knope,"But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die."
Leslie Knope,And we refuse to let that happen.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,This town was historically known for two things.
Leslie Knope,"Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
Leslie Knope,"And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps."
Leslie Knope,"We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts."
Leslie Knope,And I propose we bring the festival back.
Leslie Knope,"With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back."
Leslie Knope,"And believe me, people will come."
Ben Wyatt,What if they don't?
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department."
Ben Wyatt,And you guys are all on board with this.
Ron Swanson,Aye.
Everyone,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we're not just pencil pushers."
Leslie Knope,We are a reflection of the community.
Leslie Knope,And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Leslie Knope,"Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together."
Chris Traeger,"That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard."
Chris Traeger,And a good idea.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,Excellent! Great! Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, April."
Andy Dwyer,Do you like the flowers?
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"All due respect, Eduardo. You seem like a great guy."
Andy Dwyer,But I like April.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Andy Dwyer,"So, do you want to go out with me? No."
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to say yes.
Andy Dwyer,But that's okay.
Andy Dwyer,Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.
Andy Dwyer,And again the next day.
Andy Dwyer,And the next day.
Andy Dwyer,Not Friday.
Andy Dwyer,I have to go visit my cousin.
Andy Dwyer,But I will be back after that to ask you again.
Eduardo,You should do it.
Eduardo,Follow your dream.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Really? That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I'll see you tomorrow.
