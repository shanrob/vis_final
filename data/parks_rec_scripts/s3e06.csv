Leslie Knope,"Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first?"
Leslie Knope,I think it should be me and then you.
Leslie Knope,"But, if you want, it could be you and then me."
Leslie Knope,"Or it could go me, you, me."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Ron Swanson,How about just you?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back."
Leslie Knope,"And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse."
Ron Swanson,I couldn't care less about the commendation.
Ron Swanson,"But Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state."
Ron Swanson,I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there.
Ron Swanson,June 2004.
Ron Swanson,"Porterhouse, medium rare, Bearnaise sauce."
Ron Swanson,January 2000.
Ron Swanson,"They call this one ""The Enforcer."""
Ron Swanson,February '96.
Ron Swanson,"The steak, rib eye."
Ron Swanson,"The whiskey, Lagavulin 16."
Ron Swanson,"The lady next to me, a bitch."
Ron Swanson,"Specifically, my ex-wife, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, this is the first time I ever went there."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look at me."
Ron Swanson,I'm just a kid.
Leslie Knope,"She's showing some elephant-- Ooh, la la."
Leslie Knope,Look who's fancy.
Tom Haverford,Am I wearing an ascot?
Tom Haverford,I didn't notice.
Tom Haverford,Big night at the Snakehole Lounge!
Tom Haverford,"It's a launch party for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance, Allergic for Men."
Tom Haverford,Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein is a real up-and-comer in the world of microbrewed perfumes and body sprays.
Tom Haverford,"His ether based perfume, Blackout, was named one of Maxim's top hundred ways to trick someone into sex."
Tom Haverford,"Club opens at 6:00, event starts at 9:00."
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, way too late."
Jerry Gergich,I will be deep into my bath by then.
Leslie Knope,Don't let us picture that.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you gonna go?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't think so.
Ben Wyatt,"Probably just gonna take it easy, but thank you."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they always ask me to go out with them."
Ben Wyatt,They're just being polite.
Ben Wyatt,"I move around a lot, so the friends I make in these cities, they're like Facebook friends, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,"""Hey, Doug from Bloomington is thinking about buying a shirt."""
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, Doug, who cares?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that anti-histamine party."
Tom Haverford,"It's ""Allergic,"" and forget it."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't know anybody in town.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing."
Tom Haverford,"He's a fully grown man, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,And tonight's just not about pleasure.
Tom Haverford,"I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein so I can pitch him my new cologne, Tommy Fresh."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall."
Tom Haverford,Deal.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Andy Dwyer,So my band's working on a new album.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah?"
April Ludgate,What's it called?
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate is the Best Ever, Volume One."
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,"So, what do you wanna do tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,We could watch TV at Burly's house or we could watch TV at your house.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, I mean, we could watch TV at Best Buy."
April Ludgate,Why don't we go to Tom's thing?
April Ludgate,That weird cologne party thing at the Snakehole?
Andy Dwyer,I kind of forgot that you need money when you have a girlfriend.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna treat April like a queen, and queens deserve flowers and massages, chocolate, booze, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, them treasure chests full of scarves, different kinds of lubes that warm up when you rub 'em on stuff."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna give her all that stuff.
Andy Dwyer,And more.
Andy Dwyer,That sounds pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, let's do it."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I guess we're dating.
April Ludgate,It's new.
April Ludgate,Whatever!
April Ludgate,I don't like labels.
April Ludgate,Go away.
Leslie Knope,This?
Ann Perkins,That would be good.
Leslie Knope,"But does it say, ""Hello, general assembly, I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation?"""
Ann Perkins,As much as any one dress could.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I think Chris is cheating on me."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That lying bastard!
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,How do you know?
Ann Perkins,I don't have any actual proof.
Leslie Knope,Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
Leslie Knope,"And if he is, he's a monster."
Leslie Knope,"And if he's not, you guys are great together."
Leslie Knope,"But if he is, I will kill him."
Ann Perkins,"Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last week, and he was very reassuring that we're headed in a good direction."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,But then he got distant.
Ann Perkins,"And when I asked to come visit him in Indianapolis, he was totally weird."
Ann Perkins,He was weird.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling."
Ann Perkins,But what if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,What if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,What if he has a girl up there?
Ann Perkins,I think he's cheating on me.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, luckily, I'm heading up there."
Leslie Knope,I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me."
Leslie Knope,"In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury."
Leslie Knope,But that was because of my haircut.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, champ."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, champion."
Tom Haverford,"Listen, you should come out tonight."
Tom Haverford,Club's gonna be dope.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not totally true."
Ben Wyatt,The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.
Ben Wyatt,Asked me if I wanted to watch.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You should probably get out of that.
Tom Haverford,I think she's gonna murder you.
Tom Haverford,Come on down to the Snakehole.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I'll stop by."
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you mind if I ask?"
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear tonight?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I was probably just gonna stick with this."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, seriously."
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear?
Ben Wyatt,Something totally different.
Ben Wyatt,Probably go home and grab something.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second largest rocking chair."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick two hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?"
Ron Swanson,I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.
Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth."
Ron Swanson,"When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth."
Leslie Knope,"I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight."
Ron Swanson,Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.
Leslie Knope,"No, we are picking him up."
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Chris Traeger,Welcome.
Chris Traeger,I am so glad you guys called.
Chris Traeger,This is gonna be great.
Chris Traeger,"Come on in, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Or we could just--
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Look at your foyer.
Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.
Chris Traeger,And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.
Chris Traeger,You cannot limit that.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.
Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.
Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.
Chris Traeger,Where do you live?
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here."
Chris Traeger,I like coats.
Leslie Knope,Could I use your bathroom really quick?
Chris Traeger,It's right behind you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Toilet seat's up.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, let me get a beer and a Pawnee Sunrise."
Extra,Do you wanna pay cash or start a tab?
Andy Dwyer,I It's okay I know Tom.
Extra,Tom who?
Andy Dwyer,Tom Hammen Hammenstein.
April Ludgate,Haverford.
Andy Dwyer,Haverford.
Andy Dwyer,"He's, like, my best friend."
Extra,"Hey, Freddy, this guy says he knows Tom and wants a drink for free."
Freddy,You got money to pay for those drinks?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Freddy,"Make room for the paying customers, huh?"
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Knope!"
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I think you might be right."
Leslie Knope,I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something."
Ann Perkins,I don't I'm coming up there.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"All right, okay."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,"They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.
Ron Swanson,I should have been here.
Ron Swanson,What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed?
Ron Swanson,Do you think they got eaten?
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill?
Leslie Knope,You sure you're not expecting company or something?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say, Ron?"
Chris Traeger,"Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub?"
Chris Traeger,It'll be just as good as it would've been here.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,That man is a legend.
Tom Haverford,Think about all the scents he's created.
Tom Haverford,"Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob."
Ben Wyatt,"Dennis Feinstein, though?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,So what's your plan?
Tom Haverford,"Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, "" Uh-oh."""
Tom Haverford,"""Looks like you just inhaled your future."""
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That might actually work.
April Ludgate,Is everything okay?
Andy Dwyer,"It kind of sucks that I'm super broke and I wanna buy you stuff and it's embarrassing that I can't, but I'm broke too, and I don't want anything."
April Ludgate,I just wanna hang out with you.
April Ludgate,"Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want."
Andy Dwyer,How?
April Ludgate,I'm a girl in a sleazy club.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Extra,Hey.
April Ludgate,I hate drinking alone.
Extra,Can I get you a drink?
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,Triple whiskey.
Extra,What's your name?
April Ludgate,Oprah.
Extra,I'm Kevin.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,I kind of wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,But I said I wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Here.
April Ludgate,You take this one.
April Ludgate,I will get myself a martini from that idiot.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, do you have any sisters?"
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Do you have sisters?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,So how's your mom?
Leslie Knope,Is she visiting?
Chris Traeger,"No, she's home up in Wisconsin."
Chris Traeger,Is your mom visiting?
Leslie Knope,Any aunts?
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,You have aunts?
Leslie Knope,Girl cousins?
Leslie Knope,"A youthful grandmother, perhaps?"
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Did you forget how to have a conversation?
Chris Traeger,I am so happy you guys are here.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna go fire up the grill.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kill him, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,Chris is cheating on Ann.
Leslie Knope,There's evidence everywhere.
Leslie Knope,She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Ron Swanson,Ask her to bring some garlic salt.
Ron Swanson,I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
April Ludgate,I got this from a waiter.
April Ludgate,I told him I had a pork deficiency.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet!
Andy Dwyer,Pigs in a blanket.
Andy Dwyer,I always wondered why they call them that.
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got.
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got from the bathroom.
Andy Dwyer,Mints.
Andy Dwyer,Six of 'em.
April Ludgate,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Okay, whoever gets the most free stuff by the end of the night wins."
Andy Dwyer,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,Go!
Chris Traeger,"Ron, would you like some salad?"
Ron Swanson,"Since I am not a rabbit, no, I do not."
Chris Traeger,Try it.
Chris Traeger,Salad's good for you.
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,Delicious.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, I exercise, and I exercise my mind."
Chris Traeger,And I try to keep up on current events.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's what you call it."
Chris Traeger,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Ann?
Leslie Knope,You know what's funny about Ann?
Leslie Knope,"She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, is that what's upsetting you?"
Chris Traeger,This is very uncomfortable for me.
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to say.
Tom Haverford,Watch the master work it.
Tom Haverford,I'm the Yoda of networking.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Yoda wouldn't actually need networking."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, his powers were more spiritual."
Tom Haverford,"Shut up, you nerd!"
Ben Wyatt,I get it.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Mr. Feinstein, Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,I'm the organizer of this soiree and I'm also a huge fan of yours.
Tom Haverford,I use all your colognes.
Tom Haverford,Sometimes two at once!
Dennis Feinstein,I don't recommend that.
Dennis Feinstein,Are you from the FDA?
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, legally, if you're from the FDA, you have to tell me."
Tom Haverford,I wanted to talk to you because I actually created my own scent.
Dennis Feinstein,Great.
Dennis Feinstein,"I'd love to smell it, right?"
Tom Haverford,I know you're a busy guy.
Dennis Feinstein,"Yeah, man."
Dennis Feinstein,I'm crazy busy.
Dennis Feinstein,"But all day long, people are pitching me colognes."
Dennis Feinstein,That guy just pitched me a cologne called Sluts.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
Dennis Feinstein,Not just anybody can do this.
Dennis Feinstein,"Although it's a great name, and I'm probably gonna steal it."
Tom Haverford,"Please, it'll take two seconds."
Tom Haverford,"If you like it, maybe we go into business together, branch out in other states, move over to watches and fancy raincoats, open up stores in London and Paris."
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I haven't thought it through.
Tom Haverford,"But for now, I want to present Tommy Fresh."
Dennis Feinstein,"All right, I get it."
Dennis Feinstein,It's a gag scent.
Dennis Feinstein,Hilarious!
Tom Haverford,"As in, ""It's hilarious how awesome it is""?"
Dennis Feinstein,It smells like somebody spilled Chinese food in a bird cage.
Dennis Feinstein,Horrible!
Dennis Feinstein,It's assaultive.
Dennis Feinstein,It takes everything in my power to not retch right now.
Dennis Feinstein,"Kid, you need to find another game."
Dennis Feinstein,Leave perfumery to the real men.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here."
Leslie Knope,"He's not worth it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron?"
Ron Swanson,What in the devil's name is this?
Chris Traeger,Portobello mushrooms.
Ron Swanson,Where's the steak?
Chris Traeger,There's no steak.
Chris Traeger,That's a healthier option.
Chris Traeger,It's organically grown.
Ron Swanson,Lord.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay."
Leslie Knope,Could you get us a cold compress or something?
April Ludgate,"Hey, six beers for table 12."
Extra,Do you work here?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,My dad owns this place.
April Ludgate,I'm Janet.
April Ludgate,Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,This round's on the house!
April Ludgate,All right!
April Ludgate,How about some tips?
Andy Dwyer,"Gum or mint, sir?"
Extra,Gum.
Extra,"Then a mint, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"All out, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't have those either, sir."
Extra,Do you have anything?
Andy Dwyer,"Out of everything, sir."
Andy Dwyer,This is so awesome!
Andy Dwyer,We are like Robin Hood.
Andy Dwyer,We steal from the club and we give to ourselves.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we'll find a 24 hour diner."
Leslie Knope,Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, what are you doing here?"
Ann Perkins,Whose pink razor's in your shower?
Chris Traeger,Excuse me?
Ann Perkins,Leslie found a pink razor and a pink swimming cap in your shower.
Ann Perkins,Whose is it?
Chris Traeger,I guess you're talking about my razor.
Chris Traeger,"I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better."
Chris Traeger,"For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone."
Ann Perkins,And the swimming cap?
Chris Traeger,"Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Triathlon, 2009."
Chris Traeger,Came in fourth!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet."
Leslie Knope,What's that about?
Chris Traeger,I'm a human being.
Chris Traeger,Sometimes I get blemishes.
Chris Traeger,I'm not perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"I am so sorry, honey."
Ann Perkins,I'm so embarrassed.
Ann Perkins,I was scared that you were cheating on me.
Chris Traeger,"No, I'm not cheating on you."
Chris Traeger,But I'm also not dating you.
Chris Traeger,We broke up last week.
Chris Traeger,We talked at your house.
Chris Traeger,Do you not remember this?
Ann Perkins,"Of course I remember, but we didn't break up."
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met."
Chris Traeger,Which you are.
Ann Perkins,"And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world... Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,You broke up with me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so here's what happened."
Leslie Knope,"Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of understandable.
Leslie Knope,Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you?"
Chris Traeger,"As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd."
Ann Perkins,And then I wanted you to meet my parents?
Chris Traeger,"I'm sure they're great people, but strange."
Ann Perkins,This is humiliating.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,I got you another melon-tini.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, that guy is a jerk, and if you ask me, he smells like--"
Tom Haverford,Success! He smells like success.
Tom Haverford,You know what I smell like? A teriyaki hairpiece?
Ben Wyatt,A teriyaki hairpiece?
Tom Haverford,I smell like the guy who's always coming up short.
Tom Haverford,And you know what? I'm just sick of it.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Fresh was my dream.
Tom Haverford,Now no one's ever gonna smell it but me.
Ben Wyatt,"I can smell your dreams, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,I can.
Ben Wyatt,And I can smell 'em from here.
Ben Wyatt,"And honestly, they smell terrible."
Ben Wyatt,But I like Tom.
April Ludgate,I've got a jar of olives.
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
April Ludgate,A thing of toothpicks that look like swords.
April Ludgate,And a year's supply of toilet paper.
Andy Dwyer,I got Boom! 38 dollars in tips.
April Ludgate,180 dollars.
Andy Dwyer,We should give it back.
April Ludgate,We should give it back.
Andy Dwyer,Follow me.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Bartender,Wow.
Bartender,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him."
Leslie Knope,There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
Leslie Knope,"And then the guy said he wasn't ""feeling it,"" so he left and I waited for an ambulance."
Leslie Knope,"One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again."
Leslie Knope,One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Leslie Knope,Skywriting isn't always positive.
Leslie Knope,"Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, ""Don't eat anything."""
Leslie Knope,"""Rebecca's coming."""
Leslie Knope,And then he broke up with me.
Ann Perkins,Who was Rebecca?
Leslie Knope,Yeah. Exactly.
Ann Perkins,Thanks for driving me.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, please."
Leslie Knope,It's just a goofy ceremony.
Leslie Knope,I don't even care about it.
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, Ron is staying behind."
Leslie Knope,He'll go.
Ann Perkins,Is Ron gonna be okay?
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know.
Ron Swanson,This isn't a steak.
Ron Swanson,Why would you call it that on your menu?
Extra,"I don't know what to tell you, man."
Ron Swanson,Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Ron Swanson,"Wait, wait."
Ron Swanson,"I worry what you just heard was, ""Give me a lot of bacon and eggs."""
Ron Swanson,"What I said was, ""Give me all the bacon and eggs you have."""
Ron Swanson,Do you understand?
Tom Haverford,It's called a Tommytini.
Tom Haverford,It's just vodka and a bunch of cinnamon.
Ben Wyatt,That sounds gross.
Donna Meagle,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Miller Lite."
Ben Wyatt,How'd you know?
Tom Haverford,Everybody knows.
Tom Haverford,That's your drink.
Donna Meagle,Tommy.
Tom Haverford,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's socializing!"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I'm having a good time."
Leslie Knope,Sit with us.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, like a week ago, right?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago."
Ben Wyatt,So that's why you tried to kiss him.
Ben Wyatt,We were all seriously confused about that.
Ann Perkins,"Who's ""we""? What are you-- Oh, God."
April Ludgate,Did you keep the toilet paper?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"I feel bad, but I need it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey, that's gotta be Feinstein's car."
Tom Haverford,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Give me Tommy Fresh.
Ben Wyatt,He's gonna smell your dreams now.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay? Is it that bad?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, it's unbelievable."
