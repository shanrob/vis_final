Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And on the first day, I went for a swim in the ocean."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And I got caught in a very strong current.
Ann Perkins,"You've heard this story before, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the drama."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The next thing I felt were two very powerful arms whisking me to safety.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And he looked down at me and he said, ""Are you okay?"""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And I looked up at him and I said, ""I am now."""

Tom Haverford,What's the difference?
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Justin,"Well, at least let me try and find him."
Justin,Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them?
Tom Haverford,I think Justin's right.
Tom Haverford,You should let him do this.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,"But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission."
Justin,Absolutely.
Tom Haverford,Absolutely.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, you're the best girlfriend ever."

Ann Perkins,I bought him some actual towels.
Ann Perkins,He was using a bathrobe.

Leslie Knope,"Troops, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Great news.
Leslie Knope,"The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00."
Tom Haverford,Are we talking a.m. or p.m.?
Tom Haverford,Those people are old.
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Justin's not here.
Leslie Knope,"It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors."
Leslie Knope,Some of them have been married for half a century.

Wendy,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it would be a good day to tell you that--"
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,Let me just stop you right there.
Wendy,"Look, Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends."
Tom Haverford,For now.
Tom Haverford,But think about how much better our friendship would be if we added doing it.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, I know our marriage was fake, but there's something between us."
Tom Haverford,"And I think we should give it a shot, for real."
Wendy,I just don't feel that way about you.
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"Each time I do, Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin, I've got you, Under my skin."
Andy Dwyer,"So, there's that one, I guess."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about these old fogy songs, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Why can't we just do our originals?
Andy Dwyer,"I just wrote a new song, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Bottom line, it's called Sex Hair."
Andy Dwyer,It's about how you can tell when someone's just had sex 'cause of how their hair gets matted up in the back.
Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Think of it this way.
Leslie Knope,"These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,You got a point.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do great.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, guys."
Kyle,"Andy, I've been here for half an hour."
Kyle,Can I get my shoes shined?
Andy Dwyer,"Kyle, I'm gonna lose my [bleep] on you if you ask me one more time."
Justin,Found him.
Justin,"Frank Beckerson, 63."
Justin,"Lives in a little town called Bridgeport, Illinois."
Justin,"Divorced, no kids, worked as a lifeguard when he was 20."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love."
Ron Swanson,You're asking my permission to take a nooner?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,Justin and I need to go on a romantically inspired road trip.
Ron Swanson,So it is a nooner?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure--"
Justin,"That's-- No, Leslie, that is not a nooner."
Justin,I tracked down this old flame of Leslie's mom.
Justin,We're gonna go pick him up.
Justin,We're gonna reunite them on Valentine's Day.
Justin,Is that a great story or what?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, great story indeed."
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your half day off.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Justin,Pick you up tomorrow around noon.
Leslie Knope,For our nooner.
Leslie Knope,Which is a cute word.
Ron Swanson,Explain it to her later.
Leslie Knope,Explain what?
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy Valentine's Day.
Mark Brendanawicz,"First off, a bear in a paper bag and a heartshaped balloon."
Ann Perkins,I love bears in bags.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you will like this, then."
Mark Brendanawicz,Because this is a giant teddy bear holding a red heart.
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Mark Brendanawicz,Festive.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's a dozen red roses in a heart-shaped arrangement.
Mark Brendanawicz,See that?
Mark Brendanawicz,Perfume.
Mark Brendanawicz,For the lady.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,"""Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein."""

Ann Perkins,Dennis.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, Dennis."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Finally, The Heart of the Ocean."
Ann Perkins,Gorgeous.
Mark Brendanawicz,I never had a chance to get a girl a cliched Valentine's Day gift before.
Mark Brendanawicz,So I got you all of them.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,That was very sweet.
Leslie Knope,Do you think they'll get married?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, what if they get married?"
Justin,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Would I call him ""Dad"" then?"
Justin,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, that'd be too much."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I'll call him ""Pappy."""
Leslie Knope,Pop?
Leslie Knope,Poppy?
Leslie Knope,PawPaw?
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I'm getting ahead of myself.
Justin,Hey.
Justin,You never know.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call him ""PooPaw."""
Leslie Knope,How often do you get to reunite soul mates?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?
Leslie Knope,Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jen."
Leslie Knope,I really want you to be happy.
Leslie Knope,Stay away from John Mayer.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I've known him my whole life.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Frank Beckerson,My God.
Frank Beckerson,Marlene.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,PooPaw.
Leslie Knope,"PooPaw, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not Marlene.
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,So sorry.
Frank Beckerson,I should really wear my glasses.
Frank Beckerson,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Frank, I was wondering."
Leslie Knope,My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Leslie Knope,Did that work out?
Frank Beckerson,No.
Frank Beckerson,Never did.
Frank Beckerson,Though I did once act as my own lawyer.
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,I found some old pictures of Marlene and me.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Look how young she is.
Justin,These are amazing.
Frank Beckerson,Probably shouldn't show you this one.
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Frank Beckerson,Your mom was such a firecracker.
Frank Beckerson,"Smart, funny, sharp as a tack."
Frank Beckerson,Such firm breasts.
Frank Beckerson,"Oh, that was inappropriate."
Frank Beckerson,Wow.
Frank Beckerson,"I am just, all of a sudden, so nervous to see her again."
Frank Beckerson,I'm gonna throw up real quick and then we can leave.
Derek,Hi.
April Ludgate,Hi.
Derek,Valentine's bash at The Bulge tonight.
Derek,We can get you a drink bracelet.
April Ludgate,I can't.
April Ludgate,I've gotta work at the Senior Center Valentine's Day Dance thing.
Ben,That sounds amazing.
Ben,Can we come?
April Ludgate,I guess.
April Ludgate,I don't know why you would want to.
Derek,Because old people are funny.
Ben,"Yeah, it'll be like The Golden Girls."
Derek,I have to go get ready.
Leslie Knope,"So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?"
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,"You know, here and there."
Frank Beckerson,You know?
Frank Beckerson,"Grenada, for a while."
Frank Beckerson,"Then Panama, then Afghanistan."
Leslie Knope,So you were in the military?
Frank Beckerson,Nope.
Frank Beckerson,"You know, I always wonder how different my life would've been if your mother had married me."
Frank Beckerson,It would've been better.
Frank Beckerson,I'll tell you that much.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Frank Beckerson,I'm fine.
Frank Beckerson,I'm good.
Frank Beckerson,I am just so nervous to see her.
Frank Beckerson,There is nothing to be nervous about.
Frank Beckerson,Have you got a bag or something?
Leslie Knope,A what?
Justin,Do you have a bag?
Leslie Knope,I have a purse.
Justin,"Well, give him the purse then."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"You like potato and I like potahto, You like tomato and I like tomahto, Potato, potahto, Tomato, tomahto."
Andy Dwyer,Let's call the whole thing off.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh I mean, that sucked, didn't it?"
Burly,Maybe if you sang it like Louis Armstrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, here's the thing, though."
Andy Dwyer,Who is that?
Andy Dwyer,My problem is I don't know how to tell if we're doing good.
Andy Dwyer,"Because when you play a rock show, it's really easy to know if you're doing great because chicks will flash their boobs at you when you're up onstage."
Andy Dwyer,"And you're like, ""Oh!"""
Andy Dwyer,"""That must've sounded pretty good."""
Andy Dwyer,"If that happens here, my eyes will fall out of my head and I'll die."
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Justin,Maybe we should--
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Justin,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Justin,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Andy Dwyer,"But I can't see anybody but you, Flip flop."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I might be crazy, but I have this weird suspicion that things are going well with us."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I have that same suspicion."
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you know, having never been in something like this before, I feel the need to ask, how am I doing?"
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, I'm sort of serious."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, fine, forget it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm just saying, you know, it seems to me, on paper, that this thing we have is pretty great."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, nerd."
Ann Perkins,"On paper, this thing we have is pretty great."
Ann Perkins,Mark is a great boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,I have no complaints at all.
Ann Perkins,Everything is good.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't feel right about this.
Justin,Are you kidding me?
Justin,This is so much fun.
Justin,"Look, we took a road trip today."
Justin,We chased your mom's long lost love down a freeway.
Leslie Knope,"He's a loon, Justin."
Justin,So he freaked out a little bit.
Justin,He got nervous.
Justin,"I mean, you would, too."
Justin,He was fine by the time we got him back inside the car.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know why you're pushing."
Leslie Knope,Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?
Leslie Knope,How would that help her?
Leslie Knope,I don't like this.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is gonna work.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling this off.
Justin,Come on.
Justin,"No, no, no."
Justin,"Look, we're here."
Justin,Let's just see what happens.
Leslie Knope,"What happens is, I drive him home."
Justin,"Now, look."
Justin,You need to breathe.
Leslie Knope,I'm breathing.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Mom.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,There you are.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what's the big surprise?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You gonna try to check me into an old folks home?
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,"One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Frank.
Frank Beckerson,"Hello, Marlene."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,My gosh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I can't believe it's really you.
Frank Beckerson,Wanna catch up?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Justin,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Do you think we should stand by--
Justin,She's fine.
Justin,Let's just let this unfold.
Derek,"Come here, sonny."
Derek,Let me tell you about the Civil War.
Ben,"Grandpa, leave me alone."
Ben,You smell like death.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna get some punch.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,You guys are really adorable.
April Ludgate,It's really nice.
Justin,"So Leslie's like, ""That's it, I'm taking him home."""
Justin,"So, we look over, and he's not even in the car anymore."
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.
Justin,No.
Justin,It's insane.
Ron Swanson,What does Leslie think about all this?
Justin,"Oh, God, Leslie."
Justin,I don't even know.
Justin,I think I just lost track of her in all the chaos.
Justin,"Anyway, so, now he and Marlene are off somewhere, doing God knows what."
Justin,I don't wanna--
Wendy,You're suing me for alimony?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"When we were married, I got accustomed to a certain lifestyle."
Tom Haverford,And I'm entitled to money to maintain that lifestyle.
Wendy,This is insane.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got."
Tom Haverford,And you can make it all go away if you just gave me a chance.
Wendy,What?
Tom Haverford,Three dates.
Tom Haverford,One date.
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Wendy,"So your plan was to sue me, and then to use that to blackmail me into falling in love with you."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You guys sound good.
Andy Dwyer,You really think so?
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to tell.
Andy Dwyer,It's like Bizarro Land out there.
Andy Dwyer,"As soon as we finish a song, it's dead silence."
Ann Perkins,"Well, what do you expect, you know."
Ann Perkins,They're like a million years old.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm glad you like it."
Andy Dwyer,You were always a big supporter of the band.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Break's over.
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, cracking the whip."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, these old bags paid for some entertainment."
April Ludgate,So get up there.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you should play that song The Way You Look Tonight."
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
April Ludgate,It's a good one.
Andy Dwyer,The next one's going out to a special little lady named April Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,"Someday, when I'm all aloneâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Are you guysâ¦
Ann Perkins,Never mind.
April Ludgate,Why do you care?
Ann Perkins,I don't.
Andy Dwyer,"Just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,What about you? What do you do for a living?
Frank Beckerson,"Well, it's been an interesting ride."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Yeah?
Frank Beckerson,I got a job at a grocery store right out of college just for a way to make money.
Frank Beckerson,"And here I am, 40 years later, completely unemployed."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Wow.
Frank Beckerson,What do you say we pick up where we left off?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"You're not serious, right?"
Frank Beckerson,I'm serious as a heart attack.
Frank Beckerson,Of which I've had four.
Andy Dwyer,"And the world is cold, I will feel a glow, Just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mom, are you okay? Did Frank leave?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He just stepped away for a second.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we brought him here.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, it's okay."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"It was very thoughtful, sweetheart."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's not your fault that he turned out to be--
Frank Beckerson,Excuse me.
Frank Beckerson,Hi.
Frank Beckerson,"Excuse me, hi."
Frank Beckerson,My name is Frank Beckerson.
Frank Beckerson,"Marlene, you blew it."
Frank Beckerson,"Take one last look, Marlene, because you'll never see this body again."
Justin,"Marlene, what happened between you two? Tell me everything."
Justin,I want every detail.
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're almost done, so we can leave soon."
Derek,Yes.
Derek,"I'll take you for an ice cream malted, and then we can go choose our caskets."
April Ludgate,"God, why does everything we do have to be cloaked in, like, 15 layers of irony?"
Derek,Here's something un-ironic.
Derek,"Ever since you've been hanging out with that meathead, you've become completely lame."
April Ludgate,You know what? We're breaking up.
Derek,"Fine, then you can't make out with me when you're drunk anymore."
April Ludgate,"Fine, then I'll make out with Ben."
Ben,Pass.
Derek,"No, he's my boyfriend."
Derek,You can either make out with both of us or none of us.
April Ludgate,"Fine, none of you."
Ben,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"I've got you, Under my skin"
Ron Swanson,"Everything okay, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like."
Leslie Knope,But he acted like a real jerk today.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,There's something about the way he treats people or something.
Ron Swanson,He's a tourist.
Ron Swanson,"He vacations in people's lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook, and moves on."
Ron Swanson,All he's interested in are stories.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Ron Swanson,"Basically, Leslie, he's selfish."
Ron Swanson,And you're not.
Ron Swanson,And that's why you don't like him.
Extra,I told you so.
Extra,It's Duke Silver.
Extra,"Duke, can I have your autograph? I love your music."
Ron Swanson,"You're mistaken, ladies."
Ron Swanson,Move along.
Andy Dwyer,I got you under my skin
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Go Mouse Rat.
Extra,I thought you were just terrific.
Andy Dwyer,Seriously?
Extra,You sound like Dean Martin.
Extra,If I were 50 years younger
Andy Dwyer,What? Wait.
Andy Dwyer,"Who's Dean Martin? If I'm not mistaken, that was the old lady version of flashing."
Andy Dwyer,Nailed the gig.
Justin,"Look, it's sad, I know."
Justin,But we'll still be friends.
Justin,We're gonna see each other all the time.
Justin,"I come into town, like, every other weekend."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,You guys can't break up.
Tom Haverford,We can fix this.
Tom Haverford,Let me talk to Leslie.
Justin,"Tom, it's over."
Justin,She doesn't wanna see me anymore.
Tom Haverford,Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong?
Justin,No.
Justin,"Seriously, this has nothing to do with you."
Tom Haverford,Can we still go suit shopping?
Justin,Of course.
Justin,Armani's having a sale right now.
Justin,I'm gonna get you a pocket square.
Tom Haverford,All right.
