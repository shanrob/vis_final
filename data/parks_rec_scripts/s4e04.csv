Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Wildeness weekend is upon us.
Ron Swanson,There will be no video games.
Ron Swanson,There will be no Internet pads.
Ron Swanson,This weekend you have two parents: Me and Mother Nature.
Andy Dwyer,And I am Mother Nature's brother: Brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,But you can call me Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Or brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,Your call.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Brother nature.
Ron Swanson,For the last three years I have served as troop leader of the Pawnee Rangers.
Ron Swanson,This is our handbook.
Ron Swanson,I wrote the whole thing myself.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time to give out the badges."
Leslie Knope,"Um, let's see."
Leslie Knope,"Emily, you get the badge for most community service."
Leslie Knope,"To Casey, the best penguin blog badge."
Leslie Knope,"To Abigail, flyest hairstyle."
Leslie Knope,And Ann gets the badge for second flyest hairstyle.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,I wasn't competing for that.
Leslie Knope,I'll say.
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, a plucky fifthgrader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say."
Leslie Knope,"""No."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is males only."""
Leslie Knope,"""Go start your own club."""
Leslie Knope,She couldn't.
Leslie Knope,So I did.
Leslie Knope,"We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freaking awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine?"
Leslie Knope,The answer is mine.
Leslie Knope,Say mine is better.
Ron Swanson,It's not a competition.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, but it is."
Leslie Knope,Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my stars."
Leslie Knope,I'm just a little lady.
Leslie Knope,My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
Ron Swanson,"I have no problem with strong women, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Who's Leslie?
Leslie Knope,"My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my haired."
Ron Swanson,"However, the Pawnee Rangers were founded because some boys want to go out into nature and learn traditional survival skills without being distracted by girls."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers."
Leslie Knope,"Say my club is better, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,My club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say my club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Give it up.
Leslie Knope,Whose club is better?
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,You know it.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Ron Swanson,"On principle, I never say anything that another person is obviously trying to get me to say."
Ron Swanson,"My first wedding ceremony took two hours, because after the priest said ""Repeat after me"" I fell silent."
Ben Wyatt,"I've been auditing the budget, and I noticed you're way behind on your paperwork."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Jerry, you haven't filled out a PC10 form in two and a half years."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez, I'm sorry."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we kinda do our paperwork at our own speed."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I kinda need you to do it at my speed."
Donna Meagle,"Fine, I'll do them."
Donna Meagle,What is wrong with you today?
Donna Meagle,Did they cancel Game of Thrones?
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing is wrong, just do your job."
Ben Wyatt,And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.
Ben Wyatt,It's a crossover hit.
Ben Wyatt,It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts.
Ben Wyatt,They're telling human stories in a fantasy world.
Ben Wyatt,"Fill out the forms, please."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I used to have one really good reason for staying in Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,"But now, I'm not sure what's keeping me here."
Ben Wyatt,"Although, I am just two sandwiches away from a free meatball sub."
Ben Wyatt,This is expired.
Ron Swanson,"Rangers, as a reward for coming on this trip, I have gotten you each two gifts."
Ron Swanson,Go ahead.
Ron Swanson,Open 'em.
Darren,What is this?
Ron Swanson,"That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man."
Ron Swanson,"It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make ""art."""
Extra,What's the second gift?
Ron Swanson,The second gift is the box itself.
Ron Swanson,You have 10 minutes to assemble a shelter using only your two gifts.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Leslie Knope,Ladies!
Leslie Knope,The goddess cabin has never looked better.
Leslie Knope,This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time?"
Leslie Knope,Lauren?
Lauren,"I made a ""Gertrude Stein."""
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Lauren, that's so good!"
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Um I was making some cornhusk dolls for everyone but they kinda turned out wrong so they look like monsters.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna put that over there.
Ann Perkins,In the fire.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ann's keeping us warm."
Leslie Knope,And that's important.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,What was your craft?
April Ludgate,I drew something on my arm.
April Ludgate,It's a pioneer girl watching her grandmother get trampled by a buffalo.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,This right here's all the blood coming out her face.
DJ Bluntz,"DJ Bluntz is in the building, here to announce that Tom Haverford is in the building."

Donna Meagle,I got a question.
Tom Haverford,Mmhmm?
Donna Meagle,What do you think about inviting Ben to come along with us today?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Noo!
Tom Haverford,This is our thing.
Donna Meagle,But he really seems like he could use a day off.
Donna Meagle,He's like a skinny little rubber band that's about to snap in half.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,He doesn't know how to relax.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and I are relaxation professionals."
Tom Haverford,There's no way Ben can slow down enough to keep up with us.
Tom Haverford,"My Nubian princess, this is our holy day."
Tom Haverford,It's the one day a year I allow myself to be selfish.
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, cupcakes."
Tom Haverford,"Those are all for me, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla."
Leslie Knope,This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
Leslie Knope,I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm trying to teach my boys about rationing food, and your selfindulgent ethnic food court isn't helping."
Leslie Knope,"Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to ""Party in the USA"" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'moresoff."
Darren,"So what's on our schedule, Mr. Swanson?"
Ron Swanson,We have one activity planned: Not getting killed.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, everybody must be at Rangers weekend."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I actually was a ranger for 12 years"
Chris Traeger,That's wonderful.
Chris Traeger,Maybe you should take the day off.
Chris Traeger,"You know, rest is very important."
Chris Traeger,Did you know that lab rats who are deprived of rest grow tumors all over their bodies?
Chris Traeger,You should Google it.
Chris Traeger,It's horrifying.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, thank you."
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go have lunch with my daughter!"
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, if you wanted, you know, you should join us for lunch."
Jerry Gergich,"My daughter, she's really sweet."
Chris Traeger,"I would love to, Jerry, but I'm afraid that I am busy."
Chris Traeger,I have got to run.
Chris Traeger,Google those rat tumors!
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself 2011.
Tom Haverford,Treat yourself 2011.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, lord."
Donna Meagle,Is he eating soup?
Donna Meagle,On a bench?

Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,"Great pillow fight, girls."
Leslie Knope,That was one of our best ones yet.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Now it's time for awards.
Leslie Knope,Lulu gets the golden pillow.
Leslie Knope,And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, what is it?"
Darren,"Ms. Knope, I don't like the Rangers anymore."
Darren,I want to become a Pawnee Goddess.
Leslie Knope,I did it!
Leslie Knope,My club is officially the best club.
Leslie Knope,"I would give myself a merit badge that says ""Best Club Founder,"" but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself ""Prettiest eyes"" as a placeholder."
Leslie Knope,"I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great."
Ron Swanson,You were defecting?
Darren,"I like you, Mr. Swanson, it's just All we do is sit in silence and eat beans."
Ron Swanson,Those beans were a reward.
Leslie Knope,"Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you should start your own club, for boys."
Ron Swanson,Get back to your canvas box.
Ron Swanson,We'll discuss this no further.
Ron Swanson,And I'll thank you to keep the ruckus down so my boys can focus on solitude.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Darren."
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"So, treat yourself day is just a day where you go to the spa and then the mall?"
Tom Haverford,I knew you wouldn't get it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm a relaxation novice."
Ben Wyatt,Give me some guidance.
Tom Haverford,"Listen to me, Bento box, the point of this is to pamper yourself."
Tom Haverford,"Just relax, man."
Ben Wyatt,I can't.
Ben Wyatt,Something about the sound of harps that makes me nervous.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Hi, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,Relaxation lesson number one: Acupuncture.
Donna Meagle,"It's great for your back, and your rear."

Jerry Gergich,"So, anyway, we were gonna go to lunch, so"
Chris Traeger,I retroactively accept your original offer.
Chris Traeger,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away."
Extra,"Ms. Knope, wasn't Darren just asking for the same equality that you and the goddesses wanted five years ago?"
Leslie Knope,"In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than"
Extra,Wasn't your answer the very same thing that the ranger council said to you?
Extra,"""Stick to your own kind""?"
Ann Perkins,Who wants homemade peanut brittle?
Extra,"Ms. Perkins, please, we're in the middle of a debate."
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, goddesses."
Leslie Knope,We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
Lauren,I disagree.
Lauren,What about a public forum?
Lauren,You always say that there's no better solution for a hotbutton issue than a good old fashioned public forum.
Leslie Knope,"Great idea, Lauren."
Lauren,What was that?
Leslie Knope,"I said, ""great idea, Lauren."""
Leslie Knope,I've taught them too well.
Leslie Knope,I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud.

Leslie Knope,But mostly proud.
Leslie Knope,70 30.

Millicent Gergich,"You know, last summer I did a 50 mile bike ride for the red cross."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, she did."
Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, biking for charity is literally one of my interests on Facebook."
Chris Traeger,I can't believe how alike we are.
Millicent Gergich,"I know, it's like we're literally the same person."
Chris Traeger,We are having a moment.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to wonder weekend's firstever public forum.

Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's open up the floor to debate.
Leslie Knope,"Who yes, Abigail."

Abigail,Separate but equal is never really equal.
Abigail,We should let the boys in.
Leslie Knope,"Mmm, interesting."
Leslie Knope,Casey?
Casey,I disagree.
Casey,I think there's a benefit to educating the genders separately.
Leslie Knope,I see where you're coming from.
Leslie Knope,Let's hear from a ranger.
Leslie Knope,Anyone?
Leslie Knope,Darren?
Darren,It's cold and dirty out here.
Darren,And you guys have candy.

Leslie Knope,We have amazing candy in there.
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to Nirvana, the Plaza at Eagleton."
Tom Haverford,"There's a reflecting pool out back, there's an oldtimey train that runs through the mall, and three Burberrys."

Chris Traeger,But you are her father.
Chris Traeger,And that is a sacred thing.
Chris Traeger,"I would like to spend the next 2 to 4 days with you so you can get to know me better, to find out if I'm the kind of person who's good enough for your daughter."
Chris Traeger,"Then, you can come with us on our first 3 to 6 dates"

Jerry Gergich,And I trust you.

Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no."
Tom Haverford,"I mean that in a good way, Ben."

Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Can I sit down? Look, I didn't mean for this to happen."
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of respect for the Pawnee Rangers, even if they were jerks five years ago."
Leslie Knope,You're not a jerk.
Leslie Knope,You're a good troop leader.
Ron Swanson,Not for these times I'm not.
Ron Swanson,"It's taken me a while to see this, but these kids I don't understand 'em."
Ron Swanson,And they certainly don't understand me.
Leslie Knope,That's not true.
Ron Swanson,"No, it is."
Ron Swanson,And it's okay.
Ron Swanson,People change.
Ron Swanson,Their interests change.
Ron Swanson,It's the way of the world.
Ron Swanson,When did kids get so interested in fun? Ah I'm gonna turn in.
Ron Swanson,"You were right, by the way."
Ron Swanson,Your group is better.
Donna Meagle,What's wrong? Out with it.
Ben Wyatt,"I was seeing a woman, uh, for a while, and then we stopped seeing each other."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, pretty recently."
Donna Meagle,That's why you've been off your game.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, dog."
Donna Meagle,"You're a catch, Wyatt."
Donna Meagle,You're gonna be okay.
Tom Haverford,"There's chickenheads everywhere, Ben."
Tom Haverford,Chickenheads all around this mall.
Tom Haverford,"You're gonna find one, and you're gonna be great."
Tom Haverford,"But, for now, why don't you let it out? Treat yourself to a good cry."
Tom Haverford,"One question, though."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Tom Haverford,Why so serious?
Ann Perkins,"Wait, I got something."
Darren,Oh! Cool! Awesome! Nice!
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, D-money."
Darren,What kind of bait did you use?
Ann Perkins,I bought this mackerel at the supermarket.
Ann Perkins,I've been standing in the water with the fish on my hook for 30 minutes.
Ann Perkins,I saw it on an episode I Love Lucy.
Ann Perkins,Pathetic? Maybe.
Ann Perkins,"But, feels pretty good to have a bunch of little boys be super into me."
Ann Perkins,That came out wrong.
Leslie Knope,Ron! Come fish with us!
Ron Swanson,That's okay.
Ron Swanson,Seems like you have things under control.
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Come do that thing where you catch one with your hands! I've seen him do it, it's incredible."

Chris Traeger,"Again, the date was amazing, we had sparkling conversation, and, full disclosure, she did spend the night at my house."
Chris Traeger,"Have a great day, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Lauren,We're here for the club.
Ron Swanson,That was last week.
Lauren,The ad says today.
Ron Swanson,Ad?
Leslie Knope,Are you tough as nails? Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles than a mattress?
Leslie Knope,"Do you find video games pointless and shopping malls stupid? Do you march to the beat of your own drummer? Did you make the drum yourself? If so, you might just have what it takes to be a Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's most hardcore outdoor club starts today.
