Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nonconflict diamond.
April Ludgate,"When Andy proposed to me, he gave me a ring pop, but then he ate it first."
April Ludgate,How did Ben do it?
Leslie Knope,Let me start from the beginning.
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Leslie Knope,"In 1832, Ben's great great great great grandfather, Teodore Wyatt, a bastard, met a beautiful seamstress from Antwerp."

Ben Wyatt,We've gotten several noise complaints.
Leslie Knope,We're getting married!
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Chris Traeger,"Mm, the joy that I am feeling right now is profound and unmatched in the modern era."
Chris Traeger,And I can't tell you what it means to me that I'm the very first person that you chose to tell.
Leslie Knope,Oh
Chris Traeger,"Let me walk around with you as you tell everyone else so that I can share true joy being spread, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,We have something very exciting to tell you that you have never heard before.

Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tminus six hours until the engagement party."
Leslie Knope,Has you know who responded yet?
Ann Perkins,"Surprisingly, no, Larry Bird has not RSVP'd yet."
Leslie Knope,"Well, he kind of waits until the last minute."
Leslie Knope,That's his style.
Leslie Knope,"Put him down as a ""maybe."""
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, totally."
Ben Wyatt,I just have two small requests.
Ben Wyatt,"One, put Twizzlers on the candy table, and two, cancel the party because you invited my parents, and they can't be in the same room together."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Great, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"No to canceling the party, and no to Twizzlers."
Leslie Knope,We are a Red Vines family.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have to get used to that.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're scared, but I love you, and this party is gonna go great."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if there's anyone who can bring my parents together, it's no one."
Ben Wyatt,No one can ever bring them together.
Ben Wyatt,My family situation is complicated.
Ben Wyatt,My parents got divorced and they hate each other.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I guess it's not that complicated."
Tom Haverford,Okay!

Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
April Ludgate,Please.
Tom Haverford,"There's actually a lot more, but tell us your thoughts so far."
Andy Dwyer,It's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Tom Haverford,Yes!
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,It's terrible.
Andy Dwyer,"It's terrible, you guys."
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, baby."
Andy Dwyer,You're so smart.
April Ludgate,You're presenting this to Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,"Don't talk about any of your old, failed businesses, get rid of that stupid light show, and definitely don't use any weird, madeup words that Ron doesn't understand."
Tom Haverford,But the presentation's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
Tom Haverford,We don't have time to start from scratch.
April Ludgate,"Well, if you do any of that, he's not gonna invest, so"
April Ludgate,Your funeral.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,Let's go over the plan.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you and I go stargazing in Harvey James park, while my parents slowly strangle each other in the living room."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Your mom arrives at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,"We hand her a glass of chilled white wine, and, oh, look, my mom is walking over, and they're both educators and mothers."
Leslie Knope,What a fabulous coincidence.
Leslie Knope,"Then later, Stephen Wyatt shows up that's your dad."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,He's terrifying.
Leslie Knope,"We make some small talk, and 30 minutes later, I show everybody the big surprise."
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are weaving our lives together, so I have woven this quilt."
Leslie Knope,It represents every member of our new united family.
Leslie Knope,"Of all my metaphorical art projects, this is by far the coziest."
Ben Wyatt,This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I worked really hard on it.
Leslie Knope,"And, out of respect, I did not include any images of the only other man in the world who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, you did, right there."
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's just a little one."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, this quilt is going to unite the Wyatt clan."
Ben Wyatt,"It's beautiful, and it won't."
Ann Perkins,"Everyone, before everyone else gets here, I'd like to make a little toast."
Ann Perkins,My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.
Ann Perkins,"And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it."
Ann Perkins,"Ben, don't you dare hurt her."
Ben Wyatt,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,Don't laugh.
Andy Dwyer,She means it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I won't."
Ron Swanson,"Seriously, son, don't hurt her."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm not planning on hurting her."
Jerry Gergich,You better not be.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not!
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Ben, you best watch yourself."
Ben Wyatt,Why would any of you think I would hurt Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,You're all my friends too.
April Ludgate,Nah.
Chris Traeger,This was literally the most beautiful and moving thing that I have ever heard.
Donna Meagle,"There, there, baby boy."
Donna Meagle,Take all the time you need.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, in a wrestling match, Kirk would win."
Ben Wyatt,"But overall, who would you rather have at the helm of your Sovereign class starship?"
Ben Wyatt,JeanLuc Picard.
Ben Wyatt,No contest.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, your mom's here."
Leslie Knope,I need you.
Donna Meagle,Thank God.
Julia Wyatt,There's my boy!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Mom."
Ben Wyatt,Nice to see you.
Ben Wyatt,"This is Leslie Knope, my fiancee."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"It'sit's really nice to finally meet you, Ms."
Leslie Knope,Wyatt.
Julia Wyatt,Oh!
Julia Wyatt,Please call me Julia.
Julia Wyatt,Is your father here yet?
Ben Wyatt,"No fighting tonight, Mom."
Julia Wyatt,Don't worry!
Julia Wyatt,"I'm going to be civil, as long as he is."
Julia Wyatt,"Frankly, after what he did at Geoffrey's graduation"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have some white wine for you, some Chardonnay."
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,Right this way.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you guys, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,Ann.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"You all right, man?"
Chris Traeger,"The toast that you gave to Ben and Leslie was so beautiful, and I'm feeling very raw from my therapy."
Chris Traeger,I am so happy And so sad.
Chris Traeger,It's like a perfect storm of emotions.
Chris Traeger,"And so I'm hiding out here, so I don't ruin this party for my two amazing best friends who I love so much."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,There's no more tissue.
Chris Traeger,Everything ends!
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, there's more tissue."
Ann Perkins,There's
Chris Traeger,Everything goes away.
Leslie Knope,"And I said, rules or no rules, I just have to kiss that beautiful face."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, that's a Knope woman for you."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"When we see something adorable, we attack it."
Julia Wyatt,"He is adorable, isn't he?"
Julia Wyatt,"You chose well, Benny."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"So far, so good."
Ben Wyatt,I'll admit it.
Ben Wyatt,Things are going surprisingly well.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,And pack it up.
Ben Wyatt,"It's over, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,He brought his girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben."
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, Ben!"
Julia Wyatt,Your father brought his little plaything.
Steve Wyatt,"Hiya, Benny."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Dad, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Unh.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ulani."
Ben Wyatt,Thought you weren't coming.
Steve Wyatt,"Ulani is my girlfriend, and she's important to me, and I need her here."
Leslie Knope,"Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie."
Leslie Knope,What a wonderful surprise.
Leslie Knope,We're so happy that you're here.
Ulani,"What the hell, Steve?"
Ulani,They didn't know I was coming?
Julia Wyatt,We didn't know it was spring break.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming."
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry you all have to go home.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Red Vines anyone?"
Steve Wyatt,We're a Twizzlers family.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we will."
Ben Wyatt,I called a cab.
Ben Wyatt,It's outside.
Ben Wyatt,"I gave the driver 100 bucks to sit and wait, so whenever we're ready to go like, maybe right now all we have to do is walk outside."
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents."
Leslie Knope,Help me make this work.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk about the stuff they care about.
Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing, skiing, sailing, and after a few drinks, put on a Prince album."
Ben Wyatt,Don't mention the Green Bay Packers or the state of Iowa.
Ben Wyatt,"And also, I have enough frequent flyer miles to get us to Australia tonight."
Ann Perkins,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, slight speed bump."
Leslie Knope,"Everything is terrible, but I am going to fix it with my secret weapon."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well I will make sure that everything else runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you are such a good friend."
Leslie Knope,"You are a beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk ox."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ox, for keeping this ship afloat."
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Ann Perkins,"Guys, I need your help, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Chris is in the back room, and he's crying."
Ann Perkins,"Go in there, calm him down, make him feel better."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie and Ben have enough to deal with, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris crying?"
Ann Perkins,"Uh, he's emotional."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris emotional?"
Ann Perkins,"Because he's in therapy right now, and it's dredging up a lot of stuff for him."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, wait, like what kind of stuff?"
Ann Perkins,"Like, I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone."
Andy Dwyer,Why isn't he dating anyone?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, why don't you date him?"
Ann Perkins,"Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I'mI'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?"
April Ludgate,Self centered much?
Ann Perkins,"Just go, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,Ron in 60 seconds.
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,I haven't seen you tonight.
Tom Haverford,I've been working on my presentation.
Tom Haverford,"I just came by to congratulate Leslie, and then I'm heading back."
Ron Swanson,I admire the work ethic.
Ron Swanson,I'm always looking for new investments.
Ron Swanson,"Ever since I got my first job at the age of nine, I have put all my money into gold, which is currently at an all time high."
Ron Swanson,So I have a certain amount of money.
Ron Swanson,I've said too much.
Ron Swanson,Looking forward to tomorrow.
Tom Haverford,Yes About that.
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering, is there any chance we could reschedule?"
Tom Haverford,"I just want to make sure everything is up to my worldclass ""standees."""
Ron Swanson,"I like to keep my appointments, son, and I like others to do the same."
Tom Haverford,"Of course, yes."
Tom Haverford,"No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow."
Tom Haverford,I think you're gonna be very impressed with our presentation.
Ron Swanson,"""Our presentation""?"
Ron Swanson,Who else is joining you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ricka ricka ricka ricka!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Swanson.
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's me.
Ron Swanson,I didn't realize you were a part of this.
Tom Haverford,Of course he is.
Tom Haverford,He's my business partner.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Clean!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Business partner, now and forever."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Forever 21.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,21 gun salute.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Salute your shorts.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Kaboosh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I just free associated all over the ""moussetache."""
Tom Haverford,That's just one of many skills he brings to this business partnership.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are those, shrimp?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ah!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Rethink that move, son."
Ulani,Let's just drive back.
Ulani,I feel weird.
Leslie Knope,"Steve, you like sailing, right?"
Steve Wyatt,"Not any more, since Julia got the boat in the divorce and then sold it to a scrapyard because she's terrible."
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Yech, no thankee."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about something other than sailing.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you head in the other room?
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise that there she goes.
Leslie Knope,"There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in."
Steve Wyatt,I don't like surprises.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, you gave it a try, but this quilt thing is not going to work."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences."
Leslie Knope,"In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna Jerry parking lot feud of 2006."
Ben Wyatt,What was the third time?
Leslie Knope,Right [Bleep] now.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I still don't think it's gonna work, but I am really attracted to you right now."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Police, open up!"
Andy Dwyer,We have a warrant!
Andy Dwyer,"Just kidding, it's us."
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, we got you!"
Chris Traeger,Andy and April.
April Ludgate,We have someone who wants to see you!
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,Come here.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, big boy."
Chris Traeger,"You are such a brave, good dog, with so much spirit."
Chris Traeger,You've overcome so much.
Chris Traeger,You are the most wonderful dog in the whole world.
Chris Traeger,And I am so happy for you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you."
Leslie Knope,Voila!
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt!
Leslie Knope,"It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, this is lovely."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Ulani,Where's my square?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're not technically"
Steve Wyatt,Not technically what?
Julia Wyatt,Not technically an adult.
Steve Wyatt,"This is a very thoughtless omission, Leslie, and as far as I'm concerned, if there's no Ulani square, this is not a legitimate unity quilt."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that old Chestnut."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I will make an Ulani square.
Leslie Knope,"Very, very easy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is your square now."
Leslie Knope,"What does ""Ulani"" mean?"
Ulani,"""Cheerful."""
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,Unity!
Leslie Knope,It's that simple.
Leslie Knope,All we had to do was
Julia Wyatt,I don't want her name on my quilt.
Leslie Knope,It's not your it's everyone's quilt.
Leslie Knope,It's a unity quilt.
Ulani,I think it's mean that you didn't do a square for me.
Steve Wyatt,It's a disaster is what it is.
Julia Wyatt,"You can say that again, Steve."
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben, they're agreeing."
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm thinking we junk everything except the mannequins."
Tom Haverford,Ron's gotta see how dope the outfits are.
Tom Haverford,That's the business.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we going to Ron?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ron should be coming to us!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We created Entertainment 720.
Tom Haverford,Which was a huge failure.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I don't know
Tom Haverford,"Look, a bank's not gonna give us a loan, and Ron loves my entrepreneurial spirit."
Tom Haverford,"Trust me, he's our best chance at getting startup money."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I hear that.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let's go clubbing.
Tom Haverford,"No, we gotta work."
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear me say we gotta junk most of the presentation?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy, I will always be there for you, no matter what, but right now, I cannot be there for you because I have to go."
Tom Haverford,"I hate to say this, but Sometimes you've gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That was beautiful.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That changed me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll give you ten minutes.
Ann Perkins,"You have to try to eat something, okay?"
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,"Wow, that's amazing."
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Chris Traeger,This one's not as good.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Chris, here's the plan."
Andy Dwyer,I'm just gonna list off happy things until you're cheered up.
Andy Dwyer,"Pizza, the beach, rock and roll music"
April Ludgate,and I'll list terrible things to bring you back down.
April Ludgate,"Smallpox, botched surgery, snails crawling out of your mouth."
Chris Traeger,This is weirdly working.
Chris Traeger,It's evening me out.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, keep going, keep going."
Andy Dwyer,Laughter.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your mouth.
Andy Dwyer,The beach.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out out of your mouth.
Andy Dwyer,Cute cats.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your butt.
Andy Dwyer,Dave Matthews Band.
April Ludgate,Dave Matthews Band.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Dad, Leslie worked really hard on this, so can you just cool it for, like, 30 seconds?"
Steve Wyatt,"Sure, I can."
Steve Wyatt,But your mother can't.
Steve Wyatt,See?
Steve Wyatt,"She's ruining your quilt, just like she ruined our marriage!"
Ben Wyatt,Mom!
Ulani,"Oh, I didn't know we could cut that."
Julia Wyatt,"It had to be done, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,It absolutely did not have to be done.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Look, champagne!"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt and just raise a glass?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Toasts are fun.
Ben Wyatt,They usually signify the end of a party.
Ben Wyatt,"Here you are, Ulani."
Ulani,"I'm good, thanks."
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, by all means, go ahead and take it, Ulani."
Julia Wyatt,"Or, wait, are you even old enough to drink?"
Ulani,"Yes, Julia, I am, but I can't because I'm pregnant."
Ben Wyatt,You're what?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, boy."
Steve Wyatt,"I didn't mean to steal your spotlight, but the cat's out of the bag."
Steve Wyatt,"Young Ben is going to have a new baby sister, huh?"
Steve Wyatt,"Still firing bullets, son."
Julia Wyatt,I cannot be in the same room as him.
Ben Wyatt,What about the wedding?
Julia Wyatt,I'm talking about the wedding.
Ben Wyatt,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Wyatt family."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's so brutal!"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Were you and Dad ever like that?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex."
Leslie Knope,La la la la la.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Anyway, the important thing is that we always ended up on the same team."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And in the same bed.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"God, I miss that man."
Leslie Knope,How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm a parent.
Tom Haverford,I can't figure out how to phrase this mission statement.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me get a shot at it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.
Tom Haverford,"See? You just googled, ""Amanda Bynes side boob."""
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What's wrong with you? Why is your safesearch on? That is amateur hour, Tom."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Listen, we've been at this for an entire evening."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I say, why don't we cut our losses? If it was such a good idea, we would be millionaires by now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hello.
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, I believe in this idea."
Tom Haverford,"Do you? You know I love you, but I don't think you're as serious about this business as I am."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, yeah, no, I'm definitely not."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got your text."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.
Leslie Knope,Get in the car.
Leslie Knope,We're going to Australia.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for everything.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I want to be on your team."
Leslie Knope,"I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here."
Ben Wyatt,"Normally, I would get in the cab with you, but I am so sick of them ruining everything, and I really liked that unity quilt."
Leslie Knope,It was a good quilt.
Ben Wyatt,It was an awesome quilt.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's time for this team to come up with a new plan.
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,"Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes."
Ben Wyatt,I would love to do that.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just not sure if the driver would be okay with it.
Extra,"For another 100 bucks, you can do whatever you want."
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Swan song!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What up, my man? Ow, are you kidding me?"
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.
Ron Swanson,I thought you and Tom were working on your presentation.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, I decided it was best if I took my talents elsewhere."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I mean?
Ron Swanson,You abandoned your friend?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"God, no."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He fired me, straight up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Talked about how I wasn't serious enough about the project, how he needed to grow up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Anyway, I have an amazing investment idea for you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Condoms with pictures on them.
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Good.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Smart.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I think you made the right decision.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Take care.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,Seems like the storm has passed.
Chris Traeger,Indeed it has.
Chris Traeger,I can't believe that I spent the entire party in a room being happy sad on a night that means so much to my two best friends.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're going through a lot."
Ann Perkins,You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.
April Ludgate,"This lesbian nurse is right, Chris."
April Ludgate,You can't keep it all bottled up.
Chris Traeger,Maybe you're right.
Chris Traeger,Maybe all of my emotions tumbling out like this means that I can get a clean start.
Ann Perkins,"Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first."
Ann Perkins,Right?
April Ludgate,No.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Chris Traeger,"You are, without a doubt, the queen of toilet humor."
Ann Perkins,That's all I ever wanted to be.
Ben Wyatt,This was supposed to be a happy occasion.
Ben Wyatt,"You were supposed to come here, celebrate your son's engagement, maybe bury the ax? And not in each other's back."
Leslie Knope,But it did not work out that way.
Leslie Knope,So here is the new plan.
Leslie Knope,"I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other."
Leslie Knope,You don't even have to socialize.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't."
Ben Wyatt,But you do have to show up and tell us that you had a great time.
Ben Wyatt,That's the deal.
