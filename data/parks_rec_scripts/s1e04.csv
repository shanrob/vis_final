Tom Haverford,"So, we've been called out to this hiking trail because there's some reports that some teenagers are digging bags of dog poop out of the trash and having dog poop fights."
Leslie Knope,I don't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's real.
Tom Haverford,"Uh Yeah, I'm not gonna go deal with this."
Tom Haverford,I'm leaving.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Boys!
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I work for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Extra,Nice!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,Cool it!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Extra,Get her shoes!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Smells so bad!
Leslie Knope,Why would you think this was fun?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You like it?
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,Who wants it?
Leslie Knope,"Whoo, missed it!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is a little fun."
Leslie Knope,This is fun.
Extra,Get her hair!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Check it out.
Jerry Gergich,Norton Construction just sent this over.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, mama!"
Jerry Gergich,I love Great Lakes wine.
Tom Haverford,You can have the wine.
Tom Haverford,I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,"You know as well as I do that we are not allowed to accept gifts over 25 dollars, for corruption reasons."
Leslie Knope,We live in a fish bowl and the public is always watching.
Leslie Knope,That's why I go two towns over if I want to rent a movie with nudity in it.
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,"But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up."
Tom Haverford,"When you're in government, there's a million ways to exploit your power."
Tom Haverford,Have I ever given in to that temptation?
Tom Haverford,"No, never."
Tom Haverford,I'm not that kind of politician.
Tom Haverford,Official Parks and Rec business.
Tom Haverford,Just need to grab a quick hot dog.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry about that, little girl, you can have the next one."
Tom Haverford,"I have a moral code, and I never violate it."
Tom Haverford,"People look at me and they say, ""Wow, Tom."""
Tom Haverford,"""You are so pure, you're like a brown Superman with a beard that just stands for justice and truth and the American way."""
Leslie Knope,"So, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready for the debut?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, can we cut that red ribbon around your monitor now?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,I love a good ribbon cutting.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"April, that's good."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Kids.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, look, the pit already has six friends."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,Mark's a friend.
Tom Haverford,"Well, you guys gotta see Mark's profile."
Tom Haverford,Look at the photos of these ladies on his page.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,Sick.
Leslie Knope,Maybe those are his relatives.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, maybe fake boobs run in his family."
Tom Haverford,Look at this lady.
Tom Haverford,She's got a thong on her face.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, his favorite movie is Dances With Wolves."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're good."
Leslie Knope,We'll keep checking in on this.
Ann Perkins,"Where is Mark, anyway?"
Leslie Knope,Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal."
Leslie Knope,Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.
Leslie Knope,"And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men."
Leslie Knope,It can be very upsetting.
Leslie Knope,Especially because of that guy.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,See?
Ann Perkins,What are they doing out there?
Leslie Knope,Wheeling and dealing.
Leslie Knope,Divvying up the empire.
Extra,"Oh, my wife got me this shirt."
Extra,She swears it makes me look thinner.
Mark Brendanawicz,It kind of does.
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,Let's go out there.
Leslie Knope,Let's bust up that old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,We're doing great work in the government.
Leslie Knope,We deserve to be included.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Ann Perkins,I could use a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"That's good, think like a man."
Leslie Knope,"April, we're leaving, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,And it's because you're a woman!
Extra,"What, do you really like red tape and uphill battles?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Mark Brendanawicz,What is up?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's up.
Leslie Knope,A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,Glad to have you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let me get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,We're in.
Brian,"Hey, I'm Brian."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Deputy director of--
Mark Brendanawicz,Drink that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"I'm Ann, everyone."
Ann Perkins,I don't work here.
Extra,"Hey, Ann."
Extra,Steve.
Leslie Knope,"So, what are you guys talking about?"
Leslie Knope,What's the topic du jour?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.
Leslie Knope,"The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you gotta loosen up."
Leslie Knope,I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me."
Ann Perkins,"So, is this, like, your regular Tuesday night scene?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, it's just a way to unwind, you know."
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Ann Perkins,"Really different from your Friday night crowd, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,What crowd?
Ann Perkins,"You know, the girls with the tribal back tattoos who drink Red Bull for a living."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like this."
Leslie Knope,This is banter.
Ann Perkins,That crowd.
Leslie Knope,Banter's fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where'd that come from?
Ann Perkins,"We were just on the computer, looking at your profile."
Ann Perkins,"You know, you have a friend who has a tattoo that says, ""Daddy's Girl."""
Ann Perkins,And both words are misspelled.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Mixing it up with the boys!
Leslie Knope,So What are you gonna say?
Leslie Knope,What's your comeback?
Mark Brendanawicz,Those aren't really my friends anymore.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't hang out with them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boo."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce."
Leslie Knope,You need to hit harder!
April Ludgate,"Natalie, it's your sister."
April Ludgate,Pick me up or I'm gonna draw all over your jeans.
Extra,"Well, it's official, people."
Extra,We're out of beer.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's the cue.
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you later, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It was nice hanging out, you know, after work hours."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Ann Perkins,"I think I'm gonna take off, too."
Extra,"Yeah, I should go, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,Let's keep this good feeling going.
Leslie Knope,It's just getting started!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get started when you run out of booze."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just hold on a second.
Leslie Knope,I got wine!
All,Hey!
Leslie Knope,And cheese!
All,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed."
Leslie Knope,"I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order."
Leslie Knope,"Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,I am sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Melissa Bean.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Double shift, remember?"
Ann Perkins,So I won't see you till tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna be okay?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,I got dinner.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?"
Andy Dwyer,I'll try.
Andy Dwyer,Don't expect much.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'll do it when I get home.
Andy Dwyer,You will?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"She takes care of me, she takes care of sick people, sick babies."
Andy Dwyer,She is an angel.
Andy Dwyer,And I seriously love her.
Andy Dwyer,Hard.
Andy Dwyer,She's going to be gone for the next 24 hours so I made this list and basically this place is gonna be like a sparkling palace when she returns.
Andy Dwyer,I took a bunch of painkillers.
Andy Dwyer,They're about to kick in so I'm ready to go.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Let's clear the air.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure."
Tom Haverford,Really.
Tom Haverford,Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,Usually such a prudish stickler for the rules.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not happy about it either, Tom."
Tom Haverford,It's like I don't even know you anymore.
Jerry Gergich,Last year you wrote me up for making personal phone calls to my mom.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,And I would do it again.
Leslie Knope,Two wrongs do not make a right.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, but she was in the hospital."
Leslie Knope,I did not know that at the time.
Donna Meagle,"So, can I have the basket?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,It's evidence.
Donna Meagle,It's a nice basket.
Jerry Gergich,What would you put in there?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Potpourri?
Tom Haverford,That's a lot of potpourri.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I am not the one on trial here."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.
Tom Haverford,I think you should go to jail.
Tom Haverford,Think about what you've done.
Ron Swanson,Go to jail?
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you."
Ron Swanson,Put it in an email?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"It happened right out there, right outside this window."
Leslie Knope,Why can't I look away?
Ron Swanson,Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Leslie Knope,I will blow this in proportion!
Leslie Knope,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.
Ron Swanson,It's not that big a deal.
Leslie Knope,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache."
Leslie Knope,But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,You're punishing yourself more than anybody else is gonna punish you.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What do you suggest we do?
Leslie Knope,You think we should cover this up?
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not saying that."
Ron Swanson,No one said cover up.
Leslie Knope,"Good, because the coverup is worse than the crime."
Leslie Knope,"When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty."
Ron Swanson,Please don't make this worse.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made."
Leslie Knope,"I have written a full confession, which I will be emailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government."
Leslie Knope,"I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do."
Leslie Knope,"I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused."
Leslie Knope,And that is why I had to whistle blow myself.
Andy Dwyer,"I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm kind of a nester.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Extra,Hey.
April Ludgate,I'm doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker.
April Ludgate,Drinking wine--
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Come here.
Tom Haverford,See what April put on the pit's web page.
April Ludgate,"Right now, drinking wine is winning--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What am I looking at?
April Ludgate,A video of me drinking some of that wine you stole.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
April Ludgate,"Because I was waiting for my sister and I was bored, and my hair looked really good."
Leslie Knope,And you put it in the pit's web page?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take this off."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just sent an email to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!"
Tom Haverford,A young lawbreaker.
Tom Haverford,A future Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,"Play it again for us, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Ron Swanson,She's 19 years old.
Ron Swanson,I thought I told you not to make this worse.
Leslie Knope,And I heard you loud and clear.
Ron Swanson,But then you made it worse.
Ron Swanson,"The disciplinary committee is having a hearing tomorrow, and you're gonna have to testify."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,April might get dismissed.
Ron Swanson,You could get fired.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,This bench is so uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay."
Leslie Knope,Tell me it's gonna be okay.
Ron Swanson,It's gonnaâ¦
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Ron Swanson,It's It'II Hang in.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,You're okay.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to-- I don't want to talk about it anymore."
Tom Haverford,"So, the disciplinary committee awaits."
Tom Haverford,Feeling good?
Tom Haverford,Feeling strong?
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Do you want me to run some test questions with you?
Tom Haverford,Maybe give you an idea of what the disciplinary committee will be like?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that'd be great."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, Miss Knope, you're accused of stealing wine."
Tom Haverford,"How many drinks do you have per week, on average?"
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna write down 10.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Do you ever cheat on your taxes?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Never.
Tom Haverford,Good.
Tom Haverford,You're doing great.
Tom Haverford,How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
Leslie Knope,Are they gonna ask that?
Tom Haverford,"This is a deposition style hearing, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,Nothing is off limits.
Tom Haverford,You have to answer.
Tom Haverford,"Now, how many sexual partners have you had in the last year?"
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Tom Haverford,Have you ever thought about Ron sexually?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Including dreams.
Tom Haverford,"Have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss, Ron Swanson?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Now, in this recurring dream that you have about Ron, is he like a regular Ron, or is he half Ron, half animal, like a centaur?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,No Is he wearing a football uniform?
Tom Haverford,Are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his mustache?
Tom Haverford,Is he covered in Powerade?
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Tom Haverford,"This committee doesn't take timeouts, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,Now answer the question!
Leslie Knope,I need something to drink.
Tom Haverford,How about some stolen wine?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I meant water.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you for your time, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,You're fired.
Tom Haverford,"So, that's kind of your worst case scenario, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"If you can handle that, I think you'll be fine."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for being here with me today."
Ron Swanson,I'm your department head.
Ron Swanson,I have to be.
Leslie Knope,Nonetheless.
Extra,Ms. Knope?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Extra,You're here because you allegedly accepted a gift of over 25 dollars and contributed to the delinquency of a minor.
Extra,Can you tell us what happened?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may."
Extra,Certainly.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"""Two days ago, I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time."""
Leslie Knope,"""After one and a half beers, awash in the glow of acceptance into this elite, exclusive club"""
Extra,"Sorry, what club is this?"
Ron Swanson,A couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on Tuesday nights.
Extra,No one is supposed to drink alcohol on government property.
Ron Swanson,That's not my department.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, Leslie."
,"""I made a very unwise decision."""
Leslie Knope,"""A decision that will live in infamy."""
Leslie Knope,"""I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese."""
Leslie Knope,"""Our intern, April Ludgate, drank some of that wine without my knowledge."""
Leslie Knope,"""That was never part of the plan."""
Leslie Knope,"""She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club."""
Leslie Knope,"""I repeat, not been invited."""
Leslie Knope,"""Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history."""
Extra,But you did open the gift basket.
Extra,And the intern did drink the wine.
Leslie Knope,Please don't blame her for my mistake.
Leslie Knope,The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.
Andy Dwyer,"There's only one more thing I need to clean, me."
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I can't really get into a shower, so I got this idea from my parents."
Andy Dwyer,This is how they clean their dog.
Andy Dwyer,Do you like that? Huh? I wrote that for Ann.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be playing when she walks through the door today.
Andy Dwyer,And check this out.
Andy Dwyer,Washed my shorts.
Andy Dwyer,How do you like that?
Lawrence,Hey.
Lawrence,Turn that down.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,I wrote that song.
Lawrence,I don't care.
Lawrence,Turn it down.
Andy Dwyer,"What are you doing in my yard, Lawrence? Get out of here."
Lawrence,"Okay, you know what? I'm taking this."
Andy Dwyer,Put down my boom box.
Lawrence,It's my boom box now.
Lawrence,I asked you nicely.
Andy Dwyer,"You did not ask me nicely! Put that down! I just put 12 new batteries in that thing! Lawrence, come on!"
Extra,What's going on out here?
Andy Dwyer,Give it to me! Come on.
Andy Dwyer,"Go back inside, Hank."
Extra,"Miss Knope, what was the first thing you did when you arrived at work the next day? Can you go over the time line for us once more?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,I awoke at 6:21 a.m. after a fitful night of sleep.
Ron Swanson,We've been over this.
Ron Swanson,What more could you guys possibly want her to do?
Extra,"Well, we don't know yet."
Extra,Frankly we've got a lot more questions.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Ron Swanson,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,This is not communist China.
Ron Swanson,You cannot make her whip herself.
Ron Swanson,You cannot make her wear a hair shirt.
Extra,We weren't planning on doing either of those things.
Ron Swanson,This is America.
Ron Swanson,"You want to live in North Korea, you can live in North Korea."
Ron Swanson,I don't want to.
Ron Swanson,I want to live in America.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying."
Ron Swanson,"If you want to slap her on the wrist, go ahead."
Ron Swanson,"If you want to do anything more serious, you're gonna have to go through me."
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Are we done?
Ron Swanson,"We're done, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"So, after all that, it's really not that bad."
Ron Swanson,You're gonna get a letter in your file.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so--"
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about it.
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't do it for Leslie."
Ron Swanson,I did it because I hate bureaucracy.
Ron Swanson,"My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke."
Ron Swanson,"The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon."
Ron Swanson,"And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I came from the hospital."
Ann Perkins,How'd it go?
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like 100 years in hell and the absolute worst day of my life."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I never should have opened that stupid basket.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Why did you open that basket? It doesn't really seem like you.
Leslie Knope,I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.
Ann Perkins,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,I did it for a guy.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Leslie Knope,We had a brief affair in February of 2004.
Leslie Knope,"And there's still something very complicated between us, soâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Smart woman.
Ann Perkins,Iffy choice in men.
Ann Perkins,"But then again, I'm not one to talk."
Andy Dwyer,What do you think?
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,This is so sweet.
Andy Dwyer,It's nothing.
Ann Perkins,What happened to you?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I was chasing our neighbor who's a total jagweed and I fell in some prickly bushes."
Andy Dwyer,Doesn't matter.
Andy Dwyer,"What do you think of the house, huh? Were you totally surprised?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Do you love it?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Here, baby."
Ann Perkins,Sit down.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna put something on those scratches.
Andy Dwyer,Somebody is getting gently laid tonight.
Ann Perkins,Andy! God!
Mark Brendanawicz,You look like you need one of these.
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're over 21.
Leslie Knope,You're not supposed to be drinking on government property.
Mark Brendanawicz,Loosen up.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I have a letter in my file."
Mark Brendanawicz,I got seven letters in my file.
Mark Brendanawicz,Pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, welcome to the team."
Leslie Knope,"Look out, boys."
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club now.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Creepy.
