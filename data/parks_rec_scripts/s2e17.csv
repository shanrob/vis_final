Men's Soccer Coach,Are you kidding?
Men's Soccer Coach,"""I was here first""?"
Men's Soccer Coach,Get lost!
Ian Winston,We were here first.
Men's Soccer Coach,But we're scheduled for this time on this field.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is no way for adults to act in front of children."
Leslie Knope,"You're not only coaches, you're also role models."
Men's Soccer Coach,I would hardly call what he does coaching.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Excellent role modeling.
Leslie Knope,"Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,"Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?"
Ian Winston,I'm the girls' coach.
Ian Winston,She's the boys' coach.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Men's Soccer Coach,That's sexist.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Ian Winston,Yeah.
Ian Winston,It kind of is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, why don't the boys take the field today."
Leslie Knope,And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.
Leslie Knope,"And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!"
Child,I'm a boy.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,'Cause I wasn't talking to you.
Leslie Knope,I was talking to you.
Leslie Knope,"You're a girl, right?"
Child,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,She.
Donna Meagle,Mail's here.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
April Ludgate,Jerry!
April Ludgate,You got soup all over our mail!
April Ludgate,You jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!
Leslie Knope,Nobody freak out!
Leslie Knope,Do you know what this means?
Leslie Knope,I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!
Leslie Knope,The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.
Leslie Knope,I have been a dues paying member since I was nine.
Leslie Knope,"And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award."
Leslie Knope,Winning is every girl's dream.
Leslie Knope,But it's my destiny.
Leslie Knope,And my dream.
Leslie Knope,"Can you read it, please?"
Leslie Knope,Where are my ladies at?
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
April Ludgate,"""The IOW is proud to announce this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award Winner, Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,Haha.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, pretty funny."
April Ludgate,It says Ronald Swanson.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, it doesn't."
Leslie Knope,I-- That-- No.
Leslie Knope,That-- What?
Leslie Knope,They only honor women.
Leslie Knope,And Ron's the opposite of a woman.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"You're Pawnee's Woman of the Year, it looks like."
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's about time."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,They've obviously made some sort of mistake.
Ron Swanson,Bully for me!
Jerry Gergich,"Congratulations, Ron."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, congratulations."
Donna Meagle,Congrats.
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
Donna Meagle,It's very exciting.
Ron Swanson,"Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense, and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard, and I don't."
Ron Swanson,"However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it."
Ron Swanson,"Well, we can't stand around all day congratulating me on receiving an award from some lousy women's organization."
Ron Swanson,"Back to work, everyone."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Freddy."
Tom Haverford,Good news!
Tom Haverford,"Your liquor license renewal got got, yo."
Freddy,What do you mean by that?
Tom Haverford,I got you temporary approval from the liquor board pending full board authorization and council review.
Tom Haverford,Got got.
Freddy,Thank you.
Freddy,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,No worries.
Tom Haverford,You know the Snakehole's my favorite Pawnee hot spot.
Tom Haverford,I want to open up my own club one day.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe call it something like Cluba-Dub-Dub or The Clubmarine, sort of a submarine themed club."
Tom Haverford,Or Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,"The word ""bistro"" is classy as [bleep]."
Freddy,"Tom, we are looking for a few top quality guys like yourself to become part owners."
Freddy,"A guy like you, with your political connections, I think you'd make a great asset."
Tom Haverford,I agree.
Tom Haverford,That's why I got into public service.
Tom Haverford,To help me.
Freddy,All right.
Freddy,"10,000 dollars a share."
Freddy,I need the money by Friday.
Tom Haverford,10000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,That's chump change.
Tom Haverford,"I will see you Friday with 10,000 dollars."
Freddy,"All right, partner."
Leslie Knope,I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, it's a bummer."
Leslie Knope,"One, he's not a woman."
Leslie Knope,"And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter."
Leslie Knope,That's my project.
Leslie Knope,I started that.
Leslie Knope,It was my brainchild.
Leslie Knope,Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?
Mark Brendanawicz,He wouldn't?
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,I deserve that award.
Leslie Knope,That award is mine.
Leslie Knope,Not his.
Leslie Knope,It's mine.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,"I know, I already started a list."
Leslie Knope,"""Write an email to Barack Obama."""
Leslie Knope,"""Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice."""
Leslie Knope,That's all I have so far.
Mark Brendanawicz,I was gonna suggest maybe you just go and talk to him.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're only gonna get more resentful if you don't.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,How--
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,I have so much I need to tell you right now.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie would like to talk to you for a moment.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that all right?
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Big T!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What it do, nephew?"
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, I have a hot investment opportunity that you are gonna wanna jump all over."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hit me with it, daddy."
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole Lounge--
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Heard of it.
Tom Haverford,Is looking for investors.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No way.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yesterday, if you would have asked me, I would've said no, but thank God, my grandfather just died, so I am a flush with cash!"
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"I have 4,000 bucks."
Tom Haverford,All I need you to do is kick in six G's.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Six G's.
Tom Haverford,And then you and I are part owners of the hottest nightclub in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Also, sorry about your grandpa."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No worries.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,He was a dick.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Here's the thing.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I can kick in five G's.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That should be enough, right?"
Tom Haverford,"No, it's not enough."
Tom Haverford,I just said I need six G's.
Tom Haverford,What about your trust fund?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My parents had it amended.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I don't get anything until I'm 50, which is a waste, 'cause I'm gonna be a billionaire in Costa Rica by then, eating dolphins and hanging out with lady singers."
Tom Haverford,It's not a huge deal.
Tom Haverford,Just sit tight.
Tom Haverford,I'll take care of it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You wanna come home with me?
April Ludgate,Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?
Burly,"Look, if you're not gonna pay rent, at least clean up your dishes."
Andy Dwyer,Is that all?
Burly,No.
Burly,"Also, The Bag of Smells was a fun experiment, but it has to stop."
Andy Dwyer,Come on!
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,We're finally starting to get serious results.
Burly,"Andy, dude, I love you, but shape up or move out."
April Ludgate,What's going on?
Andy Dwyer,The guitarist from my band is driving me crazy.
Andy Dwyer,He's such a control freak.
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a working fireplace, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Stop writing phone messages on the wall, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Dude, seriously, I love you but stop digging that weird hole in the backyard."""
April Ludgate,Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we're not Mouse Rat anymore."
Andy Dwyer,We changed it to Tackleshaft.
April Ludgate,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I should just get my own place.
April Ludgate,You should.
April Ludgate,I'll help you.
Andy Dwyer,You can help me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that'd be fun."
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're like an angel with no wings."
April Ludgate,"So, like, a person?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What's in the envelope?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me?
Leslie Knope,I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,You're saying a women's organization made a mistake?
Leslie Knope,I was as surprised as you were.
Leslie Knope,"But the fact is, they only give that award to women."
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it definitely said Ron Swanson in the letter."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Camp Xena.
Leslie Knope,Athena.
Leslie Knope,Camp Athena.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know the name.
Ron Swanson,I almost got it.
Ron Swanson,I was pretty close.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Leslie, your job, which you're great at, is making me look good."
Ron Swanson,Which you've clearly done well because I'm getting an award.
Ron Swanson,Right?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Be proud of yourself.
Ron Swanson,You deserve an award.
Ron Swanson,"Not this one, obviously, this one belongs to me, but some other one."
Ron Swanson,Some other lesser award.
Ron Swanson,"And if the shoe were on the other foot and you won the award, I would've congratulated you."
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Ron Swanson,What's that?
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Ian Winston,You promised the girls a field by the end of this week.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a man's world, Winston."
Leslie Knope,Get used to it.
Ian Winston,I'm a man.
Leslie Knope,You know who you should talk to?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,He's an award winning public servant.
Leslie Knope,He's the guy that's gonna help you out.
Leslie Knope,Go on in there.
April Ludgate,Excuse me?
April Ludgate,"Ron, someone's coming in."
Ian Winston,Hi.
Ian Winston,Leslie said I should come over here.
Leslie Knope,"If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?"
Leslie Knope,Because I love it!
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to make a point!
Tom Haverford,This VIP card gives you exclusive access to the investment opportunity of a lifetime.
Tom Haverford,Where?
Tom Haverford,Multipurpose Room F.
Tom Haverford,When?
Tom Haverford,3:00 p.m.
Tom Haverford,Dress code?
Tom Haverford,Black tie optional.
Tom Haverford,Just like life.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, yes."
Ron Swanson,Just hang on one second.
Ron Swanson,I'm doing my official portrait for the IUD Awards Dinner Program.
Leslie Knope,IOW.
Ron Swanson,"No, this portrait is not official in any way."
Ron Swanson,I'm paying for it myself.
Leslie Knope,Did you need me?
Leslie Knope,Because some of us actually do work around here.
Leslie Knope,Work that often goes unrewarded.
Ron Swanson,I need your opinion.
Ron Swanson,Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait?
Ron Swanson,A pot?
Ron Swanson,Or this Deputy Director Barbie?
Ron Swanson,Isn't it adorable?
Ron Swanson,"She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone."
Ron Swanson,"""I'm going to help my boss win an award."""
Leslie Knope,How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?
Leslie Knope,"Take care of that, did you?"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Passed the buck to Donna.
Leslie Knope,That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.
Ron Swanson,Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
April Ludgate,"So, what kind of place are you looking for?"
Andy Dwyer,"I can afford, like, 300 bucks a month. I've always wanted a doorman named Ernie."
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Or Kipp.
Andy Dwyer,I'm pretty flexible on that.
April Ludgate,Here's a great one.
April Ludgate,It's a Tudor mansion.
April Ludgate,"It's got seven rooms, four bathrooms."
April Ludgate,"It's got a tennis court, a pool and a three car garage."
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"And it's only 20,000 dollars a month."
April Ludgate,And it's in Chicago.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That close!
Andy Dwyer,It was almost perfect.
April Ludgate,"Actually, there are a couple of cool places in here."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go look at them!
April Ludgate,Now?
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Thank you all so much for joining me today.
Tom Haverford,I have two questions for you.
Tom Haverford,"One, are you ready for the investment opportunity of a lifetime?"
Tom Haverford,"And two, do any of you have pacemakers or a history of epilepsy?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, both."
Tom Haverford,Anybody?
Tom Haverford,No?
Jerry Gergich,Both.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Ladies!
Tom Haverford,Jay-Z.
Tom Haverford,Rihanna.
Tom Haverford,Audrina Patridge.
Tom Haverford,Jon Gosselin.
Tom Haverford,Lady Gaga.
Tom Haverford,Snooki.
Jerry Gergich,Are these real people?
Tom Haverford,Cash Warren and Dennis Rodman.
Tom Haverford,These are just a few of the celebrities that wish they could invest in Pawnee's hottest club.
Tom Haverford,But they can't.
Tom Haverford,And you can.
Tom Haverford,"For the small price of only one, one, one, thousand, thousand, thousand dollars, dollars, dollars!"
Tom Haverford,"The only question is, who's gonna be my partner?"
Tom Haverford,"Mark, I'm talking to you!"
Tom Haverford,"Donna, I'm talking to you!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,I'm talking to you!
Tom Haverford,Mark!
Tom Haverford,I'm talking to you!
Leslie Knope,"Twenty-six certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements."
Ron Swanson,"What do you have, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I have the Dorothy Every Time Smurf Girl Trophy for excellence in female stuff.
Leslie Knope,Dorothy Everton Smythe.
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, I would--"
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Before you continue, please read this."
Leslie Knope,Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?
Leslie Knope,"""I, Ron Swanson, recognize that Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award for all the hard work she has done, especially for the Camp Athena project."""
Leslie Knope,"""However, in my opinion, she is far too concerned with institutional gratification."""
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"""So, I am going to let her dangle in order to show her that awards are bull crap."""
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Leslie, you know I'm not sexist."
Ron Swanson,I love powerful women.
Leslie Knope,You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
Ron Swanson,"I'm just saying that awards are political, and everybody has an agenda."
Ron Swanson,"If you spend your life chasing them, you'll drive yourself nuts."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.
Leslie Knope,She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear pants on a Sunday.
Leslie Knope,She spent four years in jail for that.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm not supposed to care about these things, but this one means a lot."
Andy Dwyer,I know you've been changing--
Andy Dwyer,The acoustics in the bathroom are insane.
April Ludgate,"So, how much is this one again?"
Realtor,"This one is 425 a month, plus utilities."
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,"It seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of ""advantages,"" per se."
Andy Dwyer,I could definitely picture myself doing something over there.
Andy Dwyer,Can you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Realtor,It's still on.
Andy Dwyer,You can light a match to get rid of that smell.
Andy Dwyer,I feel really good about this.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,It screams Andy Dwyer.
April Ludgate,And I live nearby.
April Ludgate,"So, we could, like, carpool to work or something."
Andy Dwyer,Are you serious?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,The scream just got louder.
Realtor,"So, what do you think?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Make me an offer.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"First come, first served."
Tom Haverford,Who's in?
Tom Haverford,Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, Tom, if I spend any more than 25 bucks, I gotta ask my wife."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, get out."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"""Mark? What are we doing tonight?"""
Tom Haverford,"""I don't know, Ann."""
Tom Haverford,"""We could do the usual boring stuff like eat some chicken salad with some crackers, or watch the payperview, or we could go to my nightclub and do some dancing."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't think so, man."
Tom Haverford,You'd never have to beg for sex again.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna get into this, really, but I don't beg for sex now."
Tom Haverford,"Forget about that, Mark."
Tom Haverford,Are you in or out?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's just not really my thing.
Cindy,"Bye, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Cindy.
Tom Haverford,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Maybe.
Donna Meagle,I like The Snakehole.
Donna Meagle,"Plus, I would look good pulling into my owner's parking space in my Mercedes."
Tom Haverford,"Just to be clear, you wouldn't be an owner, per se."
Tom Haverford,"You, me and my boy, Jean-Ralphio, would each own part of a share."
Tom Haverford,Will that be cash or check?
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle,I like to know who I'm in business with.
Donna Meagle,I want to meet your boy.
April Ludgate,In here.
April Ludgate,This lady's here.
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, I'm Elise Yarktin, I'm with the IOW."
Ron Swanson,"I'm Woman of the Year, Ron Swanson."
Elise Yarktin,"Yes, I know."
Elise Yarktin,We are very excited to be presenting you with the Smythe Award.
Ron Swanson,That's what I called you to talk about.
Ron Swanson,I don't know if I can take all of the excitement.
Ron Swanson,"So, I think the award should go to Miss Knope, here."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Ron Swanson,She's the one who really deserves it.
Ron Swanson,Camp Athena was her idea.
Ron Swanson,She did all the work.
Ron Swanson,You made a mistake.
Elise Yarktin,We didn't make a mistake.
Elise Yarktin,We made a very conscious decision this year to choose a man.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Elise Yarktin,"Well, every year, we give it to a woman, and, frankly, nobody cares."
Elise Yarktin,"Yeah, the media has all but written us off as a niche interest group."
Elise Yarktin,"But if you give a women's award to a mustachioed, masculine man, such as yourself, well, then, eventually, people take notice."
Ron Swanson,I don't want the damn thing.
Elise Yarktin,"Well, we're giving it to you."
Elise Yarktin,"So, you're gonna take it, like a man."
Elise Yarktin,So congratulations.
Leslie Knope,"The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Ron Swanson,Now do you see how silly these things are?
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Ron Swanson,"Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it."
Leslie Knope,"No, I want you to accept it."
Leslie Knope,I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are.
Leslie Knope,And how they are superficial and meaningless.
Leslie Knope,I want you to rip awards a new a-hole!
Ron Swanson,Now we're talking.
Ron Swanson,I tell you what.
Ron Swanson,You write the speech.
Ron Swanson,Don't pull your punches.
Leslie Knope,I won't.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend!
Ron Swanson,Attagirl.
Ron Swanson,Kind of.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What up, Big T! Stop."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This must be the lovely Donna.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Enchante.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Listen, beautiful, let's cut the bull, right? You want this."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I definitely want this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,T.H. wants this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Let's seal this devil's three way right here, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Step one, we buy into this club."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Step two, we roll over to the club, either in your Mercedes Benz or my pre-owned Acura Legend."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Step three, I dagger you on the dance floor."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce-- Now, all the ladies say it, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. What do you say, sexy?"
Donna Meagle,I'm out.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Donna Meagle,I hate that guy.
Elise Yarktin,Mr. Swanson.
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, welcome to the IOW Awards, and congratulations on winning."
Ron Swanson,Yay!
Elise Yarktin,"Well, here is your awards packet, and if you will just follow me, we're gonna have a little meet-and-greet before the ceremony."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Elise Yarktin,Great.
Elise Yarktin,"No, I'm sorry."
Elise Yarktin,This area is for award winners only.
Leslie Knope,"Get over yourself, Elise."
Ron Swanson,Work on the speech.
Ron Swanson,Let's nail these women.
Ron Swanson,You know what I mean.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, Andy."
Tom Haverford,What's it all about? What's the secret?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Why's it so hard to become a mogul? All I want in life is to own a nightclub on every continent, have my own line of upscale sweat suits, and a cologne called Tommy Fresh."
Tom Haverford,"And I fell 1,000 dollars short."
Andy Dwyer,"Seriously? That's all you needed? Tom, I have 1,000 dollars."
Andy Dwyer,You can have it.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Andy, but I can't take your money."
Andy Dwyer,I'm a singer songwriter.
Andy Dwyer,"The two lines I've put into every song I've ever sang, ""Spread your wings and fly,"" and ""You deserve to be a champion."""
Andy Dwyer,"If you're telling me that all you need is 1,000 dollars to do your dreams, then I want you to have it."
Tom Haverford,Are you sure about this?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Tom Haverford,You don't know how happy you just made me.
Elise Yarktin,He's the Director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department.
Elise Yarktin,He is also the recipient of this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award.
Elise Yarktin,Please put your hands together for Mr. Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Every award, from the smallest trophy to the Nobel Prize, is nothing more than... Is nothing more than a great way to honor someone."
Ron Swanson,"So, I would like to present this year's Dottie English Whatever Award to the person who actually deserves it, Leslie Knope."
Ron Swanson,"Come on up here, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to say.
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I'm just very honored to work for someone as insightful and kind as my boss."
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to present this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Award to Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,I don't want it.
Ron Swanson,Just take the damn thing.
Leslie Knope,You deserve it.
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,Really.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron, you deserve it."
Ron Swanson,"Really, but I don't want it."
Leslie Knope,But you won it.
Leslie Knope,And you should win it.
Ron Swanson,You should take it.
Ron Swanson,After that whole conversation--
Leslie Knope,I'm being ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,You've done--
Elise Yarktin,Could someone please just take it?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take it."
Leslie Knope,Who do I speak to about getting this changed?
Audience Member,Get off the stage!
Audience Member,Yeah!
Ron Swanson,I still think awards are stupid.
Ron Swanson,But they'd be less stupid if they went to the right people.
April Ludgate,You gave Tom all your money?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, well, I'm investing."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm like Warren ""Buffay."""
April Ludgate,I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I know."
Andy Dwyer,"But I feel like Tom really needed the money, and small sacrifice to see one of your best friends' dreams come true."
Ron Swanson,They cropped you out.
Leslie Knope,Figures.
Ron Swanson,"So, where are you gonna put it?"
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Ron Swanson,"Two, three."
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,How long did you wait in line? I didn't wait at all! I'm a part owner.
Tom Haverford,Freddy! I'm back.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, part owner."
Tom Haverford,Let me know if you need anything.
Tom Haverford,Keep this booth warm for me every night.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna live in this booth.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."
Tom Haverford,Donna? What are you doing here?
Donna Meagle,I bought three shares.
Donna Meagle,Thanks for the tip.
