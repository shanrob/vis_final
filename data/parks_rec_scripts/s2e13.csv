Ron Swanson,Potential problem.
Ron Swanson,"The previous owner of Lot 48, Norquist Properties, is claiming the government screwed them by illegally seizing the land."
Leslie Knope,I know about this issue.
Leslie Knope,"I called the city attorney, like, 50 times."
Leslie Knope,He didn't call me back.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you need a lawyer?"
Ann Perkins,Because my friend Justin's a lawyer.
Ann Perkins,I'm sure he could help.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that'd be terrific."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I'll call him.
Ann Perkins,Justin's the greatest guy ever.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""The greatest guy ever""?"
Tom Haverford,But does he dress this well?
Tom Haverford,Brooks Brothers.
Tom Haverford,Bought it right off the mannequin.
George MacFayden,Ron Swanson?
Ron Swanson,That's me.
George MacFayden,My name is George MacFayden.
George MacFayden,I wanted to talk to you about the amount of snow in the parks.
Ron Swanson,"I've been getting a lot of visitors recently, thanks to a stupid and worthless new push to make government officials more accessible to the public."
Extra,There is a disturbing lack of benches in Ramsett Park!
Extra,I want to sit more!
Extra,And another thing I like is the layout of the hiking trails.
Extra,I made this in one of your pottery classes.
Extra,It's terrible.
Ron Swanson,This is my hell.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"All right, so Tom, here's your chicken caesar salad, no dressing, no cheese, no croutons, no taste."
Tom Haverford,And no carbs.
Ann Perkins,"And for you madam, the Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"I can not believe the cafeteria named a sandwich after you, that is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,Salami on pumpernickel with olice juice and extra iceberg.
Leslie Knope,It was the only sandwich on the board that wasn't named.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I liked it.
Ann Perkins,So how are you feeling about the whole Dave situation?
Leslie Knope,"I really miss him. Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy the memories."
Ann Perkins,"Aw, that's a sweet picture."
Leslie Knope,"I know, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,"I asked the police department if I could have it, and they said no, so I stole it."
Ann Perkins,I have an idea. Why don't you let me set you up?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, it feels a little too soon."
Ann Perkins,"I'm telling you, this is the best way to get over someone."
Ann Perkins,Just get back on that horse.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe."
Ann Perkins,I feel sorry for Leslie.
Ann Perkins,It's really hard to end a relationship because of distance.
Ann Perkins,"Although, that's pretty much why I broke up with Andy."
Ann Perkins,He lived way too close to me.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, 12:15! You're early today."
Jerry Gergich,"April, there's no paper in the printer."
April Ludgate,So?
Jerry Gergich,So that's the one thing you do.
Ron Swanson,Attention.
Ron Swanson,"April, stop doing that."
April Ludgate,"Jerry told me to, so it's super crucial."
Ron Swanson,More important and more important than anything in this godforsaken world is finding me an assistant.
Tom Haverford,You get an assistant now?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I've always been able to have one, but I've turned it down because it's a waste of money."
Ron Swanson,"In the eight years I've had this job, I've saved the taxpayers of this city more than 150 grand."
Ron Swanson,"But now, I need the taxpayers' money to save me from the taxpayers."
Ron Swanson,Post this at your college.
April Ludgate,This looks like an ad for nothing.
Ron Swanson,"Please be careful with it, it's my only copy."
Justin,Leslie?
Justin,"Ann's friend, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, yeah, of course!"
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming in.
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,Not a problem.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Justin,"I should warn you, land seizure isn't really my specialty, but I'm happy to take a look."
Justin,Any friend of Ann's--
Leslie Knope,Is a friend of mine!
Leslie Knope,"That's my motto, too."
Leslie Knope,"So, what is your specialty?"
Leslie Knope,Is it locking up the bad guys or keeping them on the streets?
Justin,Neither.
Justin,"Civil litigation, mostly."
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Justin,It can be.
Justin,I've got this crazy case-- Have you ever heard of this product Fire in a Can?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I love those commercials!"
Leslie Knope,"If you want to start a fire, But you have to do it fast--"
Justin,"Well, you shouldn't buy it."
Justin,It'll literally burn your hand clean off.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Justin,Mmmhmm.
Justin,It is an aerosol can with an igniter and a trigger.
Justin,"It's essentially a blowtorch, and if you can believe it, it was invented to warm up baby bottles."
Leslie Knope,"This is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Justin,Tom.
Justin,Justin.
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Tom Haverford,"You are wearing the hell out of that suit, sir."
Tom Haverford,"Banana, two button."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go into the conference room."
Leslie Knope,I've got everything laid out.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, stop."
Tom Haverford,We should talk later.
Justin,"You are very organized, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I am."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Justin,I love what you do.
Justin,You have the coolest job.
Justin,Let me guess.
Justin,This is our park.
Justin,I want to know everything about this.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, these green things represent trees."
April Ludgate,"I come in, like, two hours late because I had to finish watching Swimfan because it was on, and everyone, like, jumped down my throat."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man."
April Ludgate,I can't wait till my internship is over so I can get the hell out of here.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you're all set."
Andy Dwyer,"Free of charge, of course."
April Ludgate,"Hey, why don't you sell your band's CDs here?"
Andy Dwyer,That is a brilliant idea.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot believe I didn't think of that.
Andy Dwyer,I have been writing a lot of songs about shining shoes lately.
Andy Dwyer,I tend to write about what I'm doing.
Andy Dwyer,"Talking about writing about what I'm doing, Now I'm singing about talking about writing about what I'm doing"
Justin,"Of course I'm gonna have to take a closer look at these things, but my gut's telling me this is not gonna be a big deal."
Justin,Companies make bogus claims like this all the time.
Justin,I think you're gonna be just fine.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,I know you're really busy.
Justin,"Please, my pleasure."
Justin,"At least this stuff is interesting, you know?"
Justin,"You know, it actually reminds me, two years ago, I was in Borneo officiating a wedding, and this enormous medicine man showed up and he was there to basically tell--"
Ann Perkins,Justin!
Justin,"Hey, kiddo!"
Justin,How you doing?
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,I'm good.
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen you in forever!
Justin,I know!
Justin,It's so good to see you.
Ann Perkins,"You, too."
Ann Perkins,Do you want to grab some dinner?
Justin,"Uh, I would love to."
Justin,I cannot.
Justin,I am swamped.
Ann Perkins,You're always so busy.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,"Next week, I promise."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I'm Mark."
Ann Perkins,Sorry!
Justin,"Hey, Mark."
Ann Perkins,"Justin, this is Mark."
Ann Perkins,This is the city planner.
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Pleasure.
Justin,Pleasure.
Justin,"Anyway, Leslie, I have to go."
Justin,It has been a super pleasure meeting you.
Justin,"I am gonna get into this over the weekend, and I will get back to you on Monday about it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Justin,All right.
Tom Haverford,"See you, Justin!"
Justin,"Okay, Tom."
Justin,Good seeing you.
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again."
Ann Perkins,That's great!
Leslie Knope,"You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years."
Leslie Knope,"I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for... Five hundred years."
Ann Perkins,What is your ideal man?
Leslie Knope,He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.
Ann Perkins,Interesting.
Ann Perkins,"That's a, high weird bar."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Just off the bat, there's a couple of doctors I think you would love."
Leslie Knope,Actually I was thinkingâ¦
Leslie Knope,What about Justin?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I don't, I just don't know if that would be the right fit."
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Is there something wrong with him?
Ann Perkins,"No, no, he's really, really, really great, and you're so great, obviously."
Ann Perkins,I just... I don't... I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"It's hard, I can'tâ¦ I can't putâ¦"
Leslie Knope,What is it though?
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, it's justâ¦ I don't think it would beâ¦"
Leslie Knope,I think it would. No?
Ann Perkins,"No, I really don't."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, I don'tâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be sorry, I mean, if you think it wasn't gonna work, orâ¦"
Ann Perkins,"But I will find you someone, I promise, and he'll be awesome."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go do it right now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good, great, yes!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ann, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, just one rule."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I understand your complaint.
Ron Swanson,I have to go now.
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,Ron Solo!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tom."
Tom Haverford,I want to help you with your assistant search.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Tom Haverford,Just want to do my boy Ron a solid.
Tom Haverford,"I know exactly what you're looking for, and I will find you a reliable person."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, sounds good."
Tom Haverford,"How do you know that was a member of the public, and not just a friend?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, my friends know that I have a strict no call policy."
Ron Swanson,Now get out there and find me an assistant.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I left you three messages.
Ann Perkins,Did you get them?
Leslie Knope,"No, I've been running around all day."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Ann Perkins,"I found the perfect guy to set you up with, but he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight, so I came over here right after work."
Leslie Knope,Is that his blood?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, damn, now I have to go back."
Leslie Knope,Who is he?
Ann Perkins,"His name is Chris and he's an MRI technician, and he's really cute, and he's very passionate about his job, and I told him all about you, and he's really interested."
Ann Perkins,"So, dinner tonight, and here's the info."
Leslie Knope,Thanks!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,How's he gonna know it's me?
Leslie Knope,I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'll wear a giant red hat."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have one of those."
Leslie Knope,What should I wear?
Leslie Knope,It's gotta be red.
Ann Perkins,I will just tell him what you look like.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Are you Chris?
Chris,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Chris,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Chris,You look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chris,"Oh, here, let me take your coat."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well done, Ann."
Chris,I actually heard that.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris,"Well, I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad and grad school."
Chris,Go Badgers!
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Indiana Hoosiers!
Chris,No.
Chris,Badgers.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,I'm just glad that we could make this happen.
Chris,"Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are, and I just had to see for myself."
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's my number one best friend."
Chris,"I wish she'd told me that you went to Indiana, but whatever."
Chris,"So, you're in charge of amusement parks, right?"
Chris,"God, that's exciting!"
Leslie Knope,"Actually, it's regular parks."
Leslie Knope,Like swings and slides and stuff.
Chris,Strike two.
Leslie Knope,"You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?"
Chris,Why would you say that?
Leslie Knope,I don'tâ¦ I don't know. They're not. Forget it.
Chris,Way to go Chris. Did I just make it awkward?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, you didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, you kind of did."
Leslie Knope,"Let's just start from the beginning, I guess."
Chris,"Hey, watch this."
Chris,I will now extinguish this candle with my bare hand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris,That really hurt!
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Chris,"Oh, God!"
Chris,It looked so much easier on the Internet.
Chris,"God, I gotta borrow some of your ice!"
Chris,"Oh, no, thanks, I'm not thirsty."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,German?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"All right, later."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was that, uh, Justin?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,We are going to lunch tomorrow.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh get out. How long have you known him?
Ann Perkins,Forever. He practically saved my life.
Ann Perkins,"He was like, the only cool dude at my high school."
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you guys ever date?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,We never did.
Ann Perkins,"He's just, like, a really amazing person."
Ann Perkins,Let's do this!
Mark Brendanawicz,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Marley and Me!
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,"Puppies, puppies, puppies!"
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's watch Marley and Me.
Tom Haverford,Brian.
Tom Haverford,"Technically, you'd be assisting Ron, but Ron really doesn't do much government work, so you'd really be working for me."
Tom Haverford,"I see your resume here. Education, exellent. Awesome professional experience."
Tom Haverford,But I don't care.
Tom Haverford,I'm interested in real world expertise.
Tom Haverford,I got a nightclub opening to go to.
Tom Haverford,Which tie do I wear?
Brian,I like the one on the left.
Tom Haverford,That was a trick question.
Tom Haverford,The answer's this one.
Brian,I didn't even know that one existed.
Tom Haverford,I had high hopes wen I saw your plum V neck.
Tom Haverford,But those hopes have been dashed. You can leave.
Chris,"You ever see that movie, The Matrix?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris,99% real.
Leslie Knope,"So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?"
Chris,Great question.
Chris,Someone steps into the room.
Chris,"Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher."
Chris,"She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is."
Chris,She's scared.
Chris,"In less than an hour, I know what it is."
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with her?
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,"But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything."
Chris,See that guy over there?
Chris,Imagine being able to look inside his head.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Chris,I know.
Chris,"You could look inside this steak or you could look inside this butter or these potatoes, or this candle, or this beer, or this flower, or this bread."
Chris,You can look inside anything.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread."
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I'd have to do an MRI.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Thisâ¦ it's just bread in there.
Chris,"Yeah, but what's inside that bread? Could be cheese."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before."
Chris,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know about this.
Chris,"Well, I'm offering you a free scan."
Chris,"It usually costs up to 2,000 dollars."
Chris,I'm kind of spoiling you here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am a little curious."
Chris,Good.
Chris,"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.
Chris,Try not to smile too much. It'll affect the diagnosis.
Leslie Knope,Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.
Chris,"Sometimes smiling is read as ""AIDS."""
Chris,"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Does that matter?
Chris,"Well, not for this."
Chris,Okay.
Chris,It's gonna be a little crammed in there.
Chris,"Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass."
Tom Haverford,Scenario.
Tom Haverford,I meet a girl at a bar.
Tom Haverford,"She seems kind of into me, could go either way."
Tom Haverford,"I get her number, it's two days later, what do I text her?"
Zack,"""It was nice meeting you."""
Tom Haverford,"No, Zack!"
Tom Haverford,"I don't text her, ""It was nice meeting you."""
Tom Haverford,"I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What's cracking?"""
Tom Haverford,"Your resume's very impressive, but tell me about you."
Tom Haverford,Tell me about your friends.
Tom Haverford,Be as superficial as possible.
Tom Haverford,Just your basic assistant stuff.
Tom Haverford,"Taking messages, wakeup calls, Muscle Milk runs, condom runs, bottle service at the Snakehole Lounge, covering for me in any legally dicey situations."
Extra,Sorry.
Extra,What do I get out of this?
Tom Haverford,Connections.
Tom Haverford,"Plus 19 grand a year, minus my 10% headhunters' fee."
Extra,I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?
Tom Haverford,I have a job to offer.
Tom Haverford,"In the immortal words of Rod Blagojevich, ""It's a [bleep] valuable thing."""
Tom Haverford,"""You just don't give it away for nothing."""
Chris,"All right, Leslie. You're going to start hearing some loud noises and see some flashing lights."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris,So you never told me where you're from.
Leslie Knope,I'm from Pawnee.
Chris,"Keep still, please."
Chris,"And you said that your mom works in government, too, is that right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes she does.
Chris,"You gotta keep still. No talking, Leslie."
Chris,What kind of music do you like?
Leslie Knope,Can I answer that?
Chris,Sure.
Chris,Keep still.
Leslie Knope,All kinds.
Chris,"Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie."
Chris,I've told you that a thousand times.
Chris,Did you ever break your arm?
Chris,You can answer that.
Chris,"Here, I'll turn it off."
Leslie Knope,"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control."
Leslie Knope,I'm surprised you can see that.
Leslie Knope,"It was, like, three years ago."
Chris,I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.
Chris,"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Chris,You've got a great oven.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time to go."
Chris,You got ample room in there.
Chris,"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie."
Chris,"You got a big, industrial-sized oven."
Leslie Knope,"So we're done, right?"
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,How's the date going?
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,We just finished the MRI.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend."
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not offended at all. I don't know him that well."
Leslie Knope,Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?
Ann Perkins,"Well, he seemed great."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Les."
Ann Perkins,"I'll find you somebody else, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Just don't let this sour you on dating.
Ann Perkins,"Like, what you're doing is really healthy, so keep the faith, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Chris,Hey!
Chris,No cell phones!
Chris,Don't touch that.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Chris,Just take your hands off it.
Mark Brendanawicz,What was that about?
Ann Perkins,I set Leslie up on a date.
Ann Perkins,I don't think it's going that well.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,With Justin?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,This guy I know from the hospital.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why wouldn't you set her up with Justin?
Ann Perkins,I don't really see them together.
Ann Perkins,You know?
Ann Perkins,"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.
Ann Perkins,Why are we talking about this?
Mark Brendanawicz,We're not.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Chris,Well it actually all looks pretty good.
Chris,You've got a large brain.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chris,Yeah.
Chris,"Well, it looks pretty... Hang on."
Chris,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What's weird?
Chris,Your brain.
Chris,See that shadow right there?
Chris,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Is that bad?
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Chris,"Oh, wait."
Chris,Oh.
Chris,"It's, like, a smudge or something."
Chris,We almost wheeled you out of here on a chair.
Leslie Knope,Should we go?
Chris,"Yeah, we should go."
Chris,Can you imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life sipping a steak through a straw?
Chris,That almost happened to you. You were a smudge away.
Chris,Thank God I was here.
Chris,Looks like we make a pretty good team.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him."
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's why you didn't set Leslie up.
Mark Brendanawicz,Because you're saving him.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, you are."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,"You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day..."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"If I'm late for dinner one night, you're gonna dump me for Dustin?"
Ann Perkins,"No, no. Justin."
Mark Brendanawicz,Justin?
Ann Perkins,"Absolutely not, but if we break up or you die tragically in a city planning accident and I wait a respectful amount of time, I don't know. Maybeâ¦"
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.
Mark Brendanawicz,Even I know that.
Chris,"So, did you want to go back to your place?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date."
Chris,I get it.
Chris,"Get your MRI and get out, huh?"
Leslie Knope,This was your idea.
Chris,Clever lady.
Chris,I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.
Chris,I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Chris,"Goodbye, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I drove us here.
Leslie Knope,Goodie.
Chris,"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?"
Tom Haverford,"So, how was the big date?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer."
Leslie Knope,The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,That sounds hot.
Leslie Knope,I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, you slept together?"
Leslie Knope,"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?"
Justin,This a bad time?
Leslie Knope,"No, come on in."
Tom Haverford,Justin!
Justin,"What's up, brother?"
Leslie Knope,Should weâ¦?
Justin,"Yeah, let's do."
Tom Haverford,See you dude.
Justin,"See you around, brother."
Tom Haverford,Dope pea coat.
Tom Haverford,I have the same one in an extra small.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, well, well. Look who's bothering who now?"
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the shot is on the other foot.
Andy Dwyer,And the guuy who polishes shoes is now me.
Andy Dwyer,What up? What can I do for ya?
Mark Brendanawicz,"When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,I hate Justin.
Andy Dwyer,Ann was so obviously into him.
Andy Dwyer,It was so annoying.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Andy Dwyer,"I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance."
Mark Brendanawicz,Do me a favor.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.
Andy Dwyer,Will do.
Andy Dwyer,Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Andy Dwyer,What you're doing to Mark is not cool.
Ann Perkins,Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it.
Ann Perkins,I'm not getting into this with you.
April Ludgate,You did something wrong?
Ann Perkins,No! I didn't do anything wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Come here.
Ann Perkins,This is none of your business.
Ann Perkins,You don't know what you're talking about.
Andy Dwyer,"Actually, I do know what I'm talking about."
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?"
Ann Perkins,Didn't you just explain why?
Andy Dwyer,I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.
Andy Dwyer,"Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important."
Andy Dwyer,That was rough.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I didn't know that."
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left."
Andy Dwyer,"But you do know now, so you have to choose."
Andy Dwyer,It's either me or Justin.
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna choose.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,I'm dating Mark!
Andy Dwyer,"Are you, though?"
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Ah! That close.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,"""Cease and desist."""
Leslie Knope,"""Burden of proof."""
Leslie Knope,Very forceful language. I'm a little scared.
Justin,Check out paragraph two.
Justin,I drop the F bomb.
Leslie Knope,"""Frivolous."""
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Justin,"Definitely have the city attorney look at that, but that should be enough to do the trick."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Justin, I just... I can't thank you enough."
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,I would love... Mmmhmm.
Justin,I'll see you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Justin,Bye.
Donna Meagle,Damn!
Donna Meagle,He is all right.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you hit that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it."
Donna Meagle,Maybe she's got him on hold.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,"Ronald, I've done it."
Tom Haverford,"I've found your assistant, and he's dope."
Tom Haverford,His name is Jean-Ralphio.
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Big T.
Tom Haverford,What up?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Mr. Swanson, two things."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"One, it is an absolute honor to meet you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Two, who is that hot intern chick out there? Because honestly, damn!"
Ron Swanson,Take a seat.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Right.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Here we go.
Ron Swanson,"So, Jean-Ralphioâ¦"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You got him right here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Leave a message after the beep.
Ron Swanson,Why do I want you as my assistant?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"For starters, access to the illest clubs."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And that's just for starters.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I will work for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll be on you 24/ 7.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll be like your family.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm here when you get here in the morning.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Don't worry, it's not gay."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do we have questions?
Tom Haverford,"I think our only question is, when can you start?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Right now, let's do it!"
Ron Swanson,Thank you for coming in.
Ron Swanson,We will talk.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Cool.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I feel good about this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"And, you know, you can hit me up on Facebook anytime, day or night."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You know that, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Take care, buddy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Boom.
Tom Haverford,So what do you think of your new assistant?
Ron Swanson,I want to punch you in the face so bad right now.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Message received.
Tom Haverford,I'll keep looking.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Bring me the opposite of him.
April Ludgate,Tell me what Ann did wrong. Please. I need to know.
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing, it's none of my business."
Extra,What kind of music is this?
Andy Dwyer,"It's rock and roll, my friend."
Andy Dwyer,The kind that sticks in your brain.
Andy Dwyer,"Loud, fast, smooth, handsome rock."
April Ludgate,That band is really blowing up right now.
April Ludgate,They're number one on iTunes.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,I'll take one.
Andy Dwyer,You are amazing! I like when you hang out here.
April Ludgate,I want to be your assistant.
Ron Swanson,Really? You hate it here.
April Ludgate,So do you.
April Ludgate,I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.
April Ludgate,"If anyone comes to see you, I'll scare them away."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, April, if you had to choose between these two ties--"
Ron Swanson,You're hired.
April Ludgate,I just figured I might as well get paid for being here.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey! I was just calling you.
Ann Perkins,Here.
Leslie Knope,This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins,I'm so out of sorts.
Ann Perkins,Here.
Leslie Knope,Porter's Grill at 7:00.
Ann Perkins,Justin's gonna meet you there.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk.
Ann Perkins,You deserve way better than that.
Leslie Knope,If this situation is weird or if you feel weird--
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins,You guys will really like each other.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,I gotta run.
Ann Perkins,I have another stop on the pride swallowing tour of City Hall.
Leslie Knope,Go get him.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's where I never find things.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"So, I just set up Justin and Leslie."
Ann Perkins,And I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,"I rented District 9, if you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Dark ending, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him."
Leslie Knope,"No, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R- A- P about local government."
Leslie Knope,"Now, she's our newest employee."
Leslie Knope,To April!
All,Cheers! Cheers!
April Ludgate,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, come and celebrate!"
Jerry Gergich,"No, thanks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, everybody, let's get back to work."
April Ludgate,Where are you going?
Jerry Gergich,I want to talk to Ron about the size of my desk.
April Ludgate,"Jerry, you have to schedule an appointment."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,How about now?
April Ludgate,Ron's not here.
Jerry Gergich,He's right there.
Jerry Gergich,I can see him.
April Ludgate,I'll let you know when he's available.
Ron Swanson,Attagirl.
