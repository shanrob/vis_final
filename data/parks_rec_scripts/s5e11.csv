Paula Horke,"Well it's a pleasure to be here, ladies."
Paula Horke,I didn't think anybody really cared about my time on the city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we do."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you are such an inspiration."
Leslie Knope,Still going strong at 82.
April Ludgate,How old is that handkerchief?
Paula Horke,"Well, it's not a handkerchief."
Paula Horke,It's a receipt.
Leslie Knope,Paula Horke was Pawnee's first female city councilor a huge inspiration to me.
Leslie Knope,"Women have come a long way in Pawnee, but we still have quite a ways to go."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, technically, I'm not allowed to reserve this conference room without my husband or father's signature."
Paula Horke,Government was a real boys' club back in the '70s.
Paula Horke,"They smoked their cigars, they snapped my bra, wore mirrors on their shoes to look up my skirt."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am happy to report that it is now a pervert free people's club."
Ann Perkins,"Well, except for Councilman Dexhart, who's a selfdescribed pervert."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, and didn't Milton try to kiss you?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, things aren't perfect."
Paula Horke,All the other councilmen used to keep a calendar of my menstrual cycle.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,That is horrible.
Leslie Knope,They don't do that to me.
Leslie Knope,Do they do that to me?
Paula Horke,"I once tried to start a commission to try to get more jobs for women in city government, and they dismissed me, saying that it was because it was just my time of the month."
Paula Horke,"Admittedly, they were right."
Paula Horke,Because of the calendar.
Leslie Knope,Man pigs.
Leslie Knope,All of them.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough."
April Ludgate,"You know what, I think men are better than women."
Leslie Knope,She's kidding.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,"They provide for us, and we must obey them because they are our masters."
Leslie Knope,"April, stop it."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, you'll never land a beau with that domineering tone."
April Ludgate,We must always walk behind the men.
Leslie Knope,She ugh.
Zoe Lewis,Moustache!
Ivy Lewis,Dumb dumb!
Zoe Lewis,Moustache!
Ivy Lewis,Dumb dumb!
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ann Perkins,I just came to drop off some of the employee What is happening?
Ron Swanson,"The girls are on break, and their sitter had to go out of town for the day, so I'm watching them while Diane works."
Ron Swanson,I borrowed some markers from Leslie and some stickers from Leslie and a LiteBrite which I got from Andy.
Ron Swanson,"Girls, this is Ann."
Ron Swanson,Talk to Ann.
Ron Swanson,She's terrific.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, dudettes."

Jerry Gergich,"You're Well, hey, girls."
Ivy Lewis,No.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,An equal gender employment commission.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I don't think this is a good idea."
Chris Traeger,I think it's a fantastic idea.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know where you were going with that.
Chris Traeger,The lack of women in this government is criminal.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna ask each department to send two people to a meeting today.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,And!
Chris Traeger,Andand I can ask Shauna MalwaeTweep to write an article about it for the Pawnee Journal.
Chris Traeger,She's my special friend.
Leslie Knope,That's what you're calling her now.
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to call her.
Chris Traeger,I don't entirely understand the behavior of young people.
Chris Traeger,"Recently, we engaged in something called a ""group hang."""
Chris Traeger,"It was like a date, but there were seven other people there."
Chris Traeger,It was very confusing.
Chris Traeger,I'm not really sure what our label is.
Chris Traeger,"Labels can be bad, but they can also be good."
Chris Traeger,"""Warning: Toxic bleach"" is a good label."
Chris Traeger,Shauna MalwaeTweep has amazing dimples.
Leslie Knope,So the commission?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right, the commission."
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna get that going right now.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know this text you sent me was a lie and Michael Stipe is not actually here, correct?"
Tom Haverford,Correct.
Tom Haverford,That was a lie.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I knew it was."
Ben Wyatt,I just couldn't live with myself if it had been true.
Tom Haverford,And that's why I sent it.
Andy Dwyer,Where's free Skittles?
Tom Haverford,"Here you go, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,He gets his thing?
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I need you two to teach me everything you know about basketball."
Tom Haverford,RentASwag is doing really well.
Tom Haverford,I'm on track to turn a profit in my third month.
Tom Haverford,One problem: All the kids that shop in the store are basketball crazy.
Tom Haverford,It's all they talk about.
Tom Haverford,"I need to be able to schmooze them, and I can't keep referring to basketball players as ""Khloe Kardashian's husband and his friends."""
Tom Haverford,You're just the men to help me out.
Tom Haverford,"One jock, one geek who loves stats."
Tom Haverford,I'll give you a few minutes to cancel the rest of your plans for the day.
Andy Dwyer,No need.
Andy Dwyer,My only plan was to buy Skittles.
April Ludgate,"Wow, Chris."
April Ludgate,Your gender equality commission is a real sausage fest.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding me.
Chris Traeger,I just assumed that some of the departments would send women.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I am part of the problem.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Did anyone notice that there are no women on the Gender Equality Commission?
Councilman Milton,"Oh, there's a lady right next to you."
Councilman Milton,"Oh, wait, no."
Councilman Milton,It's just a very beautiful man.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, okay, we are gonna need to rebalance this commission."
Councilman Milton,"Listen, you did a great job setting it up and getting the snacks ready, but we'll take it from here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Councilman Milton, I did put the snacks together, and they are delicious, I must say, but that is not the point."
Councilman Milton,Round of applause for the girl.
Councilman Milton,She has to leave to get more snacks.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,This is my commission!
Councilman Milton,Ouch.
Councilman Milton,Why so ornery?
Councilman Milton,It's not the 7th yet.
Ron Swanson,Hm.
Ivy Lewis,Your shoes are red now.
Zoe Lewis,Yay.
Ron Swanson,Hooray.
Diane Lewis,Hey!
Ivy Lewis,Mommy!
Diane Lewis,"You survived, huh?"
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I did."
Diane Lewis,How were they?
Diane Lewis,Really?
Ron Swanson,Couldn't have been better.
Ron Swanson,We had a wonderful time.
Diane Lewis,"Well, that's good."
Diane Lewis,"'Cause my sitter's still out of town, so I really hate to ask you this, but is there any way you could take them again tomorrow?"
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,I'd be delighted.
Diane Lewis,You're a lifesaver.
Diane Lewis,Thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Girls, you wanna spend another day with Ron?"
Zoe Lewis,Yeah!
Councilman Milton,I believe one problem with hiring women is that they're frail and breakable.
Leslie Knope,Is it possible you're thinking about light bulbs?
Leslie Knope,Or your hip?
April Ludgate,Mm.
April Ludgate,"If I were 300 years older, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"Incoherent ramblings aside, I've done some research, and the female employment rate in government is abysmal."
Leslie Knope,The number one offender: Sanitation.
Extra,All right!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, stop celebrating."
Leslie Knope,"Why are there no female garbage collectors, Steve?"
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,We hire women for other things.
Leslie Knope,"You have one woman, and she's a secretary."
Extra,"And she's the best secretary we got, except for Dan."
Extra,Dan's awesome.
Extra,Dan.
Leslie Knope,"Garbage collectors make good wages, they have good benefits, and they are the smelly glue that keeps this city together."
Leslie Knope,You need to hire more women.
Dewey,"Not that many women apply, plus it's a very physically demanding job."
Dewey,Your average woman can't handle it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I took extensive notes on ways to maximize our efficiency, because we can't be just as good as the men."
Leslie Knope,We have to be better.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're totally right."
April Ludgate,Let's rock this.
Leslie Knope,"April, I love you, but I don't need your sarcasm right now."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Let's get rolling.
April Ludgate,I wanna get into some garbage.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I love garbage.
April Ludgate,You ever found a dead body in the trash?
April Ludgate,Or body parts?
April Ludgate,"Like, a torso or a head?"
April Ludgate,Please say head.
Extra,"Hey, Dewey."
Extra,Leslie brought binders.
Dewey,What do they say?
Dewey,"""Pick up garbage."
Dewey,"Put in truck""?"
Leslie Knope,"Actually, yeah."
Leslie Knope,That's what's in the binder on every page because I believe in being thorough.
Dewey,All right.
Dewey,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Let's do it, trash people!"
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,Let's feed the beast!
Ron Swanson,Here you are.
Ron Swanson,I had to search the directory for quite a while.
Ron Swanson,I thought your last name was Hanson for some reason.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Always has been.
Ron Swanson,You seem more like a Hanson.
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, I have the girls again today, and they're asking to play with you."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,I thought they hated me.
Ron Swanson,"No, the opposite."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what you did to 'em, but it worked like gangbusters."
Ann Perkins,"Or they do hate me, and you're just desperate and tired."
Ron Swanson,"Either way, can you help me?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm out of activities, and they're playing with my land mine."
Zoe Lewis,This thing's cool.
Zoe Lewis,What are these things?
Chris Traeger,Let's play a word association game.
Chris Traeger,"I'll say a word, and then you say the first thing that pops into your mind."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.

Leslie Knope,Oh!
Chris Traeger,"According to Leslie's binder, she and April are making even better time than the guys do on a normal day."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's weird."
Leslie Knope,"You know, with us being women and all, you'd think our boobs would get in the way."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is that accurate Mr. Phlegner?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is Councilwoman Knope ahead of the regular schedule for this route?
Extra,Whatever.
Extra,No comment.
Leslie Knope,Tough stuff.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you posing?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't have a photographer with me.
Leslie Knope,Google Earth Always taking pics.

Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's start with the basics."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, why don't you just play some oneonone, see if you can score?"
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, guard him."
Tom Haverford,"Eh, he's too big."
Tom Haverford,I can't see over him.
Tom Haverford,It's not fair.
Tom Haverford,I feel like everyone should be the same size.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to create space."
Ben Wyatt,You gotta just dribble around him.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Tom Haverford,Now what?
Ben Wyatt,Shoot!

Ron Swanson,"What is wrong with you, woman?"
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,I thought kids liked ghost stories.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, girls!"
Ann Perkins,Did you wanna look through my nurse kit?
Zoe Lewis,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, check it out, bandages!"
Ann Perkins,"We can wrap up the dolls, and pretend they just had surgery."

Ann Perkins,"Here, Zoe, watch."
Ivy Lewis,Do me!

Ann Perkins,"You know what, Ron?"
Ann Perkins,"I can watch them for a little while, if you wanna Take a break."
April Ludgate,This is Stacy Knoblauch's house.
April Ludgate,"I went to high school with her, and she was super mean to me, and now I know that she dyes her hair."
April Ludgate,I knew that wench wasn't naturally blonde.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,She has to use prescription strength deodorant.
April Ludgate,This is the best day of my life.
Extra,"Hey, ladies, someone just called in a pickup."
Extra,We have to make an unscheduled stop.
Extra,Hope you can handle it.
Extra,It's not in the binders.

April Ludgate,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Nothin' but net.

Tom Haverford,Let's do this.

Ben Wyatt,This could really only go poorly.
Tom Haverford,He won't get out of my way!
Ben Wyatt,"Tom Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,I'm pivoting.
Tom Haverford,Ben told me to pivot.
Ben Wyatt,"I told you you can pivot, not that you can only pivot."
Ben Wyatt,Stop pivoting!
Tom Haverford,"All right, that's illegal."
Tom Haverford,"I may not know much, but you can't just steal the ball from another player."
Extra,"Hey, aren't you the guy who owns RentASwag?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Extra,"You suck at basketball, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you suck at being polite, sir."
Extra,"This has been fun, but we have an actual game tomorrow against guys who can actually play."
Extra,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer for the dunk!
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that wall's so close."
Ann Perkins,"Doctors, the operation is now complete."

Ann Perkins,This is the most fun I have ever had with kids.
Ann Perkins,They even said they wanted to be doctors when they grow up.
Ann Perkins,Hot tip for you babysitters out there.
Ann Perkins,Let your kids play with medical tools all the time.
Ron Swanson,We have a problem.

Jerry Gergich,"Well, it's gotta be one of these, right?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,"Ladies, no, no, no, no, no!"
Zoe Lewis,The patient needs a haircut.

Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, move it."
Leslie Knope,"On four, five, six, here we go!"
Extra,You need a hand?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we don't need a hand."
Leslie Knope,"What, you think Joan of Arc needed a hand?"
April Ludgate,Doing what?
Leslie Knope,Let me tell you something.
Leslie Knope,"We are not leaving until this symbolic feminist obstacle is loaded onto that truck of women's advancement, and you can put that on the record, Shauna."
Extra,"Well, you ladies clearly have everything in hand."
Extra,Dewey and I are gonna head back to base.
Extra,Hope we didn't throw you off schedule.
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Extra,Have fun!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Shauna, maybe not put this part on the record."
Leslie Knope,"You know, leave the earlier part on the record, but if we can't get this fridge onto the truck then maybe not put that on the record, and then just destroy the record altogether."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, guys, I'm gonna go ahead and decide what's on and off the record on my own."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cool?
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,The whole city is watching.
Leslie Knope,"If I can't move that fridge onto that truck, then feminism is over in this town."
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I thought sneaking up on it would work.
Jerry Gergich,This is the one.
Jerry Gergich,This is
Ron Swanson,Oh! Why do you have so many keys?
Zoe Lewis,We did surgery just like you taught us!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you girls clean up all this hair, and I'm gonna talk to Ron."
Ivy Lewis,Let's cut off our toes!
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna take this bag, too."
Ron Swanson,You need to fix this.
Ann Perkins,It's not that bad.
Ann Perkins,Nobody got hurt.
Ron Swanson,"It's extremely bad! I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening."
Ann Perkins,What? Did you just say you love Diane?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I did not.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did! That is so cute!"
Ron Swanson,"For God's sake, Hanson, will you please focus on the larger problem?"
Zoe Lewis,Ron loves Mommy!
Ivy Lewis,Ron loves Mommy!
Ron Swanson,"Girls, girls, I don't know what you think you heard, but please don't tell your mother what you incorrectly think you heard."
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ron Swanson,I love nothing!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna have to start writing this up soon.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Kinda sucks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I thought maybe we'd be done in time to grab a drink.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Have you been to Bistro d'Amour? It's really romantic.
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, it was just gonna be you and me, my sister, a few people from work, and my ex-boyfriend."
Chris Traeger,That's really confusing.
Chris Traeger,I have a request.
Chris Traeger,Could you please make sure that my involvement in this stays off the record? I wouldn't want anyone thinking that you're biased because we're something.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You don't have to worry about that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna include a disclaimer describing the nature of our relationship.
Chris Traeger,I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper to find out our status.
Chris Traeger,Why did I have to fall for somebody from the old media?
April Ludgate,Maybe we should just eat the refrigerator.
April Ludgate,"We start chewing now, we can finish before the sun comes up."
Leslie Knope,"We have to solve this problem, or they are going to point to this forever as a reason to not hire women."
Leslie Knope,I should never have taken the bait.
Leslie Knope,"It was just such tasty, righteously flavored bait."
Extra,You here to move the fridge?
April Ludgate,Are you a ghost?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are."
Extra,Why you think you can lift it? You are two little canaries.
Extra,Those garbagemen couldn't even lift it.
Extra,They are like giant bears.
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Extra,"Bears are bigger than canaries, yes? So if bears can't lift the"
Leslie Knope,"No, I understand animal sizes."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
Extra,"They tried three days ago, and it does not budge."
Extra,"They say they're gonna come back with more guys, but they come back with canaries."
Extra,"Fly away, little canaries."
Leslie Knope,Those Sanitation goons set us up.
Leslie Knope,You know what? Let's just go.
April Ludgate,What? No! We can't let them beat us.
Leslie Knope,Just call it a tie.
Leslie Knope,Nobody can lift it.
April Ludgate,"No, Leslie, we do not want to tie."
April Ludgate,We want to win.
April Ludgate,"Those guys suck, okay? We have to prove them wrong."
April Ludgate,"Look, all we have to do is get some PCP."
April Ludgate,You can move anything on angel dust.
April Ludgate,"My cousin Hesen, he beat off five cops on that stuff."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,Sir! Does this refrigerator still work?
Extra,Works okay.
Extra,We got a new one.
Extra,We don't need it.
Andy Dwyer,So what if those kids think you're the lamest guy in the world?
Andy Dwyer,"That's not who you want shopping at RentASwag anyways, Tom."
Tom Haverford,That's exactly who I want shopping at RentASwag.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, well, then, that sucks."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I wanna show you something."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook after a bad loss."
Ben Wyatt,"Even the greats get beat, but they get back out there the next day, and they fight."
Ben Wyatt,So let's hit the gym again tomorrow.
Tom Haverford,"Guys, I think I just dribbled up an idea."
Tom Haverford,"No, double dribbled it."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you have learned nothing about basketball."
Andy Dwyer,"You're a good friend, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thanks."
Andy Dwyer,Can I borrow 1500 dollars? You're not allowed to ask what it's for.
Andy Dwyer,Fireworks.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, everyone is fine."
Ron Swanson,"No one got hurt, but there was an incident."
Diane Lewis,"Oh, my God."
Diane Lewis,What happened?
Ann Perkins,"Diane, this is all my fault."
Ann Perkins,I let them go into my nurse's bag.
Diane Lewis,"Well, who has been having fun with scissors?"
Ivy Lewis,Us! Ann taught us how to be doctors!
Diane Lewis,Yay!
Ron Swanson,You're not mad?
Diane Lewis,"No, it's fine."
Diane Lewis,They're kids.
Diane Lewis,"Once, Zoe put Ivy in the dryer, so"
Ron Swanson,I'm still incredibly sorry.
Ron Swanson,I feel like I let you down.
Diane Lewis,It is so sweet to me how much you care.
Diane Lewis,This is why I love you.
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I love you, too."
Ann Perkins,That's my cue.
Ann Perkins,"All right, girls, good hang."
Ivy Lewis,"Bye, Ann!"
Zoe Lewis,"Thanks, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Leslie! Shauna just sent me the disclaimer that she's gonna use before she prints the article."
Chris Traeger,"""City manager Chris Traeger was present for this event, and has a personal relationship with the author."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's pretty good, right? ""Personal relationship."""
Chris Traeger,It's not romantic.
Chris Traeger,But it is descriptive.
Chris Traeger,"No, it's not even descriptive."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're not used to this, but maybe you should just try to keep it chill and see what happens."
Chris Traeger,Great advice.
Chris Traeger,"Impossible to follow, but great advice."
Leslie Knope,"So do you think the soup kitchen could use that fridge? I mean, April and I were gonna haul it onto the truck effortlessly, but if you need it"
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra,This is a godsend.
Extra,Thank you for thinking of us.
Extra,"Grab a side, ladies."
Extra,I think all of us can get it on the truck.
Leslie Knope,"Not only did we complete the garbage route and move an unmovable fridge, but the Sanitation department hired three new female trash haulers."
Leslie Knope,"And, best of all, April gave me this present to commemorate our feminist victory."
Leslie Knope,And it's trash.
Leslie Knope,It's filled with trash.
Leslie Knope,Maybe there's something on the bottom here.
Leslie Knope,"Let me see, No, just trash."
Extra,This is Brandon Turnbill for Kids' 46 News.
Extra,"I'm here with the star of today's win, Josh Diamond."
Extra,"What was the key to the victory, Josh?"
Extra,"Well, uh, everything just came together for us, and we came out on top, and we're gonna try to keep it going next week against Snerling."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, tiny reporter."
Tom Haverford,"It was a huge win for Josh and the boys, and after a huge win, be sure to visit RentASwag on Durham Avenue for all your postgame press conference fashion rental needs."
Tom Haverford,"We've got everything: Dope suits, pocket squares, Gingham shirts, glasses with no lenses, Tiny cardigans, Fedoras Look at this watch! Whatever swag you need, You can rent at RentASwag."
Tom Haverford,"Now, that's basketball."
