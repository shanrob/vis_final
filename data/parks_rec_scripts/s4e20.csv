Character,Line
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, everybody, latest poll is Newport, 40%, Leslie, 32%, with everyone else way back."
Ben Wyatt,Now this debate is our best chance to close that gap.
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys will be talking to reporters, providing facts, general spin."
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,This is the best possible job for me.
Chris Traeger,I can literally make anything sound positive.
Tom Haverford,"Your house just burned down, and you lost all your money in the stock market."
Chris Traeger,It's a chance to start over.
Chris Traeger,"Fire is cleansing, and true wealth is measured by the amount of love in your life."
Chris Traeger,"If I had to have anybody tell me that I had cancer, I would want it to be me."
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, April, and Andy, you'll be throwing a party for our biggest donors."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I can't believe our house is going to be full of rich people named Dottie and Todd and Rick."
Leslie Knope,Is the menu all set?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will be providing several slabs of my world famous Swanson ribs."
April Ludgate,And I will be providing my world famous $100 lap dances.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet!
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,The election is in two weeks.
Ben Wyatt,The debate is in nine hours.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get to work.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Can't believe we're doing this here.
Leslie Knope,"Seats, like, 800 people."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's what you get when your opponent's the most famous person in town."
Leslie Knope,This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Ben Wyatt,4 feet. Exact same size as the podium you use in the Parks department.
Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Ben Wyatt,You got this.
Leslie Knope,I got this.
Ben Wyatt,You could debate Newport in your sleep.
Leslie Knope,I have.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,We sleep in the same bed.
Ben Wyatt,It's been hell.
Leslie Knope,I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
Leslie Knope,What if the town loves Bobby more than me?
Ben Wyatt,There's no way.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to destroy him.
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to rip out his spine with your teeth and then chew it up and gargle with it.
Leslie Knope,I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
April Ludgate,"I'm trying to clean up for the party, but I swear to God, my arms can't move that way."
Tom Haverford,Leave it messy.
Tom Haverford,It doesn't matter.
Tom Haverford,Nothing matters.
Tom Haverford,Life is garbage.
April Ludgate,What happened?
Tom Haverford,Ann broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,For reals this time.
Tom Haverford,And all I did was call into this radio station and give her a sweet little shoutout.
Tom Haverford,So we're up in the club.
Tom Haverford,It's me!
Tom Haverford,We're dancing.
Tom Haverford,We're sweating.
Tom Haverford,Let's just say we got to second that night.
Tom Haverford,Kind of.
Extra,Me so horny.
Tom Haverford,This chick's name is Ann Perkins.
Tom Haverford,Look her up on the government website.
Tom Haverford,She is crazy hot.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that great?
Tom Haverford,Come here.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,I complimented you.
Tom Haverford,I guess she's just afraid of how powerful her feelings are.
April Ludgate,"Dude, that's not why she broke up with you."
April Ludgate,You have to stop your stupid swagger and just tell her in a normal voice that you care about her.
Tom Haverford,What do you know?
Tom Haverford,You don't care about things.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I do, I care about Andy And champion."
April Ludgate,"And I want Leslie to win, and I like sleeping."
April Ludgate,So everybody has things they care about.
April Ludgate,"If Ann is yours, you need to tell her."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Chris, hypothetical crisis."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie just tried to answer a question and audibly farted then threw up.
Ben Wyatt,Spin.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope is literally overflowing with ideas for this town.
Chris Traeger,"And speaking of methane, have you heard about her plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions?"
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Nice.
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,Ann and I make such a great team.
Chris Traeger,It's silly that we're not a team in real life.
Chris Traeger,"I just heard those words come out of my mouth, and I have made a decision."
Chris Traeger,I've heard that you and Tom Haverford are no longer romantically involved.
Chris Traeger,Is that true?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we broke up."
Ann Perkins,And I honestly can't believe we ever dated.
Chris Traeger,Does defy logic.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, I still have feelings for you."
Chris Traeger,Strong feelings.
Chris Traeger,"Emotional, primal feelings."
Chris Traeger,And I would like to give our relationship another try.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we dated for, like, three months a year ago."
Ann Perkins,I honestly think that you've built this into something that it wasn't.
Ann Perkins,"And according to your rule, we can't date because you're my boss."
Chris Traeger,Maybe not for long.
Chris Traeger,"If Newport wins, the city council may replace me."
Chris Traeger,But it would open it up for us to be together.
Chris Traeger,Would you like that?
Chris Traeger,Don't answer.
Chris Traeger,Just think about it.
Chris Traeger,Come on.
Chris Traeger,Let's spin.
Extra,So you do a lot of investing?
Andy Dwyer,We like to dabble.
April Ludgate,Mmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,I recently invested in some shirts I got at a garage sale.
Andy Dwyer,Left those at Wendy's on the way home.
Andy Dwyer,So The economy.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,You are here because you gave us money.
Ron Swanson,Now we will give you ribs.

Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I've worked my whole life to make it great.
Leslie Knope,I believe I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I have the best campaign manager in the world.
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't say that.
Ben Wyatt,Jen's a killer.
Ben Wyatt,You can beat Newport.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know if I can beat her.
Leslie Knope,Here's what I know.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I like you."
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, and I like you."
Extra,And the home of the brave
Ben Wyatt,Your boy looks a little lost out there.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, he'll be fine."
Jennifer Barkley,Expectations are crazy low.
Jennifer Barkley,"If he puts two sentences together without crying, the press is going to say he's doing surprisingly well, and if he falls to pieces, he's going to look sympathetic."
Jennifer Barkley,It's a win win.
Jennifer Barkley,So do you have any idea how long this is going to take?
Perd Hapley,"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the event we are doing tonight, which is a city council candidate debate that we're going to start now."
Perd Hapley,I'm Perd Hapley.
Joan Callamezzo,"And I am legendary newswoman Joan Callamezzo, newly single."
Joan Callamezzo,It's time for opening statements.
Fester Trim,I am Fester Trim.
Fester Trim,Many of you know me as the man who sells you your guns at the gunbelievable Gun Emporium.
Extra,Whoo!
Fester Trim,I want to tell you about my idea for assault rifle vending machines.
Brandi Maxxxx,"You might be thinking, ""what does an adult film star know about politics?"
Brandi Maxxxx,""" Well, I've produced and starred in over 400 adult films this year alone."
Extra,Whoo!
Brandi Maxxxx,Thank you.
Brandi Maxxxx,"And just like Leslie, I know what it's like to be the only woman in a room full of men."
Manrico Della Rossa,I am Manrico Della Rossa.
Manrico Della Rossa,I believe animals are as important as people.
Manrico Della Rossa,"And if elected, I will fight for them as if they are my own children."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
Bobby Newport,That that hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,Hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,You're supposed to be this positive person.
Bobby Newport,Can't we just talk about things we like?
Joan Callamezzo,Well said.
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, just a reminder to our candidates to keep it civil."
Joan Callamezzo,"Looking at you, Leslie."
Bobby Newport,"Ah, that's okay, Joan."
Bobby Newport,I'm okay.
Bobby Newport,"I'm just I'm nervous, man."
Bobby Newport,I'm nervous.
Bobby Newport,Gah.
Bobby Newport,"I guess I want to do a good job because, um, I like it when people think I do a good job."
Bobby Newport,And I want your vote because I want Pawnee and my dad to see what I'm made of.
Bobby Newport,So let's do this.
Bobby Newport,The wrecking crew.
Bobby Newport,Who let you guys in?
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Jason."
Ben Wyatt,Ease back.
Joan Callamezzo,"This question about public safety comes from Twitter because apparently, that's something that happens now."
Joan Callamezzo,"@munchmeat2015 asks, ""Pawnee used 2 b safe."
Joan Callamezzo,"""Some1 stole my car."
Joan Callamezzo,"""What will u do ""2 make Pawnee safe & can u help me find my car?"
Fester Trim,""" I can assure you, if you had a gun mounted on the dashboard, which automatically shot people trying to break into it, you would still have your car."
Bobby Newport,"You know, I guess I would like to tell Mr."
Bobby Newport,Munchmeat that I think that stinks that happened to him.
Bobby Newport,"You know, one time a guy stole some downhill skis out of my jeep."
Bobby Newport,"And I was so mad, I punched a mailbox."
Bobby Newport,"I'm against crime, and I'm not ashamed to admit it."
April Ludgate,I can't get through to the cable company.
April Ludgate,Can you do something?
Ron Swanson,Like what?
April Ludgate,Anything.
April Ludgate,Andy's just acting out scenes from his favorite movies.
Andy Dwyer,"So Swayze runs, boom!"
Andy Dwyer,Tackles the guy off the motorcycle.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude's like, ""you're dead, bro!"
Andy Dwyer,""" Comes at him."
Andy Dwyer,"Swayze ducks, scissor kick."
Andy Dwyer,Sha!
Andy Dwyer,The guy has Swayze's head.
Andy Dwyer,"And he says, ""I used to [Bleep] guys like you in prison."
Andy Dwyer,""" By the looks of this guy, this is not consensual sex we're talking about."
Andy Dwyer,We see bad guy had a gun the whole time.
Andy Dwyer,"He's like, ""I'ma kill you the oldfashioned way."
Andy Dwyer,""" Swayze's like, ""not this time."
Andy Dwyer,""" That's subtext."
Andy Dwyer,He doesn't say that.
Andy Dwyer,"Bypasses the gun, hooks the arm."
Andy Dwyer,"Back to the secret move he used before to kill somebody, he feels so bad about it."
Andy Dwyer,But this time he has to do it because it's selfdefense.
Andy Dwyer,Kkkkah!
Andy Dwyer,Takes the esophagus out of the neck area.
Andy Dwyer,You can't eat.
Andy Dwyer,You'll starve to death.
Andy Dwyer,And that is Road House.
Andy Dwyer,What should I do next?
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope.
Joan Callamezzo,This question is about Pawnee's park system.
Joan Callamezzo,Why is Ramsett Park so filthy and awful?
Leslie Knope,It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
Perd Hapley,You have 20 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, okay."
Leslie Knope,I will say that the parks in Pawnee
Perd Hapley,"I do have an update on your time allotment, and that update is that your time is almost gone."
Leslie Knope,I have no more time left?
Perd Hapley,"Well, you had some time when I started talking, but by the time I finished, your time was up."
Perd Hapley,Thank you very much.
Jennifer Barkley,She's off her game.
Ben Wyatt,She's fine.
Joan Callamezzo,"Mr. Newport, rebuttal."
Bobby Newport,I know this.
Bobby Newport,"If something is dirty, we should clean it up."
Bobby Newport,Let's start there.
Bobby Newport,Right?
Bobby Newport,"You know what, I had this cleaning lady named Yolanda who was very wise."
Bobby Newport,She basically raised me.
Bobby Newport,"And one day she said, ""little Bobby, I'm not going to clean your room no mas."
Bobby Newport,""" And from that day on, my room was gross."
Bobby Newport,Really bummed me out.
Bobby Newport,"I think we should make our parks look like my room after Yolanda finally, you know, gave in and cleaned it up for me."
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us."
Leslie Knope,Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
Brandi Maxxxx,"I'd just like to say that, like Leslie, I don't have people do my work for me."
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie and I do our work ourselves.
Brandi Maxxxx,"My work, of course, is having sex with men and women on camera."
Joan Callamezzo,"Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person."
Tom Haverford,"But Bobby Newport is super handsome and charming, so that means people will probably vote for him because there's no justice in the world."
Extra,How do you respond to Newport's claim that the city parks need to be cleaned up?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope works tirelessly every day, so our parks can be the best they can be."
Ann Perkins,"78% of Pawneeans label our parks ""pristine."""
Tom Haverford,"And we all know the better looking a park is, the more attention it will get from lady parks who want to have sex with it."
Ann Perkins,Excuse us.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with you?
Ann Perkins,We're fighting for our lives out there.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I don't know."
Tom Haverford,"Maybe the fact that we just broke up, and you're already riding the Traeger train."
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,I saw you guys getting back together.
Tom Haverford,What about us?
Ann Perkins,"What about us, Tom?"
Ann Perkins,We're not together any more because you keep acting like an ass.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"I just act that way sometimes Because I'm nervous, and I feel like you're out of my league."
Tom Haverford,But I'd do anything to get back together with you.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,Vote for me to be your boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, he's winning."
Leslie Knope,How is he winning?
Leslie Knope,"Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you're doing fine."
Leslie Knope,I need to go back on the attack.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"See, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"When you attacked, you kind of came off like a bully, and he looked sympathetic, so, you know, you did a really good job of easing off."
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, this is fun, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Fester Trim,"Well, there's no reason on earth that I can think of that we shouldn't have concussion grenades in our nation's movie theaters."
Bobby Newport,"By the year 2013, we will have a fully functional mall on Jupiter."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election?"
Brandi Maxxxx,All my movies are based on books.
Manrico Della Rossa,And anyone who even rubs their hands on a leather jacket should be tried for murder.
Bobby Newport,I'm an American.
Bobby Newport,My father is an American.
Bobby Newport,My mother is an American.
Bobby Newport,My godfather is the viceroy of the principality of Liechtenstein.
Fester Trim,"Once again, people, grenade launcher."
Bobby Newport,Daniel Craig.
Bobby Newport,No Timothy Dalton.
Leslie Knope,"I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico."
Bobby Newport,"I guess my thoughts on abortion are You know, let's just all have a good time."
Fester Trim,I don't care about that issue.
Fester Trim,Just ask someone else.
Brandi Maxxxx,"For the record, I'd appear in a film with any of my fellow candidates."
Manrico Della Rossa,Anteaters.
Fester Trim,Kill shot.
Brandi Maxxxx,Money shot.
Bobby Newport,Fudgsicles.
Leslie Knope,Let's spend our money on what matters.
Leslie Knope,"Police, fire, parks, and schools."
Jennifer Barkley,"After a rough start, your girl's doing okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I think she's doing a little better than okay."
Ben Wyatt,Or did you miss the applause she got on the raccoon safety question?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, that was great."
Jennifer Barkley,That probably pulled her even with Bobby.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you're so casual about this.
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to win the debate?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, we're gonna win the debate."
Jennifer Barkley,Got an ace in the hole.
Jennifer Barkley,Little surpriseywisey.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you'll see."
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, quick question."
Jennifer Barkley,"Does that guy Chris Traeger have a girlfriend, and is his penis normal?"
Ben Wyatt,Stop talking.
Andy Dwyer,"You guys, uh, know anything about a guy named John Rambo?"
Andy Dwyer,Open on villagers being thrown out into a rice field.
Andy Dwyer,Land mines blowing them up into pieces.
Ron Swanson,"After I steal this cable feed, I will repay the cable company for the service we used."
Joan Callamezzo,This last question before the break is for Mr. Newport
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, some not me have criticized your involvement with your father's candy company Sweetums."
Joan Callamezzo,Would your affiliation with big business affect your decisions as a city councilor?
Bobby Newport,I want to run this town like a business.
Bobby Newport,"My opponent, Leslie Knope, has a very antibusiness agenda."
Bobby Newport,"Recently, my dad told me that if Leslie Knope wins the election, they'll probably have to move Sweetums to Mexico."
Bobby Newport,"That would be terrible, of course."
Bobby Newport,"Thousands of people in this town would lose their jobs, and we all wouldn't have candy."
Bobby Newport,"Now, I'm not saying that is gonna happen, but I do know this."
Bobby Newport,If I win I bet I could get them to stay.
Perd Hapley,Wow.
Perd Hapley,Shocking stuff.
Perd Hapley,"We're gonna be back with our closing statements right after a word from our sponsor, Sweetums, Pawnee's biggest supplier of candy and jobs."
Perd Hapley,Stick around.
Leslie Knope,So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?
Leslie Knope,How could they do that to this town?
Leslie Knope,What a crappy stunt to pull.
Extra,One minute back.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,I think we attack him.
Leslie Knope,He's more confident now.
Leslie Knope,I have to attack him.
Ben Wyatt,And say what?
Ben Wyatt,We didn't plan for this.
Ben Wyatt,What would you even say?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Leslie Knope,Just let me attack him.
Leslie Knope,I want to attack him.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's too risky.
Ben Wyatt,Just go with the closing statement we rehearsed.
Ben Wyatt,"Add a line at the end about how you're pro business, and we'll deal with the fallout tomorrow, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,What's the matter with you?
Leslie Knope,I can do it.
Leslie Knope,I can crush him.
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, screw it."
Ben Wyatt,Go get him.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Kick his ass.
Ron Swanson,I am lineman for the county and the Wichita lineman Is still the line
Perd Hapley,The final thing these candidates will say are their closing statements.
Perd Hapley,"We will begin with our first candidate to go, Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,How do we fix this town?
Bobby Newport,I have no idea.
Bobby Newport,You tell me.
Bobby Newport,That's what I'm counting on.
Bobby Newport,You telling me.
Andy Dwyer,And that's how it ends.
Andy Dwyer,I loved it.
Andy Dwyer,It's called Babe.
Andy Dwyer,And I know it sounds corny.
Andy Dwyer,Talking pig.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,You should all see it.
Donna Meagle,I feel like I just did.
April Ludgate,It's on.
Perd Hapley,"And, Leslie Knope, closing statement?"
Leslie Knope,I'm very angry.
Leslie Knope,I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
Leslie Knope,It's despicable.
Leslie Knope,Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
Leslie Knope,That power belongs to the people.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,"And when you love something, you don't threaten it."
Leslie Knope,You don't punish it.
Leslie Knope,You fight for it.
Leslie Knope,You take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You put it first.
Leslie Knope,"As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"If I seem too passionate, it's because I care."
Leslie Knope,"If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly."
Leslie Knope,"And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough."
Leslie Knope,This is my home.
Leslie Knope,You are my family.
Leslie Knope,And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Bobby Newport,"Holy [Bleep], Leslie, that was awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Bobby."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah! Play it.
Andy Dwyer,Woo-hoo! Knope 2012! Hyah! Hyah! Ron!
Chris Traeger,What the voters saw tonight is an undeniable fact.
Chris Traeger,"That one of these candidates is right for this town, and one of them is not."
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, guys."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Uh-oh.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Chris."
Ann Perkins,It's very flattering.
Ann Perkins,"I just, I just don't think it's a good idea."
Chris Traeger,It was worth a shot.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I hope that whoever you end up with treats like you like the amazing person that you are."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,And I am going to go run some stairs and work through these feelings.
Tom Haverford,Is he sad?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,He looks sad.
Ann Perkins,I'm not going out with Chris again.
Tom Haverford,Does that mean we're getting back together?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"No, not right now."
Ann Perkins,There's a chance I'm never gonna date anyone ever again.
Tom Haverford,I'll take it.
Tom Haverford,"And you know what else? I'm coming for you, girl Just Like You Want."
Ann Perkins,"Just get out there and spin, man."
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,Leslie Knope is scrappy like a terrier.
Tom Haverford,She's smooth like a blended whiskey.
Tom Haverford,"My girl has big ideas and big feelings, and she's not afraid to express them."
Leslie Knope,Was I too mean?
Ben Wyatt,"No, you were perfect."
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it was amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the spin room?"
Ann Perkins,It was a lot.
Ann Perkins,We'll talk about it.
Bobby Newport,"Woo! We did it! We did it! Oh, my God, I was so nervous, but we completely go through it."
Bobby Newport,"I haven't felt this good since I scored that lacrosse goal at state, seriously."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, party at my dad's lake house."
Bobby Newport,Bring whoever you want.
Andy Dwyer,"Scrawny Christians, missionaries, come to him, and they're like, ""Are you John Rambo?"" He's like, ""yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""we need you to take us upriver."""
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""it's a war zone up there."""
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""yeah, we know."""
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna change things.
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""you bringing any weapons?"" They're like, ""of course not."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Then you're not changing anything."""
Andy Dwyer,Go home.
Andy Dwyer,""" And then they come back in a rainstorm."""
Andy Dwyer,"This time he says, ""nope."""
Andy Dwyer,Go home.
Andy Dwyer,They go home again.
Andy Dwyer,"Bottom line, they go upriver."
Andy Dwyer,Does not go well.
