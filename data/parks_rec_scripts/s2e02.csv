Character,Line
Ann Perkins,I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so fine with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Seriously.
Leslie Knope,It's so fine.
Leslie Knope,As long as you and I are cool.
Leslie Knope,You know my code.
Leslie Knope,Hoes before bros.
Leslie Knope,Uteruses before duderuses.
Ann Perkins,Got it.
Leslie Knope,Ovaries before brovaries.
Leslie Knope,You make such good coffee.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually."
Ann Perkins,It was kind of weird.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex."
Leslie Knope,"You know, we slept together six years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm over it."
Leslie Knope,Or am I?
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
Leslie Knope,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit."
Leslie Knope,We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
Tom Haverford,It's so hot.
Tom Haverford,I had to get some more iced tea.
Leslie Knope,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
Leslie Knope,And Tom is our master horticulturist.
Leslie Knope,He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Like this.
Leslie Knope,"What's this, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,"Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems."
Tom Haverford,"Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers."
Leslie Knope,And those over there?
Tom Haverford,Those are some Diddys.
Tom Haverford,Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Leslie Knope,Growing beautifully.
Tom Haverford,Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Leslie Knope,"Look, someone planted something new."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,"What do you think, carrots?"
Leslie Knope,"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands."
Leslie Knope,Maybe some kind of spice?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, did you get my texts?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my emails?
Ron Swanson,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,Did you see that I paged you?
Ron Swanson,I did not.
Leslie Knope,Did you check your voicemail?
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Leslie Knope,We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Leslie Knope,Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Call the cops.
Leslie Knope,That'll leak to the press.
Leslie Knope,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding."
Ron Swanson,You don't have funding.
Leslie Knope,And we never will if this gets out.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here."
Ron Swanson,I have a hernia.
Ron Swanson,I've had it for a while.
Ron Swanson,"And I've been ignoring it, successfully."
Ron Swanson,"But this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing."
Ron Swanson,"But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good, I got this."
Leslie Knope,We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Leslie Knope,Who is this person?
Leslie Knope,Who is this kingpin?
Tom Haverford,"It's a 13 year old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana."
Leslie Knope,I ate a brownie once.
Leslie Knope,At a party in college.
Leslie Knope,It was intense.
Leslie Knope,"It was kind of indescribable, actually."
Leslie Knope,I felt like I was floating.
Leslie Knope,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
Leslie Knope,It was just an insanely good brownie.
Leslie Knope,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal."
Leslie Knope,"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot."""
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."""
Leslie Knope,We got to catch this guy.
Leslie Knope,"Get the van, meet me at 7:00."
Leslie Knope,It's stakeout time.
Ron Swanson,April?
April Ludgate,Yeah?
Ron Swanson,"Get my lunch for me, please."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Like, order you something?"
Ron Swanson,"No, get it."
Ron Swanson,From there.
April Ludgate,Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,That'll be all.
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,I have stakeout supplies.
Leslie Knope,This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
Leslie Knope,"We have notepads, pencils and pencil case."
Leslie Knope,Shakable whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Cameras.
Leslie Knope,Gorp.
Leslie Knope,And candy necklaces.
Leslie Knope,It's like we're real police.
Leslie Knope,And I made us a mix CD.
Leslie Knope,It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
Leslie Knope,It's mostly Sting.
Leslie Knope,"And look, I put our faces on there."
Tom Haverford,It's really cool.
Leslie Knope,Are you going to wear that shirt?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You like it?
Leslie Knope,Tommy Hilfiger?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Tom Haverford,Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here."
Leslie Knope,You should be wearing something like this.
Leslie Knope,Take this.
Leslie Knope,Wear black.
Leslie Knope,Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to figure out how this works."
Leslie Knope,Just let me focus up on this.
Tom Haverford,Pretty bummed this fits.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, take a test shot."
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Tom Haverford,Just focus up on the pit.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the--
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the weed is--
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Ann Perkins,Leslie swears it's okay.
Ann Perkins,So I'm going out with Mark.
Ann Perkins,I got to get back out there.
Ann Perkins,"When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie."
Ann Perkins,And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Ann Perkins,Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,It's Mark.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you ready to go?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,I need another hour to get ready.
Mark Brendanawicz,Seriously?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Cause I think the movie starts in like... Oh, you're joking around right now."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,This is going to be fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too."
Ann Perkins,Ew!
Mark Brendanawicz,That was silly.
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Are they dating now?
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz is the man.
Tom Haverford,This is Brendanawicz's life.
Tom Haverford,"Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital."
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,You know her name.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Tom Haverford,I'm just saying.
Tom Haverford,Nobody turns him down.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I did."
Leslie Knope,"We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, ""No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz."""
Leslie Knope,"""I don't need your business here."""
Leslie Knope,Get down.
Custodian,Working late?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Shovel guitar, shovel guitar Somebody wants to play shovel guitar"
Tom Haverford,Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Tom Haverford,Longer.
Leslie Knope,"Bucket drum, bucket drum You're not from here, right?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm from South Carolina.
Leslie Knope,But you moved to South Carolina from where?
Tom Haverford,My mother's uterus.
Leslie Knope,"But you were conceived in Libya, right?"
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I was conceived in America.
Tom Haverford,My parents are Indian.
Leslie Knope,Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
Tom Haverford,"My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics."
Leslie Knope,What about Barack Obama?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama."
Tom Haverford,"If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did you hear that noise?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's the kingpin!
Leslie Knope,Write this down.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, white male, light brown hair."
Tom Haverford,Just take pictures.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, it looks like Andy."
Tom Haverford,That is Andy.
Leslie Knope,That is Andy.
Leslie Knope,Andy is the kingpin.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, you guys."
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,It's so good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Quietly.
Andy Dwyer,What happened?
Tom Haverford,You're living in the pit now?
Andy Dwyer,"For now, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Andy Dwyer,"Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's our community garden."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, don't look at me."
Andy Dwyer,There's weed down there?
Andy Dwyer,I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Leslie Knope,"Right, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So why don't you come to the van and help us?
Leslie Knope,We're trying to catch the guy.
Leslie Knope,And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
Andy Dwyer,I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
Andy Dwyer,He's like 20 minutes late.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
Ron Swanson,April?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate,Catch.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I thought so."
April Ludgate,"I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back."
Ron Swanson,It's just a minor medical issue.
April Ludgate,AIDS?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm safe.
April Ludgate,Blindness?
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate,Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
Ron Swanson,I have a hernia.
April Ludgate,Do you have syphilis?
Ron Swanson,I said it's a hernia.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,It's possible to have two things.
April Ludgate,Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, please."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
Andy Dwyer,It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, oh, man."
Andy Dwyer,So how's Ann?
Andy Dwyer,She's doing good?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous."
Andy Dwyer,How's she doing?
Tom Haverford,Doing good tonight.
Tom Haverford,She's out on a--
Leslie Knope,Ann is great.
Leslie Knope,And I bet she really misses you.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Andy Dwyer,Is that candy?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy."
Leslie Knope,You want one?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, all right."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now."
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"You know, there's a string in there."
Andy Dwyer,Not in this one.
Andy Dwyer,Instant sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar hit high!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,High!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Andy Dwyer,Sugar slam!
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Ann Perkins,"So, that was fun."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,It really was.
Ann Perkins,Surprisingly fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
Mark Brendanawicz,"In fact, watch this."
Mark Brendanawicz,I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
Ann Perkins,Not a chance.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just... Watch what I'm going to do.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Ann Perkins,Will you come in for a nightcap?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I will."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Damn!
Mark Brendanawicz,Drat!
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to plan to notâ¦
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait."
Mark Brendanawicz,To say no.
Ann Perkins,"Look, that guy's trying to break into that van."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van."
Mark Brendanawicz,I just
Phone,9-1-1.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Leslie Knope,"So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,I just like being nearby.
Andy Dwyer,"That way, if she wants me back, I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind."
Leslie Knope,I don't really know how healthy that is.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore."
Leslie Knope,She might be dating somebody else.
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Is she dating somebody else?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Leslie Knope,I didn't say that.
Andy Dwyer,Who is she dating?
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Dave Sanderson,641 to base.
Dave Sanderson,I'm at the vehicle now.
Dave Sanderson,"How you doing tonight, sir?"
Tom Haverford,"I'm all right, Officer."
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Dave Sanderson,I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
Dave Sanderson,I need you to step out and show me some ID.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's okay."
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I work for the Parks Department.
Tom Haverford,I just got locked out of the van.
Tom Haverford,I had to jimmy my way back in.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I just told you my ID."
Tom Haverford,"So, what's the crime here?"
Tom Haverford,Parking while Indian?
Dave Sanderson,"No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles."
Tom Haverford,"All right, fine."
Tom Haverford,Here's my ID.
Tom Haverford,"Nice job, Paul Blart."
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?"
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Dave Sanderson,Step out of the van.
Tom Haverford,I'll step out of your mama's van.
Tom Haverford,I didn't do anything!
Tom Haverford,"I'm a city employee, man!"
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Ron Swanson,Motion sensors.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Tow Person,Cops took him.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,Ann and Mark!
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,It's Ann and Mark!
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz,We caught a criminal.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you know about this?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away."
Ann Perkins,It was crazy.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right here.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because--"
Dave Sanderson,"Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!"
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Nice job with that.
Dave Sanderson,But let's--
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you a question.
Leslie Knope,Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,"And thankfully, that's not what happened."
Dave Sanderson,"Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thank you, Officer."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Let's just go home, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's go home."
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Easy!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie--
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, come with me, please."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to come with you.
Dave Sanderson,"Your friend, he acted like an ass."
Dave Sanderson,"And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice."
Leslie Knope,"Your name's Dave, right? Can I call you Dave?"
Dave Sanderson,"My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50- 50."
Leslie Knope,"Hate to break it to you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,You really stepped in it.
Dave Sanderson,What?
Leslie Knope,"I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner."
Leslie Knope,"If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Dave Sanderson,What branch of government are you in?
Leslie Knope,Parks and Recreation.
Dave Sanderson,Parks and Recreation?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Dave Sanderson,"Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay? I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk."
Leslie Knope,It's just--
Dave Sanderson,"No, I'm being serious."
Dave Sanderson,We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Dave Sanderson,"Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date."
Dave Sanderson,"We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,Tom and I were in that van together.
Leslie Knope,"We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it."
Leslie Knope,"I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy."
Leslie Knope,I took the pictures.
Leslie Knope,My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
Leslie Knope,It's been a very long night.
Leslie Knope,"But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they're going to release him in a little while."
Ann Perkins,Thank God.
Mark Brendanawicz,Should I get you guys home right now?
Leslie Knope,"You know, you two go ahead."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, prison changes a man."
Leslie Knope,I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, okay, then."
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you, Leslie."
April Ludgate,Yo.
April Ludgate,I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
April Ludgate,You ready?
Ron Swanson,I was born ready.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron [bleep] Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,Care-- Careful.
Ron Swanson,Take--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in."
Mark Brendanawicz,Terrible things happened last time.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You kind of kissed me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I did! And now we both have herpes."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'll see you later.
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for waiting.
Tom Haverford,I appreciate it.
Leslie Knope,"Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate."
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Get your hands off that.
Tom Haverford,Wake up.
Leslie Knope,What? Is this your house? Where are we?
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,You're awake.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the coat.
Dave Sanderson,It's no problem.
Dave Sanderson,You can keep it.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Dave Sanderson,"Actually, no."
Dave Sanderson,I need that for my uniform.
Dave Sanderson,But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we'll talk about the coat.
Dave Sanderson,I can't give it to you.
Dave Sanderson,Do you understand?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"So, where's that marijuana at?"
Leslie Knope,It's down in the garden.
Tom Haverford,"Good meeting you, man! We should grab a drink or something sometime."
Leslie Knope,I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
Leslie Knope,"That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay."
Leslie Knope,And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Leslie Knope,Just important that they're both in their homes--
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Mark's an idiot.
Tom Haverford,You can do a lot better than him.
Tom Haverford,Forget about him.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford,I didn't mean me.
Tom Haverford,"Keep it in your pants, Knope."
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, it actually-- It was there"
Dave Sanderson,These are carrots.
Leslie Knope,Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Dave Sanderson,"Is that the house there, where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,I get it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date."
Leslie Knope,"No, I did not."
Leslie Knope,There actually was weed here
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,I think it's kind of cute.
Dave Sanderson,I like Miss Knope.
Dave Sanderson,I liked her.
Dave Sanderson,"I got to say, I--"
Dave Sanderson,"When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable."
Dave Sanderson,Miss Knope was attractive to me.
Dave Sanderson,"As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor."
Dave Sanderson,I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Dave Sanderson,Can we not I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Leslie Knope,What a crazy night.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, partner? Want to go get some breakfast?"
Tom Haverford,What? No! Take me home.
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if mini golf is open.
Tom Haverford,Home!
Ann Perkins,Especially if you're going to I know.
Tom Haverford,Anndanawicz! What're you guys doing? Eating? Love it.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night."
Tom Haverford,That was cool.
Tom Haverford,Peace!
Mark Brendanawicz,"We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal."
Ann Perkins,"For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert."
