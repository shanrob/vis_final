Paul,Gee whiz.
Paul,The Harvest Festival was a real triumph.
Paul,"We had over eighty thousand people in attendance, which surpassed our wildest expectations."
Paul,I would like to specifically single out Leslie Knope.
Paul,"I speak for the mayor, city council, and all of Pawnee when I say we can't wait to see what the heck you're going to do next."
Paul,"Step on up here, Les."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,Holy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Call 911!
Leslie Knope,That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
Leslie Knope,"All right, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.m. promptly.
Donna Meagle,Why are we doing this?
Leslie Knope,Harvest Fest is over.
Leslie Knope,We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
Leslie Knope,This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you just tell us what our next project is, and I'll go camping by myself."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have ideas, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 100 new ideas."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, the pressure is on."
Leslie Knope,We only have one chance to make a second impression.
April Ludgate,What portion of this camping trip will take place outside?
Leslie Knope,All of it.
April Ludgate,Pass.
Leslie Knope,Can't pass.
Leslie Knope,It's a mandatory work retreat.
Tom Haverford,I have a question.
Tom Haverford,What if we're scaling a cliff and I start to fall?
Tom Haverford,Can I grab onto your boob for support?
April Ludgate,"No, Tom, don't."
April Ludgate,Her boob kills.
Leslie Knope,My boob does not kill.
Leslie Knope,Paul did not die.
Leslie Knope,"He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life."
Chris Traeger,How's the best municipal department in Pawnee?
Chris Traeger,That's you guys.
Chris Traeger,Paul is going to be recuperating for a while.
Chris Traeger,"So, the mayor asked me to step in as City Manager."
Chris Traeger,And I of course accepted immediately because Pawnee is literally the greatest town in the country.
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I am gonna miss Indianapolis, which is the most wonderful city in America."
Chris Traeger,I'm so excited to be working with you all again.
Chris Traeger,"And Leslie, I cannot wait to hear your new big idea."
Chris Traeger,"I wanna hit the ground running, and your new mystery project is going to be the hydration pack that gets me to the finish line."
Chris Traeger,You're all my little hydration packs.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I am not.
Chris Traeger,Ron.
Chris Traeger,"Are, too."
Chris Traeger,Hydration pack!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious story that he's telling me."
Andy Dwyer,Tell her what happened.
Kyle,My identity was stolen.
Andy Dwyer,His identity was stolen.
Andy Dwyer,Tell her about the accounts.
Kyle,They were frozen.
Andy Dwyer,Frozen.
April Ludgate,"Bye, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,Where are you going?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,How's the coolest chick ever?
April Ludgate,Not good.
Andy Dwyer,What do you mean?
April Ludgate,Leslie's making us go on a camping retreat.
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Camping's the best.
April Ludgate,Camping sucks.
April Ludgate,It's super boring.
April Ludgate,"And you can see the stars, which I hate."
April Ludgate,They're creepy.
Andy Dwyer,I love camping.
Andy Dwyer,"I bet you I can get you to love it, too."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't I meet you out there?
Andy Dwyer,"If you hate it, we'll leave and go make out."
Andy Dwyer,"But if you love it, we'll stay and make out."
Andy Dwyer,"Either way, a ton of making out."
Andy Dwyer,You in?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I heard you were back.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I didn't do this because of you.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it looks great."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you look great."
Ann Perkins,Am I right?
Chris Traeger,It's So good running into you.
Chris Traeger,"You know, we should get together soon."
Chris Traeger,I'd love to catch up.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,Catch up and mustard.
Ann Perkins,Ketchup and mustard.
Chris Traeger,I just was-- Oh!
Chris Traeger,So delightful.
Chris Traeger,I relish your wit.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I salsa your face."
Ann Perkins,I should hate him.
Ann Perkins,He broke up with me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me."
Leslie Knope,But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
Leslie Knope,He was an amazing dentist.
Ann Perkins,"You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Ann Perkins,"What do you think ""We should get together soon"" means?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Do not read into this.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Come camping with us.
Leslie Knope,It'll be really fun.
Leslie Knope,You'll be away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,You can brainstorm.
Leslie Knope,I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Leslie Knope,Here is our official retreat schedule.
Leslie Knope,It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, everybody."
Ron Swanson,Let's hustle.
Ron Swanson,Let's get to the brainstorming!
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I just wanna get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.
Ron Swanson,Fishing relaxes me.
Ron Swanson,"It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,I call this wonderful spot.
Jerry Gergich,You didn't bring a tent?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't really go camping ever, Jerry."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm not going to spend 150 dollars on a tent."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
Ron Swanson,It's called the ground when it's outside.
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Do you guys do this a lot?
Ben Wyatt,Camping?
Tom Haverford,"I've never been before, but I think I'm gonna love it."
Tom Haverford,Why am I gonna love it?
Tom Haverford,SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,Come check out my tent.
Tom Haverford,I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,"I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD."
Tom Haverford,Awesome bed right there.
Tom Haverford,DJ Roomba's in the mix.
Tom Haverford,It's like I'm not even camping.
Tom Haverford,"This is actually a dog couch, but it's super comfortable."
Andy Dwyer,It's really important to me that April loves camping.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I went ahead and set up the ultimate campsite love nest."
Andy Dwyer,Complete with beautiful starlight.
Andy Dwyer,We got champagne.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, rose petals."
Andy Dwyer,"As you can see, they smell terrific."
Leslie Knope,"We need big ideas, and we need 'em now."
Leslie Knope,Who wants to go first?
Ron Swanson,I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.
Leslie Knope,"So, how much would that be per person?"
Ron Swanson,About 83 cents.
Ron Swanson,Per household.
Ron Swanson,Before postage.
Ron Swanson,Are we done?
Tom Haverford,"What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I know this one."
Jerry Gergich,They are all rappists.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,"They're rappers, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.
Tom Haverford,Until now.
Tom Haverford,The Pawnee Amphitheater.
Ann Perkins,How much would that cost?
Tom Haverford,Not that much.
Tom Haverford,"200, 300 million."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Donna Meagle,Luxury dog park.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to tell us any more?
Donna Meagle,Poodles only.
Donna Meagle,No pooping.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Where are you?
Andy Dwyer,I'm here.
Andy Dwyer,Where are you?
April Ludgate,"We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says ""Pawnee Campground."""
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a totally different place.
Andy Dwyer,That's why we can't see each other.
April Ludgate,"My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here."
April Ludgate,The air is too fresh.
April Ludgate,It's disgusting.
April Ludgate,I can't breathe.
April Ludgate,There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.
April Ludgate,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,Sweetheart.
Andy Dwyer,Just hold tight and I'll be there.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, April is right here."
Andy Dwyer,And I am down here somewhere.
Ben Wyatt,How about we just invest the money?
Ben Wyatt,Make 4% a year.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city."
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Tom Haverford,Great idea.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, white Urkel."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart."
Tom Haverford,What are you even still doing here?
Tom Haverford,Harvest Festival is over.
Tom Haverford,Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works."
Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,I didn't come up with anything.
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea."
Ron Swanson,She's got a point.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome."
Tom Haverford,That's what I'm calling my tent.
Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now."
Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.
Leslie Knope,Take an hour.
Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department."
Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,You really let 'em have it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice."
Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.
Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything."
Ann Perkins,Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?
Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
Ann Perkins,What about those binders in your office?
Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me."
Ann Perkins,"""I married Alf and we're pretty happy."""
Ann Perkins,That sounds nice.
Leslie Knope,It was.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, listen to me."
Ann Perkins,"You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine."
Leslie Knope,You're probably right.
Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have to save me."
April Ludgate,I'm camping with people I work with.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,April.
April Ludgate,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Walk around in circles like I am.
Andy Dwyer,Help triangulate the phone call.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Hang on.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.
Andy Dwyer,I found some thorns.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend."
Jerry Gergich,"But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity."
Ron Swanson,What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?
Jerry Gergich,You know what I should do?
Jerry Gergich,I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.
Ron Swanson,That might be incredibly effective.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,One second.
Tom Haverford,I'm just in the middle of a head massage.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a good stopping point."
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?
Tom Haverford,Here's a better idea.
Tom Haverford,How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Tom Haverford,I know Leslie seems upset.
Tom Haverford,"But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles."
Tom Haverford,"So, there's really no point."
Tom Haverford,Care for some fondue?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,How do you afford all this stuff?
Tom Haverford,I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.
Tom Haverford,The key is crying a lot.
Tom Haverford,No one likes to hear a grown man cry.
Tom Haverford,"""And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press!"""
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You wanna go for a walk?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,The sky is really beautiful.
Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal."
Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's really big.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you're gonna seal the deal."
Ben Wyatt,It's the chance you've been waiting for.
Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?"
Ben Wyatt,Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,Not at all.
Ben Wyatt,I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government."
Ron Swanson,"And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,Listen up.
Donna Meagle,What was that?
Leslie Knope,That was me talking.
April Ludgate,"No, I heard it, too."
April Ludgate,Andy?
Tom Haverford,"If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing here?
Chris Traeger,"I was just out for my night time run, and I thought, ""Why not go visit the Parks Department?"" How's everything going here?"
Leslie Knope,Super great.
Leslie Knope,Really well.
Leslie Knope,We have a great idea.
Chris Traeger,Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.
Chris Traeger,I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work?"
Chris Traeger,Oh! Sure.
Andy Dwyer,What was that? What was that?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us your idea."
Tom Haverford,"Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself."
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,What do you think? I don't have an idea.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something."
Leslie Knope,"But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed."
Leslie Knope,And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
Leslie Knope,And then we got it and we're good.
Leslie Knope,Go with that.
Ron Swanson,I think I'm gonna turn in.
Leslie Knope,You're not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
Leslie Knope,And that'll be fun.
Leslie Knope,"We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, ""Hey! No one sleep!"" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that."
April Ludgate,Is there anything else to eat? The marshmallows are all gone.
Ron Swanson,We have nothing to eat.
Ron Swanson,Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.
Donna Meagle,I wanna go home.
Donna Meagle,I miss my canopy bed.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I'm fine with not camping.
April Ludgate,Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me!
Ron Swanson,I'll fire up the van.
Chris Traeger,"You know, I've never moved this slowly before."
Chris Traeger,It's almost like being in quicksand.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, um, listen."
Ann Perkins,"When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing."
Ann Perkins,You just kind of took off.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, I never meant to hurt you."
Chris Traeger,"And well, I'm back now."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, I have a great idea."
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know? We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Tom Haverford,Chocolate or butterscotch?
Ben Wyatt,Swirl me.
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, camping is awesome."
Ben Wyatt,I love it.
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,How long have you been running power to this tent?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,How long have we been here?
Ron Swanson,Ten hours.
Tom Haverford,No! I was TiVoing Cupcake Wars.
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous!
Tom Haverford,"Look, I am used to a certain level of comfort in my life, and I didn't want to sacrifice that."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, I packed everything up."
Jerry Gergich,"So, now, you're telling me I have to go unpack it?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,"You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me."
Leslie Knope,"So, we can work all night."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so much fun! All night work! All night work! All night work!
Jerry Gergich,You know what? There's a bed and breakfast right up the road.
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna head there.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep brainstorming.
Leslie Knope,I have a good feeling about this B&B.
Leslie Knope,"One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, ""This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for"" Damn, I thought that would work."
Elsa Clack,Welcome to the quiet corn. I'm Elsa Clack.
Elsa Clack,Breakfast is served between 5:30 and 6:15 a.m.
April Ludgate,What if we sleep to a normal hour?
Elsa Clack,Well that would be very rude of you.
Elsa Clack,"May I take your breakfast order? We have hard-boiled eggs, homemade tomato slices with dry seed and leek jam, and your choice of German muffin."
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep] is a German muffin?
Ben Wyatt,Oh good Lord.
Tom Haverford,I call the bed.
Ben Wyatt,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,I hate this place. This place is the exact opposite of Sky Mall.
Ben Wyatt,Oh listen to this.
Ben Wyatt,"""Dear Quiet Corn, thank you for your beautiful inn. My wife and I spent three nights of ecstasy in this room."""
April Ludgate,There are no TVs anywhere.
April Ludgate,This place is lamer than outside.
Donna Meagle,I'm chilling.
April Ludgate,What is that?
Donna Meagle,Gin.
Andy Dwyer,"Sleeping in a tent, I'm sleeping in the tent."
April Ludgate,Oh my God.
Andy Dwyer,"Found you, oh I found you."
Andy Dwyer,and I had to fight a squirrel.
April Ludgate,Where have you been?
Andy Dwyer,"Told you I was gonna take you camping, didn't I?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm taking you camping. This is what I had set up at the other camp site."
Andy Dwyer,Except it was way nicer there.
Andy Dwyer,"But this will do. I have some champagne, and I had to drink most of it to survive, so I'm kind of buzzed right now."
April Ludgate,I'm just glad you're here. Can we make out now?
Chris Traeger,"You have to understand that at the time, I genuinely thought that you and I would never see each other again."
Ann Perkins,I complete understand.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's what makes you so amazing."
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, amazing."
Chris Traeger,Oh no.
Ann Perkins,Oh no?
Ann Perkins,Oh no.
Chris Traeger,I wasn't saying that I thought we should get back together again.
Ann Perkins,"But you said that, you indicated that, oh my God this is happening again."
Ann Perkins,I have to move right?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave the country."
Ann Perkins,"Bye everybody, bye."
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, couldn't sleep?"
Ron Swanson,"No, my room is filled with cat hair and cat smell."
Ron Swanson,"And actually cats, roughly twelve cats."
Leslie Knope,Sounds delightful.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"I am listening to ""Steal My Sunshine"" by Len, a one-hit wonder like me."
Ron Swanson,You're not a one-hit wonder.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will be."
Leslie Knope,"I peaked at the Harvest Festival, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Years from now, people are gonna say, ""Remember that woman that came up with the harvest festival idea? """
Leslie Knope,And never came up with another idea again? What happened to her?
Leslie Knope,"What was her name? Kim? Anyway, who cares, she's stupid and she's dead."
Leslie Knope,"For the first time ever, the Parks department has real momentum and I'm gonna ruin it for everybody."
Ron Swanson,You've done more for this group of people than anyone else.
Ron Swanson,You're the only reason we all still have jobs.
Ron Swanson,I think we'll be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well okay, I would love to chit-chat about this, but I need to keep working and keep pushing, so my breakthrough will happen and I will be ready for it."
Ron Swanson,"You know what, I just had an idea for a new project."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think this could be really really good."
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ron Swanson,Right through here.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's happening?"
Leslie Knope,Ron. Ron what are you doing?
Ron Swanson,"This is my idea. You're gonna shut your brain down and go to sleep, and I'm gonna stay out here and guard the door so you can't leave."
Leslie Knope,No Ron.
Ron Swanson,"You've been thinking about work nonstop for years, it's time to rest."
Leslie Knope,All my binders are downstairs.
Ron Swanson,"All due respect Ms. Clack, stick a German muffin in it."
Leslie Knope,"Fair enough, I'm just gonna go to bed, call it a night."
Ron Swanson,"I already checked Leslie, the transom is painted shut."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, there's like fifty cats in here."
Chris Traeger,Where's Leslie?
Ron Swanson,Not 100% sure.
Ben Wyatt,Should we reschedule or?
Ron Swanson,"Nope, she'll be here."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"So I just slept 7 hours, which is twice as long as I usually sleep, so I'm little disoriented."
Leslie Knope,"But I did wake up with a million ideas, and Ron would not let me have any paper, so I had to write them down on this doily."
Leslie Knope,We should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station in Ramsett Park an observatory.
Leslie Knope,"That way, we could sell tickets and have class trips."
Chris Traeger,I like it.
Leslie Knope,"Good. We'll have theme night at the park. Have singles, date night, seniors."
Leslie Knope,We could have a city-wide yard sale.
Leslie Knope,"Which could be part auction, part antique roadshow, then we could have professors come in and assign value to the objects."
Leslie Knope,"We could split the profits with the school, it'd be a lot of fun."
Ron Swanson,I'll see you boys later.
Leslie Knope,Bye Ron.
Leslie Knope,They say you're only as good as your last idea.
Leslie Knope,I say you're only as good as the people you work with.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope is back.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God my breath is so bad.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah she died like 20 minutes after that.
