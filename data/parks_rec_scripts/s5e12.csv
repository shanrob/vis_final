Character,Line
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal.
Ron Swanson,Dealer's choice.
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
JJ,"What can I get you, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,I will have oatmeal and berries.
Ann Perkins,"And I will have catfish and grits, with pumpernickel toast."
Ron Swanson,Explain.
Ann Perkins,"Well, instead of getting swept up in my boyfriends' personalities, I am dating myself and trying new things."
Ann Perkins,"So every time I go out to eat, I order one thing that's typical me and then something that I would never order."
Leslie Knope,"Now I have two best friends, Ann and Ann."
Leslie Knope,Each one more beautiful than the other.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I also have been documenting all the new things I'm trying on my blog."
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,I went skydiving.
Ben Wyatt,Which Ann is screaming like a maniac?
Ben Wyatt,Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, because I instantly blacked out from extreme terror."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I have an idea for your blog."
Leslie Knope,I think you should take yourself iceskating.
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to warn you, I'm very good at iceskating."
Leslie Knope,I can do jumps.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,I probably shouldn't come.
Leslie Knope,I'll embarrass the both of you.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, I know what my next activity is gonna be."
Ann Perkins,And it's a biggie.
Ann Perkins,I want to be a mom.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to the sperm bank today.
Ann Perkins,Can you come?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, today?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself in creating the family that she wants."
Leslie Knope,But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multiethnic genius babies."
Ann Perkins,"Maybe, or maybe not."
Ann Perkins,"You hit the lottery with Ben, and that's great, but not everybody's so lucky."
Ann Perkins,"I've wanted to be a mom for a long time, I'm ready, and I think I'd be good at it."
Leslie Knope,Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.
Leslie Knope,And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.
Leslie Knope,"If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, ""Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum."""
Leslie Knope,Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.
Chris Traeger,What a gorgeous herbaceous medley.
Ron Swanson,There's been a mistake.
Ron Swanson,You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
Extra,Salad is traditionally the first course at a wedding.
Ron Swanson,Is a gerbil marrying a rabbit?
Ben Wyatt,I'm in charge of food for the wedding.
Ben Wyatt,So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.
Ben Wyatt,Chris loves vegetables.
Ben Wyatt,Ron loves meat.
Ben Wyatt,"And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so I liked number one, Chris liked number two, and Ron liked number three."
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, what about you?"
Tom Haverford,"Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting."
Tom Haverford,"Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret."
Ben Wyatt,Nothing you're saying is helpful.
Tom Haverford,But number three's told a story a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.
Ben Wyatt,That's nonsense.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna go with the first place.
Ben Wyatt,I really loved that appetizer.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, the mini calzone?"
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't call it that.
Ben Wyatt,It was more like a savory pastry.
Ben Wyatt,"Delicate little dough pocket filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and seasoned meat."
Ben Wyatt,Just a stunning culinary innovation.
Ron Swanson,It was a calzone.
Chris Traeger,It was literally just a small calzone.
Extra,Let me just get some details for your file.
Extra,"Now, are you two a couple?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Tragically, we are both heterosexual."
Extra,"So, Ann, what are you looking for in particular?"
Ann Perkins,Some sperm.
Extra,I meant in terms of a donor?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you know, nice guy Nice sperm."
Extra,"Flip through this binder, make a note of anyone who interests you, and I'll be back shortly."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,This guy went to Harvard!
Leslie Knope,So did the Unabomber.
Ann Perkins,This guys seems healthy.
Ann Perkins,Loves cycling.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user."
Leslie Knope,Or a hero.
Leslie Knope,I don't know where we stand on him now.
Joe From Sewage,"Hello, ladies."
Joe From Sewage,Fancy meeting you here.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, Sewage Joe."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham."
Leslie Knope,He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.
Joe From Sewage,Guilty.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what the judge said."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you are a donor here, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Did you hear that, Ann?"
Joe From Sewage,"Big time, me and all my buddies."
Joe From Sewage,"Free money, free porn."
Joe From Sewage,Best job I ever had.
Joe From Sewage,"Also If you're looking to buy some weed, I'm looking as well."
Leslie Knope,Shall we?
Ann Perkins,Yup.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie Knope outfit number eight."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look super hot."
Donna Meagle,You realize you've said that about all of them?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, she has, every single time."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause she is super hot.
Andy Dwyer,"Honestly, you'd look hot naked."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,This suit makes me want to scold a Catholic child.
April Ludgate,"I don't know who Ann Taylor is, but I hate her and I want to kill her."
April Ludgate,"I have to lead a public forum for the Pawnee Commons every day this week, and I hate talking to people."
April Ludgate,"So, to get through it, I figured I'm just gonna basically try to imitate Leslie."
April Ludgate,She still wears this.
April Ludgate,She had the patch sewn in.
April Ludgate,You can't remove it.
April Ludgate,"What's in the pocket, you ask?"
April Ludgate,"A ticket stub from a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995, and"
Donna Meagle,"This one is terrible, but it is slightly less terrible than the rest."
April Ludgate,"So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants."
Andy Dwyer,Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.
Ann Perkins,So what's the next move?
Ann Perkins,"Is there, like, a better sperm bank in Eagleton or something?"
Leslie Knope,"Um, you don't want a demon baby."
Leslie Knope,"Look, you're Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.
Leslie Knope,"I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz hopefully, he does."
Leslie Knope,You'd want to know him.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Leslie, you're totally right."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna make a list of all the guys I already know who could be donors."
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm gonna call them and tell them I'm doing some blog entry on men's health or something."
Ann Perkins,I can interview them and ask them whatever I want.
Ann Perkins,You're a genius!
Ann Perkins,"This is your idea, and I love it."
Ann Perkins,I'll call you later.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate."
Leslie Knope,I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.
Leslie Knope,"In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me."
Ann Perkins,I was up all night brainstorming and this is the complete official list of candidates for Ann's baby daddy.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, how did you come up with these three names?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, I eliminated everyone in a relationship and the obvious ""No"" s, like Knucklehair Dave from HR."
Ann Perkins,I don't mind the knuckle hair.
Ann Perkins,I just think he's a dick.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And I was left with those three guys.
Ann Perkins,"Don't forget, they don't know about the sperm donor thing."
Ann Perkins,I don't want them to know.
Ann Perkins,I told them I was interviewing them for a blog.
Ann Perkins,Here comes the first one.
Ann Perkins,Dr. Harris!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there he is."
Dr. Harris,Hi.
Dr. Harris,"Ann, Leslie."
Dr. Harris,Small office.
Dr. Harris,Mine's way bigger.
Dr. Harris,Is this gonna take long?
Dr. Harris,Got a patient coming in.
Ann Perkins,"No, not at all."
Ann Perkins,Please have a seat.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, maybe you should check in on your patient."
Leslie Knope,I know that I hate it when my doctor makes me wait.
Dr. Harris,Guy's got a spinal fracture.
Dr. Harris,He's not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Dr. Harris,Ooh.
Dr. Harris,The seats in my office are leather.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Chris?
Ben Wyatt,I'm dying.
Chris Traeger,I was dying earlier today.
Chris Traeger,And then I died.
Chris Traeger,Now I'm dead.
Chris Traeger,I had to cancel a date with Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Chris Traeger,And I really like her.
Chris Traeger,Do you think she'll still like me now that I'm dead?
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Ron Swanson,It's food poisoning.
Ron Swanson,I have it too.
Ron Swanson,I did not sleep for one second last night.
Ron Swanson,And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, don't say that."
Chris Traeger,Has anybody talked to Tom?
Chris Traeger,I can't even imagine what that tiny little man must be feeling like.
Ron Swanson,I have voided more than Tom's body weight in the last 12 hours alone.
Ron Swanson,He might have just disappeared off the earth.
Chris Traeger,We need to call him.
Chris Traeger,We must reach out to him.
Chris Traeger,I can't do it.
Ron Swanson,"Ben, extension 7820."
April Ludgate,"Hello, everyone."
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate from the Parks Department.
April Ludgate,And welcome to a public forum about the Pawnee Commons.
April Ludgate,"As Eleanor Roosevelt once said to Betty Ford ""Hillary Clinton is great."""
April Ludgate,"Now, if you all would kindly look under your chairs, you will find a special surprise a flyer with details about the project, and Friendship bands that I've made for each and every one of you."
April Ludgate,"So now, I guess we're Park Pals."
Andy Dwyer,You should see the booger under this chair.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Pete Disellio,"It's nice to see you again, Ann."
Pete Disellio,I was happy to get the call.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pete, you look great."
Pete Disellio,Aww.
Ann Perkins,So are you still dunking basketballs?
Pete Disellio,"You know, I'm a lot more than just a former high school basketball star."
Pete Disellio,I teach marketing over at Pawnee Community College.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's great."
Pete Disellio,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Would you say you value education?
Pete Disellio,I see what's going on here.
Pete Disellio,You want my sperm.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Pete Disellio,When will women in this town stop scheming to get my sperm?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That son of a bitch is astute.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all I need to do is just shoot one more person down and then I can buy some time and convince Ann to wait for her own Ben level soul mate."
Leslie Knope,The last guy is Howard Tuttleman.
Leslie Knope,I know that name.
Leslie Knope,How do I know that name?
The Douche,"I know it's a winter's morn, but it feels like a summer's eve, 'cause ""the douche"" is in the building."
The Douche,"What's up, ladies?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, whoa!"
Tom Haverford,Smells like some vomit took a dump in here.
Tom Haverford,What happened?
Ron Swanson,"We got food poisoning, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Yuck.
Ron Swanson,How do you not have food poisoning?
Ben Wyatt,Because he didn't eat anything.
Ben Wyatt,"He just took pictures and talked about the ""wow"" factor."
Tom Haverford,Not true.
Tom Haverford,I ate everything you did.
Chris Traeger,Are you sure?
Chris Traeger,Is there anything that you didn't eat?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I didn't eat those stupid mini calzones.
Tom Haverford,Haverfood rule number six never eat anything with a sauce I have to dip myself.
Tom Haverford,Drizzle it on for me.
Tom Haverford,I'm not your maid.
Ben Wyatt,The calzones betrayed me?
Ben Wyatt,"Never again, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"As God as my witness, they're dead to me."
Tom Haverford,"All right, well, Tommy feels great."
Tom Haverford,And I'm about to go eat some lasagna.
Tom Haverford,Peace!
Extra,I'm afraid this park will raise my taxes.
April Ludgate,"Ah, well, fear not."
April Ludgate,Between the normal Parks budget and our corporate partners
Extra,I'm also afraid the park will be noisy.
Extra,And full of spiders.
Extra,And dark at nighttime.
Extra,I'm scared of a lot of stuff.
Extra,Everything's fine.
Extra,I'm fine.
Extra,"I'm Walter, and I'm fine."
Harris,Is this gonna be a topless park?
April Ludgate,I don't think there are topless parks.
Harris,"Well, let's build the first one and be heroes."
Gretel,"If this is going to be a topless park, I won't sign your petition."
Harris,"If she's going to the topless park, I'm not signing the topless park petition."
Harris,"You know, I take that back, I'm still in."
Harris,What's up?
Harris,I'm Harris.
Chance Frenlm,"Yeah, yeah."
Chance Frenlm,Forget whatever that Pawnee Commons is.
Chance Frenlm,I'm with that pervert.
Chance Frenlm,Topless park.
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Ann Perkins,Where'd you go to school again?
The Douche,Northwestern.
The Douche,I studied semiotics.
The Douche,Wrote a thesis on narrative forms in the digital world.
Leslie Knope,"Then you became a morning shockjock and created the sport ""taint ball""?"
The Douche,Yeah.
The Douche,"You know, the douche persona is something I came up with during college."
The Douche,"It started as satire, and, you know, we snowballed to where we are today."
The Douche,"I mean, I know it's a silly thing to do, but it pays the bills."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants."
The Douche,"Actually, a farting immigrant segment would be really funny."
The Douche,"Ay dios Good looking out, Leslie."
The Douche,"You guys ever want to do this again, sans clothing, give me a shout."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,"Honestly, good luck on this project."
The Douche,It sounds really interesting.
The Douche,"I'm gonna scan a quick pic of them boobies for a little deposit in ""El banco de spanko."""
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,Douche nation.
The Douche,You guys know where the library is?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's not gonna work."
Leslie Knope,Back to the drawing board.
Ann Perkins,No need.
Ann Perkins,I choose Howard.
Leslie Knope,You want to have a baby with the douche?
Ann Perkins,"His name's Howard Tuttleman, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"And I know he plays that obnoxious character on the radio, but he's a good guy, his family is healthy, and he is successful and smart."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you cannot be serious."
Ann Perkins,I am.
Ann Perkins,And I've made my decision.
Ann Perkins,I am sure of it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Douche!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, douche!"
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Councilman Howser,Councilwoman Knope.
The Douche,"'Sup, Leslie?"
The Douche,You wanna funk this junk in the back of my trunk?
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, Ann is not interviewing you for her blog."
Leslie Knope,"She's thinking about having a baby, and she's considering you as a possible donor."
The Douche,Wow.
The Douche,"You know, I've thought a lot about having kids."
The Douche,It's the next big step in this grand adventure that we call life.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I don't think you would be the right man for the job."
The Douche,"Well, frankly, I don't think it's for you to decide."
The Douche,"You know, if we had a little girl, I would name her Elizabeth, after my grandmother."
The Douche,"She was this strong, amazing woman."
The Douche,"And if we had a boy, I don't know, I'd name him something funny, like ""Dick"" or ""O.J."""
The Douche,Guess I have a lot to consider.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,I have driven Ann right into the belly of the douche.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what's up?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, nothing."
Ann Perkins,"I was listening to the radio on my way here, and I heard something very interesting."
The Douche,"So, Crazy Ira, remember that chick Ann I used to"
Crazy Ira,"Yeah, she was smoking hot!"
The Douche,"Turns out, she wants to have my baby."
The Douche,"Anyway, her lesbo friend tells me she's on the prowl for some baby beans And it's down to me and some other turdmunchers."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You should be angry.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Howard did that to you.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you did that to me.
Ann Perkins,"I am making a very important life decision, and you betrayed me."
Leslie Knope,Because I thought you were making a huge mistake.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did."
Ann Perkins,My idea of a perfect family does not require a soul mate.
Ann Perkins,"I want a baby, that's it, accept it."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?"
Councilman Milton,"Oh, no, no, no."
Councilman Milton,"I just wanted to toss my name into the ring, in respect to this Indian woman's vagina."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, how was the forum?"
April Ludgate,"Um, crappy."
April Ludgate,We only got four signatures.
April Ludgate,"Two of them were me and Andy, and one of them said ""Farts McCool."""
April Ludgate,I just don't know how Leslie can be Leslie all the time.
April Ludgate,I was her for two hours and I want to die.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,We've got another forum today.
Andy Dwyer,Let's just hop back in that saddle.
April Ludgate,What should I do?
April Ludgate,Should I wear a blonde wig?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, yes."
Andy Dwyer,That would be so hot.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,If you think if you do you think it would help?
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if you think it'd help you."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm feeling so much better."
Chris Traeger,Almost no weird stuff snuck out of my body last night.
Ron Swanson,And I feel like the emptiness of my stomach is gonna lead to a pretty epic breakfast.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, what do I do?"
Ben Wyatt,"My choice almost killed us, and we can't agree on another one, so"
Chris Traeger,Maybe there's a catering company in Snerling that we should look into.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it has to be from Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,I just know that's what Leslie wants.
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"This might sound crazy, but JeanRalphio has started a catering company."
Ben Wyatt,He has?
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, he is currently standing trial for counterfeiting Euros, but the trial's gonna be over quick."
Tom Haverford,He's definitely guilty.
Ben Wyatt,"Ugh, forget it."
JJ,Dry toast and half a grapefruit for Chris.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
JJ,Egg whites for Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
JJ,"Egg whites for Tom, and pretty much everything we make for Ron."
JJ,And don't you go sneaking off.
JJ,I'm sending home some free waffles for Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, JJ."
Ben Wyatt,You're the best.
The Douche,"Okay, we're back."
The Douche,"We, uh, got an update on ""Operation Baby douche."""
The Douche,"All right, special guest is Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
The Douche,"How are you, les?"
Extra,"""Me so horny."""
Leslie Knope,That was not me.
Leslie Knope,That was a farcical sound effect.
Crazy Ira,"Did she say ""fartsicle""?"
The Douche,The fartsicle.
The Douche,Frozen farts you can eat.
The Douche,Put it in your facemouth!
Extra,It's cold and it smells.
Leslie Knope,"God, how did you make that so fast?"
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, look, I am here because I want you to stop talking about my friend's womb."
The Douche,"Sorry, Councilwoman."
The Douche,I'm in it to win it.
The Douche,The douche is gonna be a daddy.
Crazy Ira,And Crazy Ira's gonna be the creepy Uncle.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Look, she is a wonderful person, and she does not deserve this."
Leslie Knope,So I need you to lay off.
The Douche,"Okay, I will lay off if you can survive one round with Breasty Bertha in The Jello Pit!"
Extra,Rudy!
Extra,Get in the Jello.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am a city councilwoman, so I am not gonna Jello wrestle."
The Douche,"I mean, this is fun."
The Douche,Don't you want your constituents to know that you got a fun side?
Crazy Ira,"Yeah, show your fun sides."
Leslie Knope,This is not about me and my constituents!
Leslie Knope,This is about you talking about my friend.
The Douche,"All right, I will stop talking about your friend if you get in that Jello for one second and say, ""Rudy."""
The Douche,Cause The Cosby Show.
The Douche,Classic.
Crazy Ira,Classic.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I will stand there for one second and say it, and then we're done."
Crazy Ira,Fair's fair.
The Douche,Fair's fair.
Extra,Somebody get me a pudding pop.
The Douche,Oh! Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,"There, happy?"
Crazy Ira,"No, say it like Bill Cosby."
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
The Douche,"Yeah! Oh, she's touching her boobs now."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm just standing here.
Leslie Knope,"And I am leaving, just like you're gonna leave Ann alone."
The Douche,"Oh, she's in there! She's into it now!"
Extra,"Oh, Rudy has fallen into the Jello."
Extra,"Theo, now there's Jello all over my favorite sweater."
Crazy Ira,And the gold medal goes to Leslie Knope!
April Ludgate,"Okay, can you give me that bag? I have to go change into my Leslie suit."
Andy Dwyer,"You got it, babe."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,This is the wrong bag.
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,This bag is full of Fruit RollUps and baseball cards.
April Ludgate,I don't have my Leslie pantsuit or my Leslie headband or my Leslie notes.
April Ludgate,I can't do this meeting without my Leslie stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I am so sorry."
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I guess I must have screwed up.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you look amazing in this outfit."
Andy Dwyer,Plus you're the smartest person on the planet.
Andy Dwyer,I think you can do this just being yourself.
Extra,"Yeah, so how much money is this whole Pawnee Commons project gonna cost me?"
April Ludgate,"Uh, good question."
April Ludgate,40% wiill be coming from our corporate partners and another 30%
Extra,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Extra,I didn't ask for a math lesson.
Extra,So why don't you just tell me how much it's gonna cost me? And don't use numbers.
April Ludgate,"Look, you won't have to pay any extra money, okay? And don't ever call me ""ma'am"" again."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Next question.
Harris,"Yeah, I wanted to talk more about that topless park idea that a local hero brought up yesterday."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, there's not gonna be a topless park, Harris."
April Ludgate,"Nobody wants your creepy stoner eyes staring at them while they're enjoying a park, okay? Stop being gross."
Harris,Yeah.
Harris,"Shut me down! You scare me, and I gotta say, I kinda dig that."
Harris,What's your deal?
Andy Dwyer,She's married to me.
Ann Perkins,I heard you on the radio.
Ann Perkins,Thanks for doing that.
Leslie Knope,Got dicey.
Leslie Knope,But they did invite me to participate in their topless Jello-lympics
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Leslie Knope,So that's something.
Ann Perkins,It is possible that you were right.
Ann Perkins,"This is obviously a huge decision, and I should take my time."
Leslie Knope,"I want you to be happy, you know? I guess I just didn't consider that you would take a different path than I did."
Leslie Knope,"I tried to impose my dream on you, and that's wrong."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,But I think you do need to take a little bit more time with this decision.
Leslie Knope,Maybe employ a more methodical approach.
Leslie Knope,One that involves colorcoded binders.
Ann Perkins,"Is that a drawing of my reproductive system saying ""Let's do this""?"
Leslie Knope,The Knope way involves a lot of uterine cartoons.
Leslie Knope,"What can I tell you? Besides, what is more cuter-us than your uterus?"
Leslie Knope,"You ready, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,We're in it now.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we are."
Leslie Knope,Let's make a baby together.
Ann Perkins,You should phrase that differently.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Are you sure you're cool with JJ's Diner catering what you've referred to as ""The wedding of the millennium""?"
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,I thought that I could not love you any more than I already did.
Leslie Knope,But I was dead wrong.
Ben Wyatt,Is that smoke?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Hey! What are you doing?
April Ludgate,Celebrating.
April Ludgate,"We got 80 signatures and, like, 30 complaints of excessive rudeness, but who cares?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you should have seen her, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,She was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"So smart, so hot, so mean."
Andy Dwyer,I wanted to bone her right there in that dirty church basement.
Leslie Knope,"No, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, we are burning this awful pantsuit."
Leslie Knope,That's mine.
Leslie Knope,I wanted that back.
April Ludgate,"Well, frankly, you should have thought of that before we burned it."
