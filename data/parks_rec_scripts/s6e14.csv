Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Enough's enough.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.
Ron Swanson,"Dear God, woman."
Leslie Knope,"Three main activities: baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?"
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,So cute!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I have some gift ideas.
Leslie Knope,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.
Ron Swanson,We already have a stroller.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shoot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to think of something else.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, whose baby is that?"
Ron Swanson,That would be mine.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, get in here!"
Leslie Knope,Ron has a baby!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron, cool baby."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces."
Ron Swanson,"Much like his father, he is a fan of silence."
Ron Swanson,Please keep your voices down.
Leslie Knope,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?"
Ron Swanson,Why would you need to know something like that?
Leslie Knope,"Why would I-- oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I have not even sent Diane a gift.
Leslie Knope,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet."
April Ludgate,Should we do something?
Ron Swanson,Just let her tire herself out.
Jerry Gergich,"If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know."
Ron Swanson,Actually there is something.
Ron Swanson,Could one of you please stop by the pet store and pick up some fish food for me?
Leslie Knope,When did you get a fish?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, youth committee."
Leslie Knope,Update on the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Madison.
Madison,"So far, 12 bands have said yes."
Madison,And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.
April Ludgate,I think we should book Orin as a headliner.
April Ludgate,I think it's a no-brainer.
April Ludgate,"Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel."
April Ludgate,"The Pawnee Journal called it, ""Why would anyone do this?"""
Leslie Knope,Stop suggesting Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Craig, any update on the art tents?"
Craig Middlebrooks,14 local artists signed up to show their work.
Craig Middlebrooks,"It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as ""Jackson Pollockesque"" and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!"
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town."
Leslie Knope,"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me."
Leslie Knope,"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario."
Leslie Knope,You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.
Leslie Knope,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.
Leslie Knope,No one knows who that is?
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I do."
Andy Dwyer,"""Grant Larson,"" otherwise known as Elton John."
Andy Dwyer,"Congratulations, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville?
Leslie Knope,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,"He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,"Great idea, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!"
Leslie Knope,And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.
Tom Haverford,"This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights."
Tom Haverford,You think I wouldn't notice?
Tom Haverford,"You look fly as hell, girl!"
Tom Haverford,"This unity concert needs corporate sponsorship, so Ben and I are meeting with local bigwigs."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna do what I do best-- lock down deals.
Tom Haverford,And dorkasaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.
Ben Wyatt,You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm your boss."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, he's so cute."
Donna Meagle,You're the cutest little boobear I've ever seen.
Craig Middlebrooks,You are the world's most adorable baby and I love you!
Craig Middlebrooks,You are so freaking precious!
Jerry Gergich,Look what Gayle made for the baby.
Jerry Gergich,"It says ""Property of Pawnee government."""
Jerry Gergich,Isn't that adorable?
Ron Swanson,"Come on, John."
Donna Meagle,Geez.
Leslie Knope,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer."
Leslie Knope,Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.
Leslie Knope,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.
April Ludgate,"Hey, one question."
April Ludgate,"Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says ""Pawnee, you suck,"" or ""Go home, Eagleton snobs""?"
Leslie Knope,I painted over that graffiti a week ago.
Leslie Knope,These people are the worst!
Leslie Knope,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, why do we even have this wall?"
Leslie Knope,"We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them."
Leslie Knope,We should just knock it down.
Andy Dwyer,"On it, boss."
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,The kool-aid guy makes it look so easy.
Ron Swanson,"In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work."
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.
Ron Swanson,If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.
Ron Swanson,Ooh!
Ron Swanson,This place is a paradise!
Ben Wyatt,"Nicely done, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,We have 15 sponsorship offers.
Mitch Savner,Make that 16.
Mitch Savner,Mitch Savner.
Tom Haverford,Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!
Mitch Savner,That's it.
Tom Haverford,You guys make my favorite teeth whitening strips pearlies for girlies.
Tom Haverford,It's unisex.
Tom Haverford,The cartoon princess on the label says so.
Mitch Savner,I'll sponsor your concert.
Mitch Savner,But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.
Mitch Savner,I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.
Tom Haverford,I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.
Mitch Savner,Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Tom Haverford,I'll see you then.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's pretty cool."
Tom Haverford,"It's all happening, Ben."
Tom Haverford,"Soon I'll have a new career, new crib, new friends."
Tom Haverford,"If all goes well, this may be one of the last times I ever have to speak to you."
Tom Haverford,"Come with me, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone, for coming."
Leslie Knope,And a special thank you to the city council for their support.
Jeremy Jamm,I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?
Leslie Knope,Just take some beef jerky and hush!
Leslie Knope,This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"This three day music and arts festival will end on a day we will call ""New Founder's Day,"" an official beginning to our new town."
Leslie Knope,"A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time to tear down this wall.
Leslie Knope,"In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike."
Leslie Knope,"Take it away, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is such a great day for--
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Nobody panic!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ohhh, noooo!"
Extra,Ah!
Extra,It stung me in the eyeball!
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, man, this is amazing, man."
Jeremy Jamm,The stupid Eagletonians are totally getting the pwned by these bees.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm gonna send this straight to tosh.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ow, [bleep]!"
Jeremy Jamm,[Bleep]!
Andy Dwyer,"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you."
Andy Dwyer,"I got stung once, I'm immune."
Andy Dwyer,"Go ahead and sting me, bees."
Andy Dwyer,It does nothing.
Extra,"Leslie, it appears that most of the people that were stung were from Eagleton."
Extra,How did you pull that off?
Leslie Knope,I didn't pull anything off.
Leslie Knope,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians."
Extra,"How did you get your bees into the wall, and how long did it take to plan this hilarious bee prank on Eagleton?"
Leslie Knope,"They were not my bees, Trodd."
Leslie Knope,And for the last time this was not a prank.
Leslie Knope,I did not know that bees were in that wall.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement."
Leslie Knope,Everybodyâ¦ should check their walls for bees.
Extra,"Nice try, prank queen."
Extra,Probably bees in there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's all the time I have."
Extra,What else can you do with your bees?
Extra,"Leslie, what's your next prank?"
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,I cannot meet with him right now.
Leslie Knope,"We are in crisis mode, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster."
Jerry Gergich,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait!"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Larry, don't tell him that."
Leslie Knope,Don't mention my bee hole.
Ron Swanson,"Just as we suspected, John."
Ron Swanson,"We repaired the valve stem seal, and now all that remains is to tighten down this packing nut."
Ron Swanson,Andâ¦ that should do it.
Extra,Can we help you?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We have everything under control.
Extra,My crew's redoing this whole floor.
Extra,We're the only people allowed up here right now.
Ron Swanson,"Well, proceed with your work."
Ron Swanson,You won't notice us at all.
Extra,We're gonna be kinda loud.
Ron Swanson,My son is several weeks old.
Ron Swanson,He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, how about this one Lasik for fingernails?"
Tom Haverford,"Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again."
Tom Haverford,All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.
Ben Wyatt,Seems impossible.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh!
Tom Haverford,"""Saltweens."""
Tom Haverford,Saltines for tweens.
Ben Wyatt,Seems unnecessary?
Tom Haverford,The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,"Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's ""Riskiest Businesses"" issue."
Ben Wyatt,"That was their last issue before they folded, actually."
Ben Wyatt,Magazines are also very risky.
Tom Haverford,"I can't believe an angel investor floated down from the heavens, and I don't even have anything to pitch him."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, you must've had one good business idea."
Tom Haverford,You're 52 years old!
Ben Wyatt,"No, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,But I do have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,It's air-tight.
Ben Wyatt,"But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy."
Tom Haverford,What is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Tom Haverford,"You're right, man."
Tom Haverford,That is not sexy.
Mike Patterson,Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.
Mike Patterson,This bee incident is just the latest assault coming from the Pawnee side of this merger.
Craig Middlebrooks,Mike Patterson is Eagleton's most tenacious reporter.
Craig Middlebrooks,"When he sinks his teeth into something, he's like a dog with a bone!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert."
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody think that was a prank?
Andy Dwyer,So sad.
Andy Dwyer,People will believe anything.
Andy Dwyer,"It was a prank though, right?"
April Ludgate,"No more press, okay?"
April Ludgate,You just have to lay low for a while.
April Ludgate,I promise it'll all blow over.
Leslie Knope,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person."
April Ludgate,"Fine, but no cameras."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I won't bring any."
Craig Middlebrooks,Aghh!
Craig Middlebrooks,I can't handle all this fighting.
Craig Middlebrooks,It's like Thanksgiving 2004 all over again!
Craig Middlebrooks,Don't even ask!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Somebody follow me, I'm distraught!"
Extra,Who's a big guy?
Extra,"Man, forget about working."
Extra,I just wanna stare at this baby all day.
Ron Swanson,What is the nature of your work on this floor?
Extra,"Total redo-- new floors, fixtures, plumbing."
Ron Swanson,How long will it take?
Extra,Six to eight weeks.
Ron Swanson,Deal.
Ron Swanson,I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.
Ron Swanson,Just have your tools and materials brought up here.
Extra,Are you crazy?
Extra,This is enough work for a whole crew.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignorance."
Ron Swanson,"But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless."
Extra,Okay.
Extra,"Guys, let's go!"
Ron Swanson,I got all help I'll need right here.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is the really exciting part."
Ben Wyatt,"We buy tetrachloroethylene at 1.60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.38 a gallon."
Ben Wyatt,Now I know what you're thinking.
Ben Wyatt,What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?
Tom Haverford,"Ben, stop!"
Tom Haverford,This is so boring!
Tom Haverford,This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you."
Ben Wyatt,But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff."
Tom Haverford,Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mind-numbingly dull.
Ben Wyatt,Dull?
Ben Wyatt,Does this look dull to you?
Tom Haverford,Ahhhh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so incredibly sorry.
Extra,"That's very kind of you, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"Thanks for coming, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I knew we were besties.
Jeremy Jamm,"What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.
Jeremy Jamm,Whatever.
Jeremy Jamm,Got a lotta filth in my kindle anyway.
Jeremy Jamm,We can just hang.
Jeremy Jamm,Wanna come up?
Leslie Knope,What?
Mike Patterson,We gotta get this.
Extra,Roll camera.
Mike Patterson,Tell me when.
Mike Patterson,Is my hair okay?
Mike Patterson,We good?
Mike Patterson,"Welcome to Eagleton Now, with Mike Patterson."
Mike Patterson,"We're live ambushing Leslie Knope who's in the middle of a crass publicity stunt, shoving cameras cameras into the faces of these poor, injured victims."
Leslie Knope,These are your cameras.
Leslie Knope,This is not a publicity stunt.
Leslie Knope,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.
Mike Patterson,Really?
Mike Patterson,"Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm."
Jeremy Jamm,"Excuse me, Mike."
Jeremy Jamm,"That's, uh, best friend."
Leslie Knope,Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you."
Jeremy Jamm,"Awesome idea, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,It was my idea.
Mike Patterson,You heard it here first.
Mike Patterson,Self-proclaimed dumbass Leslie Knope and councilman Jeremy Jamm are spearheading a Pawnee secession movement.
Mike Patterson,"And I, for one, am sick of it."
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, Eagleton, enough!"
Jeremy Jamm,Get these cameras outta here!
Extra,"Don't touch my camera, you Pawnee animal!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Namecalling, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Classy move, douche bag."
Mike Patterson,Oh!
Mike Patterson,All right.
Mike Patterson,Is that how you wanna play?
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah!
Jeremy Jamm,Come on!
Leslie Knope,No fighting in a hospital.
Leslie Knope,There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!
Jeremy Jamm,Wish I had my ninja stars!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Motherâ¦ puncher!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, girl."
Leslie Knope,What up?
April Ludgate,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,It's to distract people from my black eye.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,It's working.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,"Um well, there is some good news."
April Ludgate,"That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting."
Leslie Knope,How is any of that good news?
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.
April Ludgate,Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.
April Ludgate,They're just shouting louder than everyone else.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.
April Ludgate,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, April."
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a challenge."
Leslie Knope,"It's just like a big, fun... stinking turd nugget."
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, everything sucks."
Leslie Knope,Everything I try with this merger backfires.
Leslie Knope,I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you're also wearing a tie-dye tshirt."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes!"
Leslie Knope,I am!
Leslie Knope,Wonderful!
Tom Haverford,Mitch!
Tom Haverford,Thanks for meeting me.
Mitch Savner,My pleasure.
Mitch Savner,It's not often that I see someone with your sparkle and passion.
Mitch Savner,That's what makes businesses work-- passion!
Mitch Savner,"So Mr. Haverford, let's get to it."
Mitch Savner,What idea are you passionate about?
Tom Haverford,"I've got two words for you-- ""Tom's Bistro,"" an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant."
Tom Haverford,"Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting."
Mitch Savner,"Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?"""
Tom Haverford,Ben! You brought the wrong easel.
Tom Haverford,God! Can't take this guy anywhere.
Tom Haverford,Let me paint you a picture.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I had to reschedule.
Leslie Knope,It's been kind of a hectic week.
Grant Larson,What happened to your face?
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.
Grant Larson,"I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this week just keeps getting better and better."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.
Grant Larson,I came here because I wanted to meet you.
Grant Larson,I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.
Leslie Knope,Really? You know who I am?
Grant Larson,Yes.
Grant Larson,You're the person who wrote this.
Leslie Knope,You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.
Grant Larson,Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.
Grant Larson,"Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy."
Leslie Knope,Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!
Grant Larson,This report is legendary.
Grant Larson,It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that."
Leslie Knope,But you're a little late.
Leslie Knope,The river cleanup's well underway.
Grant Larson,This is bigger than the river cleanup.
Grant Larson,We're opening a new office in Chicago.
Grant Larson,I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.
Grant Larson,"Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service?"
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon."
Mitch Savner,Bacon pillows.
Mitch Savner,I like the sound of that.
Mitch Savner,"But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky."
Mitch Savner,Most of them are dead on arrival.
Ben Wyatt,"We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out."
Ben Wyatt,"See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town."
Ben Wyatt,"And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end."
Mitch Savner,"Okay! As long as you're running, I'm in."
Tom Haverford,Amazing!
Mitch Savner,"Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,I come here to think sometimes.
Leslie Knope,By myself.
Leslie Knope,But now that you're hereâ¦
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it."
Ron Swanson,"That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation."
Ron Swanson,But that feels unlikely.
Leslie Knope,"Look, you know how much I love Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.
Leslie Knope,"They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger."
Leslie Knope,They literally punch me in the face.
Leslie Knope,"And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with me?
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator."
Ron Swanson,"Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem."
Ron Swanson,"This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, man, you are lucky."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What the hell? I need your help.
Ron Swanson,"By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird."
Ron Swanson,"Now, to most people, this story would seem boring."
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,It's a story about a radiator.
Ron Swanson,"But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators."
Ron Swanson,"You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have."
Ron Swanson,"You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle."
Ron Swanson,"I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work."
Leslie Knope,He is a beautiful boy.
Ron Swanson,He's quite a looker.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,Clearing my throat.
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking about your offer.
Leslie Knope,And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.
Grant Larson,That's great! I'll start drawing up the paperwork.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it."
Grant Larson,"Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me."
Leslie Knope,And I won't know until I finish what I've started.
Leslie Knope,When do you need your answer?
Grant Larson,"Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time."
Grant Larson,But we can't wait forever.
Grant Larson,I'll be in touch.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's not your hand.
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up."
Ben Wyatt,"Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there."
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,"But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals."
Ben Wyatt,"To each his own, I guess."
Tom Haverford,"I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work."
Tom Haverford,I know I can!
Ben Wyatt,Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford,"I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000."
Tom Haverford,"So as of now, you own zero shares."
Ben Wyatt,Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.
Ben Wyatt,"Now go do work, or I will fire you."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.
Tom Haverford,Yep!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look, John."
Ron Swanson,It's red pine.
Ron Swanson,They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.
Ron Swanson,"Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep]."
Ron Swanson,"This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me."
Ron Swanson,He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.
Ron Swanson,Or he pooped.
Ron Swanson,"Either way, well done, John."
