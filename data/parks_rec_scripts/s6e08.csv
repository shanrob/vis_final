Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"No, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Ben Wyatt,I got fired from running the Sweetums Foundation.
Leslie Knope,Thanks to me.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, again."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, blessing in disguise."
Ben Wyatt,"I took a job at this accounting firm, they've tried to hire me three times, I finally gave in."
Ben Wyatt,"But I've had a week off in between jobs, and I've been cooking up something pretty big."
Leslie Knope,"The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully."
Ben Wyatt,"Presenting ""The Cones of Dunshire,"" a brand new gaming experience."
Ben Wyatt,"Two wizards, a Maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the ledgerman just keeps score, and he wears this hat."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the object is to accumulate cones."
Ben Wyatt,"Four cones wins, but in order to get a cone, you have to build a civilization."
Ben Wyatt,The other amazing thing is the challenge play.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, let me tell you more about the trivia cards, 'cause you're gonna need to know about roadblocks first."
Ben Wyatt,"Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt,The thing about the challenge play is that it's basically the gameâ¦ in reverse.
Ben Wyatt,Then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, 16."
Ben Wyatt,"Perfect, lots of choices."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each turn goes: Roll, buy, action."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, this would be much taller in the real game."
Ben Wyatt,But the corporal can veto.
Ben Wyatt,This should be green too.
Ben Wyatt,How did this happen?
Ben Wyatt,Are the cones a metaphor?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, yes and no."
Leslie Knope,What is this called again?
Ben Wyatt,"""The Cones of Dunshire."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, the Maverick should be able to trade lumber for agriculture credits."
Ben Wyatt,How have I not thought of this before?
Ben Wyatt,"This is nothing, right?"
Leslie Knope,When do you go back to work again?
Ben Wyatt,Tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,It's fine.
Ben Wyatt,I'll just throw this in the garbage.
Jeremy Jamm,"As soon as Knope is gone, these are going up all over Chambers."
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm for three!
Leslie Knope,Ha ha!
Leslie Knope,"What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?"
Councilman Milton,Ooh!
Councilman Milton,The girl is attacking me.
Councilman Howser,Any new business before we adjourn?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have one the Pawnee Commons."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project is currently in a discretionary fund."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project."
Jeremy Jamm,"The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is it's not really up to you anymore."
Jeremy Jamm,"Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot."
Jeremy Jamm,"But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl."
Jeremy Jamm,"What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, now I do."
Jeremy Jamm,"I propose that we table this discussion until, let's say, the second Knope is gone."
Jeremy Jamm,"Later, bunheads."
Jeremy Jamm,Glass!
Tom Haverford,Video Ron demand.
Tom Haverford,"What you carrying, my dude?"
Ron Swanson,The time has come to sell my cabin.
Ron Swanson,But I haven't had much luck finding a buyer.
April Ludgate,"""For sale."""
April Ludgate,"""Small house."""
April Ludgate,"""Location: Forest."""
April Ludgate,"It's a little wordy, don't you think?"
Donna Meagle,"""Current owner will not clean up shotgun shells or animal carcasses."""
Donna Meagle,"The hell is wrong with you, Swanson?"
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I'll clean up the shotgun shells, but the carcasses remain to fertilize my berry patch."
Donna Meagle,"If you really want to unload that little horror cabin, you gonna need a professional to stage it properly."
Donna Meagle,"Lucky for you, I recently got my real estate license."
Donna Meagle,Spladow!
Donna Meagle,Check it.
Ron Swanson,"""Regal Meagle Realty."""
Ron Swanson,"""Find your castle."""
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I suppose I could use some help."
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Donna, let me get a little skin in the game, maybe split that commission?"
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Show me what you got.
Donna Meagle,I'll split that commish.
Donna Meagle,Split that commish
Tom Haverford,Split that commish
Tom Haverford,"The question I always ask myself is, what kind of mogul should I be?"
Tom Haverford,"Fashion mogul, energy drink mogul."
Tom Haverford,I even thought about downhill skiing.
Tom Haverford,A mogul mogul.
Tom Haverford,But a real estate mogul?
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,That's a hot mogul right now.
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty."
Ben Wyatt,"How you doing, Barney?"
Ben Wyatt,Good to see you again.
Barney,I just can't believe it's finally happening.
Barney,Ted!
Barney,He's here!
Barney,He really came!
Frank,"Hello, Ben."
Frank,I'm Frank.
Frank,I took the job when you passed it up last time.
Frank,Heard a lot about you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all good things, I hope."
Frank,A little too good.
Frank,Let's see if you live up to the hype.
Frank,I'm not joking.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Frank seems cool.
Leslie Knope,"Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the father of your child is here."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,I'll talk to you soon.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Chris Traeger,Was that Ann?
Chris Traeger,I hope you were speaking to her in a calming voice 'cause babies can hear everything.
Chris Traeger,"Baby, if you can still hear me, I love you."
Leslie Knope,The phone is hung up.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, but as city manager, I can't play sides."
Chris Traeger,And I think all of our heads can be a little dinky at times.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, but his is the dinkiest."
Leslie Knope,And I would know because I'm keeping score.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since I started city council, I have gone head-to-head with Jamm 112 times."
Leslie Knope,"He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times."
Leslie Knope,I will not lose our last battle.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way."
Chris Traeger,"No, I can't help directly, but I am on your side."
Chris Traeger,And I will assist you in any way that I can.
Chris Traeger,"Maybe I can mediate, like Dr. Phil, only qualified."
Tom Haverford,"So what's the story, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Diane making you sell this place?
Ron Swanson,Not at all.
Ron Swanson,"Recently, I purchased a new cabin big enough for the whole family."
Ron Swanson,I just can't justify owning four cabins.
Ron Swanson,Two cabins.
Ron Swanson,"The new cabin I bought has a great tire swing for the girls, access to a lake for all the kids to play in."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it doesn't have these razorsharp perimeter defense planks sticking out of the ground."
Donna Meagle,"I usually get a 5% commission, but I'll do it for 3%."
Donna Meagle,Friends and family discount.
Ron Swanson,Make it 5%.
Ron Swanson,I don't want you getting any ideas about us being friends.
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, baby."
Tom Haverford,"For the fireplace, I'm thinking fake antlers."
Tom Haverford,But what kind of scarves do we want to hang off the fake antlers?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, duh."
Tom Haverford,Crocheted.
Donna Meagle,Most def.
Donna Meagle,"That'll look legit next to those antique ""Visit France"" posters."
Tom Haverford,Mm.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you want to stay outside and do nothing while they make your cabin look like garbage?"
Ron Swanson,I'd like that very much.
Ron Swanson,We can watch the shadows get longer.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you guys sure take the startup paperwork seriously around here."
Barney,"Sorry to start you out like this, and on a Friday no less."
Barney,But it's our toughest case.
Barney,"Three competing family trusts, a contested will-- it's a real puzzler!"
Frank,"So let's see what you got, genius."
Ben Wyatt,"If I'm murdered tonight, start the investigation with those two guys."
Jeremy Jamm,The hell you nerds doing here?
Leslie Knope,We're not done talking about the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,This isn't over.
Chris Traeger,And I am here to mediate.
Jeremy Jamm,You can't just show up at my door like this.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.
Jeremy Jamm,"I respect the moxie, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,You can come in for a minute.
Jeremy Jamm,Shoes off.
Jeremy Jamm,This is a house of respect.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't need to do that."
Chris Traeger,My feet are very clean.
Jeremy Jamm,"No shoes, you lose."
Leslie Knope,"""No shoes, you lose""?"
Leslie Knope,"That means we should have shoes then, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,No shoes... Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, so this is my weekend dojo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess."
Jeremy Jamm,My wife's in Oklahoma for eight months.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe forever.
Jeremy Jamm,We'll see if she forgives me.
Leslie Knope,"Who's that, Michelle Wie?"
Jeremy Jamm,It's not sexual.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just a really big fan of her game.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, thanks."
Jeremy Jamm,Photoshopped it myself.
Leslie Knope,Fantastic.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so"
Leslie Knope,Why don't we all hit the hay?
Leslie Knope,"We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.
Leslie Knope,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY."
Leslie Knope,"The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, playing hardball, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, no sweat off my sack."
Jeremy Jamm,"You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way."
Leslie Knope,I think I can handle it.
Jeremy Jamm,"How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,I got it from an actual benihana.
Jeremy Jamm,Cost me 4 grand.
Jeremy Jamm,Worth every penny.
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Jeremy Jamm,Can I interest anyone in an authentic Japanese abreakafast?
Leslie Knope,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Leslie Knope,"You know, maybe we should negotiate while we're eating."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, what's the rush?"
Jeremy Jamm,Plenty of time for that later.
Leslie Knope,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"Knope, you know the way to a man's heart."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, okay."
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk.
Jeremy Jamm,You got it.
Ron Swanson,These people won't leave.
Ron Swanson,One guy even looked in the bathroom.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, that means they like the place."
Donna Meagle,"If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers."
Tom Haverford,This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.
Ron Swanson,You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.
Tom Haverford,"Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them."
Extra,This place is so random.
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,"It's kind of, like, in the middle of nowhere."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"That's, like, the hilarious part."
April Ludgate,It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.
April Ludgate,It's like a meta-cabin.
Extra,Oh yeah.
Extra,"That's what I thought, yeah."
April Ludgate,I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.
Extra,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.
Ron Swanson,Carry on.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once."
Extra,What?
Barney,Saturday at the firm with Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we dissolve the loanout and file bankruptcy."
Ben Wyatt,That way only our clients have claim to the assets.
Frank,Great idea that we had a month ago.
Frank,"The problem is, the trust still has claim to the property."
Ben Wyatt,Then we dissolve the trust.
Ben Wyatt,"Clients ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""F,"" they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate."
Frank,He's right.
Frank,We never thought of that.
Barney,"Oh, oh!"
Barney,"Ben, Ben."
Barney,"Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea."
Ben Wyatt,"Sure, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm with you."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, okay."
Ben Wyatt,What if we dissolve the trust?
Barney,Yes!
Barney,You just cracked the case.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just doing my job.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we name part of the park the ""Jamm Zone""?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, Jamm could dig on that."
Jeremy Jamm,"How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?"
Chris Traeger,"Caution, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,"I think there are people that will find the ""No Married Chicks"" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce."
Jeremy Jamm,All right.
Jeremy Jamm,"Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans."
Jeremy Jamm,Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.
Jeremy Jamm,"You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.
Leslie Knope,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ugh, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, I'm getting bored."
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, we've been at this for hours."
Jeremy Jamm,Can we please take a break?
Chris Traeger,Perhaps he has a point.
Chris Traeger,And we've made some progress.
Chris Traeger,Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait until Monday."
Leslie Knope,I need to close this deal now.
Leslie Knope,So I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.
Leslie Knope,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?"
Jeremy Jamm,I do.
Jeremy Jamm,And kudos on that pronunciation.
Leslie Knope,I remembered your favorite duet.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no, no, no."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm Sandra Dee.
Jeremy Jamm,That's more of my register.
Jeremy Jamm,You're Zuko.
Jeremy Jamm,"He got friendly, holdin' my hand"
Leslie Knope,She got friendly down in the sand
Jeremy Jamm,"He was sweet, just turned 18"
Leslie Knope,"Well, she was good, you know what I mean?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Leslie Knope,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Chris Traeger,I would like to buy five DVDs of this.
Chris Traeger,"No, 20."
Chris Traeger,"No, 60!"
Chris Traeger,"No, that's insane."
Leslie Knope,Dubee doo dubee doo dubee dubee dubee dow
Tom Haverford,Good news.
Tom Haverford,We have multiple bidders.
Tom Haverford,That guy's getting his financials together.
Tom Haverford,"Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land."
Ron Swanson,Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?
Donna Meagle,"I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glampground."
Donna Meagle,"Glamping is ""glamour camping."""
Donna Meagle,"Heated tents, catered meals, wifi"
Ron Swanson,You're describing a hotel.
Tom Haverford,And I think we still have traction with those two.
Extra,"Oh, hey, man."
Extra,I love the mustache.
Extra,So funny.
Extra,"You ever think about twisting it up at the ends, huh?"
Extra,Use a little beeswax?
Ron Swanson,The open house is now closed.
Ron Swanson,We are not accepting bids at this time.
Ron Swanson,The sun sets in 95 minutes.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Tom Haverford,That's part of the charm of this whole place-- the cantankerous old coot who owns it.
Tom Haverford,It's authentic!
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there."
Leslie Knope,"We have fun when we collaborate, right?"
Leslie Knope,Working together?
Leslie Knope,"Lockbox, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Jeremy Jamm,You are my Nemesis.
Jeremy Jamm,You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.
Leslie Knope,You want to be Lex Luthor?
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,Lex Luthor is rich.
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,I can't argue with that.
Leslie Knope,So I did Zuko for you.
Leslie Knope,Now you give me the lockbox.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,Time for you to head it in.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,What can I say?
Jeremy Jamm,You wore me down.
Jeremy Jamm,"I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out."
Jeremy Jamm,We won't touch the money for one year.
Jeremy Jamm,"And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have your lockbox."
Chris Traeger,And you scored a triple dragon on your song.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait a year."
Leslie Knope,I want to get started now.
Leslie Knope,I want construction started on Monday.
Chris Traeger,You have his word.
Chris Traeger,"And this is riddled with spelling errors, but it is binding."
Leslie Knope,It's not good enough!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad"
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you don't.
Leslie Knope,"I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?"
Leslie Knope,Screw you!
Leslie Knope,You're giving a card to me?
Chris Traeger,You left me no choice.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Chris Traeger,"Please, could you excuse us?"
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you should be happy!"
Chris Traeger,You beat Jamm in the final battle.
Chris Traeger,Unless there's something more going on here.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,This is about Ann.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Chris Traeger,I love Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.
Leslie Knope,And I know you guys are talking about moving.
Leslie Knope,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might... she might want to stay."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.
Chris Traeger,She went to sign the lease on our new home.
Leslie Knope,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.
Chris Traeger,She already has family there.
Chris Traeger,And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.
Chris Traeger,Go blue!
Chris Traeger,It's a good town.
Chris Traeger,And it's a great place to raise a family.
Leslie Knope,What is great about it?
Leslie Knope,There's no JJ's Diner there.
Leslie Knope,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!"
Leslie Knope,It's ridiculous.
Jeremy Jamm,"Unexpected play here, Superman."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit."
Leslie Knope,"There is no Gambit here, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.
Jeremy Jamm,I haven't seen it.
Jeremy Jamm,Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.
Jeremy Jamm,I find his voice very grating.
Leslie Knope,I am leaving now.
Leslie Knope,I am not moving.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going home.
Jeremy Jamm,Are you guys coming back to my place?
Jeremy Jamm,What's what's or are you guys going back to... we wrapping up the weekend?
Jeremy Jamm,No?
Ben Wyatt,Need a cup to perk me up coffee in the morning
All,Surprise!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Barney,I hope you don't mind.
Barney,We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,See what we got here.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,That's not pizza.
Ben Wyatt,Those are calzones!
Ben Wyatt,I love calzones!
Barney,We know!
Ben Wyatt,I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, guys?"
All,Hey!
Chris Traeger,BFF slideshow?
Chris Traeger,"You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend."
Chris Traeger,And it's not that long a trip.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee to Ann arbor bullet train idea."
Chris Traeger,"You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna get that lockbox.
Leslie Knope,And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.
Leslie Knope,"It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams."
Chris Traeger,I have an idea.
Chris Traeger,And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.
Donna Meagle,"No, thank you."
Donna Meagle,I will let him know.
Donna Meagle,That was that couple you liked at the open house.
Ron Swanson,I despised them.
Donna Meagle,"Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up."
Donna Meagle,Way over asking price.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, who cares who they are? That's a massive bid."
Tom Haverford,I'ma be a mogul.
Ron Swanson,I bought that cabin 18 years go for 2000 dollars. I do not care about the money.
Tom Haverford,I can't even understand what you're saying right now.
Ron Swanson,"That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life."
Ron Swanson,I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.
Ron Swanson,"Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell."
April Ludgate,I'll buy it.
Tom Haverford,You can't afford that house.
Tom Haverford,Can you afford that house?
Ron Swanson,What would you use it for?
April Ludgate,I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders.
April Ludgate,And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them.
April Ludgate,Here's my offer.
April Ludgate,I will give you everything in my purse.
April Ludgate,"8 dollars, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler."
Jerry Gergich,Thank God.
Jerry Gergich,I've been looking for that.
April Ludgate,"Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now."
April Ludgate,You have no legal claim to it.
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, I had no idea."
Ron Swanson,This is the best offer I've heard yet.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you tripping right now."
Ron Swanson,Sold.
Donna Meagle,Don't even trip.
Ron Swanson,Your commission.
Donna Meagle,Thanks a lot.
Donna Meagle,"Your share, mogul."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good."
Chris Traeger,"You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket."
Chris Traeger,"Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.O.U., no questions asked."
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm likes the sound of that.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's make it five I.O.U.s, and you got a deal."
Chris Traeger,"You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice."
Chris Traeger,Fine.
Chris Traeger,Five huge IOUs.
Jeremy Jamm,"Deal, guys."
Jeremy Jamm,You must really want that park.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend."
Jeremy Jamm,That's all I wanted to hear.
Jeremy Jamm,"Leslie, you're my best friend too."
Leslie Knope,"Well, vote passed."
Leslie Knope,3-2.
Leslie Knope,Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.
Leslie Knope,Are you sure you're okay with what you did?
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope."
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Chris Traeger,And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening."
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining."
Chris Traeger,The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.
Chris Traeger,"And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job."
Ben Wyatt,Wh-- Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Is this for realskis?
Chris Traeger,This is 100% certified for realskis.
Chris Traeger,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I-- wow."
Ben Wyatt,I would be insane to say no.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Barney,"Wyatt, you're late."
Barney,"I'm just kidding, you can do whatever you want."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Barney, I'm afraid I have some bad news."
Ben Wyatt,Today's my last day.
Ben Wyatt,"I got an opportunity I couldn't say no to, and I have to quit."
Ben Wyatt,Again.
Barney,No need to explain.
Barney,I knew it was too good to be true.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I do have a little going-away gift."
Ben Wyatt,Left it in the break room.
Ben Wyatt,"If anyone could appreciate it, it's you guys."
Barney,"""You can play with one warrior, but it's just not nearly as good."""
Barney,Enjoy.
Barney,Ben Wyatt.
Barney,Let's play.
Extra,I call ledgerman! No.
