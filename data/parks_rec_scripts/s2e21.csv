Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I run something by you really quick?"
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,I love having things run by me.
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like you're being sarcastic right now.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,I genuinely love it.
Leslie Knope,Run it by me.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead!
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, so I've been a little worried that Ann maybe thinks that our relationship isn't moving forward fast enough."
Mark Brendanawicz,And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her if she would like to move in with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Good idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,Bad idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is--"
Mark Brendanawicz,I intend to marry her.
Leslie Knope,For realskies?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really quite sure how I feel.
Leslie Knope,I-- It's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm happy for them."
Leslie Knope,They're my friends.
Leslie Knope,It makes me a little nauseous.
Leslie Knope,"If I could just sum it up in one word, it would beâ¦ ohâ¦"
April Ludgate,Parks and Rec.
April Ludgate,Confirming what?
April Ludgate,That's not possible.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Good morning.
April Ludgate,Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?
April Ludgate,"So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?"
April Ludgate,"That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st."
Ron Swanson,Why?
April Ludgate,Because I didn't think March 31st existed.
April Ludgate,"Thirty days has September, April, March and November--"
Ron Swanson,June and November.
Ron Swanson,Today is March 31st.
April Ludgate,I know.
Ron Swanson,"So, then, how many meetings do I have today?"
April Ludgate,93
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you know what to do."
April Ludgate,Right.
Ron Swanson,"To me, this situation is a bloodsoaked, nightmarish hellscape."
Ron Swanson,"However, to Leslie Knopeâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, how fun!"
April Ludgate,Yay!
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you take as many as you can, and I'll cover the rest."
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100"
Ron Swanson,Just-- Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect distraction for me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have everything I need, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy furlined boots."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna need those boots back by the end of the day.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no problem."
Leslie Knope,They're actually a little narrow for me.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, here's a guy."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director."
Bill Haggerty,"Bill Haggerty, Pawnee Historical Society."
Bill Haggerty,I'm supposed to be meeting with Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,I understand that.
Leslie Knope,He's tied up right now.
Bill Haggerty,What a shocker.
Bill Haggerty,"I've been trying to meet with him for three months, and now he's not available."
Bill Haggerty,"It's probably too late now, but, some rich woman, Jessica Wicks, has rented out Turnbill Mansion for a party, and she's making alterations."
Leslie Knope,"""Alterations""?"
Leslie Knope,Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief."
Leslie Knope,The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.
Leslie Knope,"But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath."
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, there were two survivors."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, they were both horses."
Tom Haverford,Hold up.
Tom Haverford,Former beauty queen Jessica Wicks?
Bill Haggerty,Yes.
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna be running point on this, Bill."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?"
Bill Haggerty,Her husband is Nick Newport Sr. from Sweetums.
Bill Haggerty,Everyone in this town is afraid to say no to him.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody just relax."
Leslie Knope,What alterations is she trying to make?
Leslie Knope,"Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,She's what?
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get the car."
Tom Haverford,Ow!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Don't throw things at me.
Leslie Knope,"God, these are tight!"
Extra,I'll devise an action plan to help us coordinate better among the departments.
Ron Swanson,Will you?
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,Thanks for coming in.
Extra,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'll meet you at the car."
Ron Swanson,Where the hell are you going?
Ron Swanson,We have 91 more meetings!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the ""all-time City Hall single day meetings record,"" there is an emergency."
Leslie Knope,Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I can't hang out.
Leslie Knope,I kind of have an emergency.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm actually here to see Mark."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thanks for the coffee."
Ann Perkins,That's also for Mark.
Leslie Knope,"I really need it, though."
Leslie Knope,"But next time more sugar, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, bye."
April Ludgate,Do you want me to postpone the rest?
April Ludgate,Or I could set myself on fire and create a diversion?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna do all of these today.
Ron Swanson,Round up whoever's free.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,It's gorgeous.
Leslie Knope,What kind of monster would wanna change this?
Tom Haverford,Pre-zit.
Tom Haverford,Do you have any brown concealer by any chance?
Tom Haverford,I need to look good for Jessica.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,I'm right behind you.
Tom Haverford,I just need to spend a minute in my cologne cloud.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Tom Haverford,Attack by Dennis Feinstein.
Tom Haverford,When you wanna attack the senses of the lady you wanna bed.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,"Door, door!"
Tom Haverford,Close it!
Ron Swanson,"So basically, we're completely swamped."
Ron Swanson,All hands on deck.
Ann Perkins,I don't even work in this building.
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Ann Perkins,I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, do you need help with anything?"
Ron Swanson,"No, we're good."
Ron Swanson,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, you can head home early."
Ron Swanson,"Right, now the four of us are gonna divvy up all these meetings."
Ron Swanson,Just make them feel like they've been heard.
Ron Swanson,Understood?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case."
Ron Swanson,"April, you take Leslie's office."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, you're in the conference room."
Ron Swanson,"Ann, take your meetings in the courtyard."
Ron Swanson,Just sit there and don't ruin the city.
Ron Swanson,Dismissed.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,Can I get a badge?
April Ludgate,"Hey, I brought you a coffee, help you get through the day."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, dude!"
April Ludgate,"No problem, lady!"
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,April is the best but she's 20.
Andy Dwyer,"When April was born, I was already in third grade, which means if we were friends back then, I'd have been hanging out with a baby."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know anything about infant care.
Andy Dwyer,"My God, I could have killed her!"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, Mr. Newport Sr. I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion."
Leslie Knope,"And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure."
Nick Newport Sr.,What?
Jessica Wicks,"I'll take care of this, love nut."
Nick Newport Sr.,Biscuit.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,"Hi, I'm Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, yes."
Leslie Knope,We've met before.
Leslie Knope,We were both judges at the pageant last year.
Jessica Wicks,Leslie Knorp.
Jessica Wicks,Of course!
Jessica Wicks,How are you?
Tom Haverford,Jessica Wicks.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, boo!"
Tom Haverford,Are you aging in reverse?
Tom Haverford,'Cause you look barely legal.
Jessica Wicks,Tom Haverford.
Jessica Wicks,If you're not the most charming man in Indiana.
Tom Haverford,And this must be the luckiest man in Indiana.
Tom Haverford,"Sir, it is an honor to meet you."
Tom Haverford,"Come here, you!"
Nick Newport Sr.,"Tell me straight, are you a Chinese?"
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I'm one of the Indian people.
Tom Haverford,That floppy old bag of money is gonna be dead in like a month.
Tom Haverford,And who's going to comfort Jessica and her millions of dollars?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Jessica is a gold digger."
Tom Haverford,But I'm a gold digger digger.
Tom Haverford,"So, how did you and Mr. Newport meet?"
Jessica Wicks,"I was doing a ribbon cutting at the hospital, and he was there because his blood doesn't work."
Jessica Wicks,"And we started talking, and then I realized who he was."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my gosh!"
Jessica Wicks,It was love at first sight!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party."
Leslie Knope,"But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Jessica Wicks,"It's a little late for that, sweetheart."
Jessica Wicks,I told them what I was doing months ago.
Jessica Wicks,"Where I come from, there's a saying, ""What's done is done."""
Leslie Knope,That's a saying everywhere.
Tom Haverford,I've never heard it before and I think it's a great saying.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we can just limit the damage."
Leslie Knope,How much have you done?
Leslie Knope,You painted this?
Jessica Wicks,Uh-huh.
Jessica Wicks,Miami Teal is Nicky's favorite color.
Jessica Wicks,"We also replaced some of the sconces, got rid of the furniture, painted these floors black."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,These were the original hardwood floors.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,They were all scratched up.
Jessica Wicks,I did you a favor.
Jessica Wicks,Come on in here.
Jessica Wicks,I'll show you guys what we did in the sitting room.
Leslie Knope,I can't--
Tom Haverford,After you.
Tom Haverford,I'd hate to miss the view.
Jessica Wicks,You little devil.
Jessica Wicks,I should just pay you to follow me around.
Tom Haverford,"If that's a job offer, I accept."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?
Jessica Wicks,To hang my birthday present to Nicky.
Tom Haverford,My heavens!
Leslie Knope,"Isn't there a way that you could've-- Oh, my!"
Leslie Knope,History is important.
Leslie Knope,You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.
Leslie Knope,"Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so angry, I can't think of another color."
Leslie Knope,Green.
Mel,"So, your department banned me from attending games just because I yell ""you suck"" at the players!"
Ron Swanson,"According to the complaint, you yelled it at five year old girls."
Mel,Who suck!
Mel,Why is that so hard to understand?
Extra,I thought I was having this meeting with Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's currently dead.
Extra,Oh.
April Ludgate,"I'm his daughter, April Swanson."
April Ludgate,And it's his last wish that I have this meeting with you.
Extra,"I represent the Ultimate Frisbee league, and--"
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee has an Ultimate league?
Extra,"Yes, and we keep running into conflicts with--"
Andy Dwyer,You won me over.
Andy Dwyer,I will join your team.
Extra,"I'm sorry, what we need--"
Andy Dwyer,When does practice start?
Andy Dwyer,And do you provide the jerseys?
Andy Dwyer,"What color are the jerseys, by the way?"
Andy Dwyer,What's our team name?
Andy Dwyer,Are we the Lightning?
Ann Perkins,"Now, I have to tell you, I don't actually work in the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,I'm a nurse.
Extra,Seriously?
Extra,That's great news.
Extra,I have the weirdest thing on my arm.
Extra,Can you see this?
Ann Perkins,Every time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet."
Jessica Wicks,Don't remind me.
Jessica Wicks,The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.
Jessica Wicks,I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.
Leslie Knope,Ugly thing?
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you a little something about this ""ugly thing,"" ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families."
Leslie Knope,It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to destroy it?
Jessica Wicks,Don't tell me about Pawnee history.
Jessica Wicks,The Newports made this town.
Jessica Wicks,"And tonight, we're gonna celebrate my husband's 85th birthday, without this mushy old pile of rot."
Leslie Knope,Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.
Jessica Wicks,"You were a stick-in-the-mud when we judged that beauty pageant, and you're being a stick-in-the-mud now."
Leslie Knope,I am not a stick-in-the-mud!
Leslie Knope,I just want to stop a party from happening.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and emails."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I haven't relieved myself in five hours, so, if you'll excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait."
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks refuses to--
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what the [bleep]?"
Councilman Howser,Hey!
Councilman Howser,Miss Knope?
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser!
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,"Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the problem--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Ron Swanson,Enough of this.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever you want.
Ron Swanson,Alert the media.
Ron Swanson,"Call FEMA, I don't care."
Ron Swanson,Do not bother me with this again.
Councilman Howser,Miss Knope.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,I saw your penis.
Extra,There are eight swings at Ramsett Park and every single one of them is broken.
Extra,Can you please just fix one of them?
Andy Dwyer,Ron told me I can't say yes to anything.
Andy Dwyer,But it's such a reasonable request.
Andy Dwyer,I can't just say no.
Extra,"So, that's a yes?"
Extra,Are you saying yes?
Extra,"Just say out loud, yes or no."
Andy Dwyer,Boop!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they do look a little bit swollen."
Ann Perkins,Just follow the pen.
Ann Perkins,Follow the pen to--
Ann Perkins,Does that hurt?
Extra,There's no way this ordinance goes through.
Extra,There's too much red tape.
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,This gridlock drives me nuts.
Extra,Tell me about it.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I think you're gonna have to make an end run.
April Ludgate,You know?
April Ludgate,Go right to the Commissioner on this one.
Extra,"You know what, I hadn't thought of that."
Extra,That is a really great idea.
April Ludgate,Yeah?
Extra,I'm gonna do that.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Your last resort is probably gonna be City Council.
Extra,Good luck there!
April Ludgate,Yeah!
April Ludgate,My thoughts exactly.
April Ludgate,I have no idea what I was saying.
Extra,I ask you.
Extra,Is this too revealing for a public pool?
Ron Swanson,Kindly get your groin off my desk.
Extra,"So my body makes you uncomfortable, too?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm actually headed right out the door.
Leslie Knope,You're going on a date with Ann.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I was gonna surprise her, take her to a nice restaurant."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you sure now?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, have a good time."
Ron Swanson,How we doing?
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.
Andy Dwyer,I may have promised a new aquatic center to somebody.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a problem?
Ann Perkins,I diagnosed two melanomas.
Ann Perkins,They're both benign.
Ron Swanson,How many more meetings?
April Ludgate,Twenty.
Ron Swanson,April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson Castle.
Ron Swanson,Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
Ron Swanson,I hired you to do one thing.
Ron Swanson,Just one.
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you text all day and sleep at your desk.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, I encourage it."
Ron Swanson,But only because you were doing that one thing.
Ron Swanson,Keeping this crap off my desk.
Ron Swanson,Give me five minutes before the next one.
Ann Perkins,That guy is scary when he's angry.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,"God, I know."
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
April Ludgate,I don't need your sympathy.
April Ludgate,Or yours.
Ann Perkins,I wasn't offering my sympathy.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for meeting me here.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's up?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I need you to get this word for word.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a tape recorder.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So it will.
Leslie Knope,"""Gazebo?"""
Leslie Knope,"More like ""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,"She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!"""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, could you just maybe talk normally?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr. at the Turnbill Mansion tonight.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna stop you right there.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Nick Newport Sr. is the former CEO of Sweetums.
Leslie Knope,So?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sweetums owns The Pawnee Journal.
Leslie Knope,Crap on the cob!
Ron Swanson,I will take it into consideration.
Ron Swanson,Thank God!
Ron Swanson,"That was it, right?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,There's one more.
Ron Swanson,Damn it to hell!
April Ludgate,It's with me and it's right now and it's about me quitting.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Leslie Knope,"I have no other choice, okay?"
Leslie Knope,This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Here they come.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, throw away the key!"
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Throw it!
Extra,Out of the way!
Leslie Knope,"Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late."
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Tom! Stop him! Jump in front of it! Sacrifice your tiny body! I really thought that gate would open in the middle."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the gazebo has been destroyed."
Leslie Knope,And the thing that bothers me the most--
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Tom Haverford,It never gets old.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann and Mark are coming."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, not so close."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna-- You're gonna-- Don't go past the sensor.
Tom Haverford,Sensor.
Leslie Knope,Sorry if I ruined your evening.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's totally fine."
Leslie Knope,I chained myself to a gate.
Ann Perkins,I can see that.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Nothing's bruised but my ego.
Leslie Knope,"And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate."
Andy Dwyer,Thanks again for letting me take those meetings today.
Andy Dwyer,I've never really had a meeting before.
Andy Dwyer,They're awesome.
Ron Swanson,You're welcome.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, have you seen April around? She usually comes by at the end of the day."
Ron Swanson,You might want to check her house.
Ron Swanson,She quit on me.
Andy Dwyer,What? Why?
Ron Swanson,She screwed up my entire life today.
Andy Dwyer,That was one mistake.
Andy Dwyer,She's perfect for you.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, there's no one in the world who's gonna do a better job for you than April."
Andy Dwyer,Either you hire her back or I quit.
Ron Swanson,You don't work for me.
Andy Dwyer,"And I never will, sir."
Andy Dwyer,Good day.
Leslie Knope,So what'd you guys talk about at dinner? Huh? Was it fun? Any big decisions arrived at?
Ann Perkins,It was fine.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you need a ride home?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom's gonna take me."
Leslie Knope,You guys go on ahead.
Ann Perkins,I'm glad you're okay.
Ann Perkins,Call me tomorrow?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Bye, Leslie."
Larry Ludgate,"Well, hello there."
Larry Ludgate,You must be Ron Swanson.
Larry Ludgate,"Well, welcome to Casa Ludgate!"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Mr. Ludgate."
Larry Ludgate,Call me Larry.
Rita Ludgate,"Larry, who is it?"
Larry Ludgate,It's Zuzu's boss.
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, Ron."
Rita Ludgate,Rita Ludgate.
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, you have no idea how nice it is to meet you."
Rita Ludgate,"Come in, for gosh sake."
Rita Ludgate,What can I get you to drink? Ooh.
Rita Ludgate,"Could you take your shoes off, please?"
Rita Ludgate,Thank you so much.
Ron Swanson,"Nothing to drink, thanks."
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, okay."
Ron Swanson,Is April around?
Larry Ludgate,"Zuzu, you have a guest."
Rita Ludgate,I'll fetch her.
Rita Ludgate,She's probably on the Internet again!
Larry Ludgate,I'll come with you.
Rita Ludgate,Okay.
Rita Ludgate,Okay.
Larry Ludgate,"You make yourself at home, Mr. Swanson."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You must be April's sister.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron.
Ron Swanson,Nice to meet you.
Tom Haverford,"No offense, but I think the normal grieving time for gazebo destruction has passed."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, maybe that's not entirely what I'm upset about."
Leslie Knope,Mark and Ann are gonna get married.
Tom Haverford,Really? Why does that bother you?
Tom Haverford,I should be the one that's upset.
Tom Haverford,It was supposed to be me and Ann.
Tom Haverford,Or me and Jessica.
Tom Haverford,Or Ann and Jessica with me watching.
Leslie Knope,"Every time a couple gets married, two single people die."
Leslie Knope,I'm about to lose two good friends.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,They drove over here and cut you down from a gate.
Tom Haverford,I really don't think you have to worry about them abandoning you once they get married.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know that."
Leslie Knope,In my brain.
Tom Haverford,Can we go?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,I just need toâ¦
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,No!
Leslie Knope,...do one more thing.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no!"
Jessica Wicks,"Loving smiles and smiling tears, The midnight of my heart is you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I need to say something."
Extra,Is that Gate Lady?
Leslie Knope,"I know you're probably thinking, ""There's that crazy gate lady from outside back again."""
Leslie Knope,"And to some extent, you're right."
Leslie Knope,I am the gate lady.
Leslie Knope,But the only thing I'm crazy about is leaving the past behind.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to apologize and raise a glass to change and forgiveness and the future and Ann and Mark, and happiness and Nick Newport Sr."
Leslie Knope,May all your future gazebos live long and prosper.
Jessica Wicks,Please leave!
Leslie Knope,Is it weird if I ask to take a piece of cake with me? I won't.
Jessica Wicks,Go.
April Ludgate,Why are you here?
Ron Swanson,Come back to work.
April Ludgate,No.
Ron Swanson,Come back.
Ron Swanson,I want you to come back.
April Ludgate,"Well, I don't want to come back."
April Ludgate,The end.
Ron Swanson,"I was talking to Andy about you, and he made me realize that I need you back at work."
April Ludgate,What did he say?
Ron Swanson,Don't recall.
April Ludgate,"Fine, I'll come back."
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, I'm leaving."
Ron Swanson,"Bye, Zuzu."
April Ludgate,"Bye, Duke Silver."
April Ludgate,My mom has all your albums.
April Ludgate,I recognized you the day we met.
Ron Swanson,Have you told anyone?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Good girl.
Extra,"Well, excuse me."
Extra,"I had a meeting with Ron Swanson yesterday, but had a little car trouble."
April Ludgate,"Sorry, he's busy right now."
Extra,"Well, can I reschedule?"
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,How about June 50th?
Extra,Sorry?
April Ludgate,Do you think you could come back today at 2:65? He's available then.
Extra,What is going on?
April Ludgate,Looks like the only other day he has open is Marchtember One Teenth.
April Ludgate,"Does that work, sir?"
