Character,Line
Chris Traeger,Tom!
Chris Traeger,I would like you to redesign our Parks department logo.
Tom Haverford,Sounds cool so far.
Chris Traeger,"Rethink our visual brand, take these words, and make something amazing."
Tom Haverford,So you're saying you want me to choose a new font.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, essentially I'd like you to choose a new font. Jerry, I am making you my number two guy on the new font project."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, that's too close."
Tom Haverford,Let's make him a number three.
Chris Traeger,Fair enough.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, you're number three."
Jerry Gergich,There's only two of us.
Chris Traeger,He has been in this department a long time.
Chris Traeger,I think maybe you could learn somethg from him.
Leslie Knope,"Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe inspiring, fun filled park ever conceived."
Chris Traeger,"Now how big is the park, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,it is .000003 square miles.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction The smallest park in Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr."
Leslie Knope,"Park in Terryville, but guess what?"
Leslie Knope,"Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther No, he does not suck old car tires."
Leslie Knope,He was one of the greatest men in history.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes I get competitive.
Chris Traeger,Has there been any resistance from the community?
Ben Wyatt,"No, not at all."
Ben Wyatt,It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.
Ben Wyatt,"It's inexpensive, it benefits the town, it's a total slam dunk."
Chris Traeger,"You two, when you work on a project together, are simply amazing."
Chris Traeger,Great job team.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, all these classes look amazing."
Andy Dwyer,I can't choose.
April Ludgate,"They do this thing called a ""shopping period,"" where you can just sample as many classes as you want."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Sports and Society.
Andy Dwyer,Physical Science.
Andy Dwyer,A crash course?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but it's not what you think."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"I did not graduate college, because I did not ""attend"" it, but I'm trying to improve myself, so I'm gonna start by taking just one class."
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna take a college course, Andrew, you should explore a new subject."
Ron Swanson,Broaden your horizons.
Andy Dwyer,Yup.
April Ludgate,Horizons are dumb.
April Ludgate,Never broaden your horizons.
Andy Dwyer,Yup.
April Ludgate,"Just take something you're great at and get an easy ""A""."
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but April's way sounds way easier."
Andy Dwyer,Guitar for beginners.
Ron Swanson,"I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college."
Ron Swanson,"Of all my coworkers, he is one of a small number whom I do not actively root against."
Ron Swanson,"Ugh, there I go getting all sappy."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,The first is the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Leslie Knope,Do you know who's bringing scissors?
Leslie Knope,Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
Leslie Knope,Number two
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, listen."
Ben Wyatt,I'm actually glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Ben Wyatt,"After this project finishes, I'm gonna focus on other departments and cut down my time with Parks and Rec."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We're just working out the kinks.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to decrease your time with me.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, you need to increase your time with me."
Leslie Knope,You need to spend more time with me.
Leslie Knope,That make sense?
Leslie Knope,I think it does.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Leslie, no, listen to me."
Ben Wyatt,"After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors."
Ben Wyatt,Those are my pens and pencils.
Jerry Gergich,"No, see, I think that Comic Sans always screams ""fun."""
Jerry Gergich,Right?
Jerry Gergich,"But, man, those ""r""s in Helvetica, they're just, you know, like, really popping for me."
Tom Haverford,I've never been more bored in my entire life.
Tom Haverford,Who cares about letters?
Tom Haverford,"The only good font is the Sopranos one, where the ""r"" is a pistol."
Tom Haverford,"Let's think bigger, people, come on."
Tom Haverford,What about a top to bottom makeover for the entire department?
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme."
Tom Haverford,"A whole, new, sexy vibe."
Jerry Gergich,I don't know.
Jerry Gergich,This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment."
Tom Haverford,"Cool, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a deadeyed government drone with no ambition.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich type guy."
Tom Haverford,I'm more of a Steve Harvey.
Tom Haverford,"I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits."
Extra,"Okay, can anyone tell me what this is called?"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, that's a fret."
Extra,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,And that little thing you got right there that's called a capo.
Andy Dwyer,Changes the key.
Extra,"Uh, maybe you should be in the advanced class?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, maybe I should."
April Ludgate,"Dude, dumb it down."
Andy Dwyer,"But I couldn't possibly, because I'm just a beginner."
Andy Dwyer,"I barely haven't even ever seen a ""gortar."
extra,Okay.
Extra,We will be working on basic chords for the first four weeks.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Four weeks.
Andy Dwyer,I'm already bored.
Ron Swanson,Of course you are.
Ron Swanson,You're not challenging yourself.
Ron Swanson,I suggest we sample a few more classes.
April Ludgate,Fine.
extra,Very good.
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Guess what.
Andy Dwyer,I was secretly an undercover rock star this whole time.
Ron Swanson,"For what it's worth, I think you would make an incredible brunette."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not even attending the ribboncutting ceremony of a park that we made together."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I'm just freaking out.
Leslie Knope,The only thing we have left is work.
Leslie Knope,And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?
Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?
Ann Perkins,I think you know what it means.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
Ann Perkins,That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, for God's sakes."
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, please, I beg of you."
Leslie Knope,Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan."
Ann Perkins,Leslie
Leslie Knope,Shh
Ann Perkins,Leslie
Leslie Knope,Ann Your quiet support means the world to me.
Leslie Knope,As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together."
Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting."
Leslie Knope,"The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail."
Leslie Knope,"So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead."
Extra,"Hi, I have a question about this project."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,Where's the fire?
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other first.
Leslie Knope,Tell me about your childhood.
Extra,Is there going to be basketball there?
extra,Basketball courts attract undesirables to my community.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court."
extra,"Because there's a definite type of person I associate with basketball, and I'd rather not have that type of person nearby."
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry.
Ben Wyatt,You don't need to worry.
extra,"Okay, I'll just come right out and say it."
extra,I'll tell you what type of person I don't like.
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to do that.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,I think we get it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point."
Leslie Knope,Intolerance.
Leslie Knope,Can we be doing more?
Leslie Knope,I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Extra,"Hello, everyone."
Extra,My name is Professor Barnes.
Extra,The class I'll be teaching this semester is introduction to lasers.
Extra,"The word ""laser"" stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the lasers?
Extra,This graphic here represents the electromagnetic spectrum arranged from low frequency
Andy Dwyer,He's not even using a laser pointer.
April Ludgate,He's right.
April Ludgate,This class stinks.
Ron Swanson,Stick with it.
Ron Swanson,You might learn something.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, excuse me."
Andy Dwyer,Professor?
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, there."
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,Curious.
Andy Dwyer,When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with?
Andy Dwyer,"And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them?"
Extra,We won't be using actual lasers in this course.
Extra,It's about the theory that makes them possible.
Andy Dwyer,One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.
Tom Haverford,"First up, a personal favorite, the Sopranos option."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna ""fugghedaboudit."""
Tom Haverford,This is our current community center.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,This is our new community center!
Tom Haverford,"That's right, it looks like an apple store."
Tom Haverford,"Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s."
Tom Haverford,I'm about to work a miracle.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,What a story.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,"Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something."
Mel,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Mel."
Leslie Knope,You're always up in arms about something.
Mel,"No, I'm not."
Mel,I'm not always up in arms about something.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that'll do it."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, everybody."
Leslie Knope,I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Leslie Knope,"Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes?"
April Ludgate,"Whoa, check it out."
April Ludgate,You can get credit for playing intramural frisbee golf.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you can take a class on the Civil War."
Andy Dwyer,Why would I take a class on something that's already happened?
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you guys have already had your say."
Andy Dwyer,Now I want to try something that I want to try.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random."
Linda Lonegan,"As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower."
Linda Lonegan,She did not beg for mercy.
Linda Lonegan,"she said, in a strong, clear voice, ""I am not afraid."""
Linda Lonegan,"""I was born to do this."""
April Ludgate,I want to be burned at the stake.
Linda Lonegan,Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.
Linda Lonegan,"To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
April Ludgate,That class was awesome.
Ron Swanson,I wholeheartedly agree.
Ron Swanson,"If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, then, it's decided."
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer will be taking ""women's lasers."""
April Ludgate,Women's studies.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"God, I cannot stop thinking about lasers."
Andy Dwyer,"""Women's studies."""
Andy Dwyer,"Is there such thing as ""women's lasers""?"
Andy Dwyer,That'd be my number one pick.
Extra,"Excuse me, what the heck is going on here?"
Leslie Knope,Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusive park.
Extra,We were told this would have very little impact on the neighborhood.
Extra,This flyer has hundreds of events.
Mel,There are fireworks every night at midnight?
Leslie Knope,They start at midnight.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when they're gonna end?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's all a mystery."
Extra,Don't you work for the government?
Leslie Knope,"I do, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes."
Leslie Knope,What can we do about it?
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you asked.
Leslie Knope,I have some ideas.
Tom Haverford,These are our current park rangers.
Tom Haverford,What are they up to?
Tom Haverford,No one cares.
Tom Haverford,"They're boring, and I hate them."
Tom Haverford,But coming this spring to the style network Ranger Reality Show.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, tom, but Chris, he just wanted us I mean, really, you've gone way off track."
Tom Haverford,"Well, guess what, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,I'm a dreamer.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,I dream big.
Tom Haverford,Deal with it.
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, weekends are for dreaming."
Jerry Gergich,You are a government worker.
Jerry Gergich,This is a government job.
Jerry Gergich,Plus isn't dreaming big exactly what got you in trouble with your old company?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where you going, Joe?"
Extra,Bathroom break.
Leslie Knope,"No, get back over there."
Leslie Knope,I'll find you a bottle or something.
Chris Traeger,Where did all these people come from?
Chris Traeger,And why did they turn so quickly on this project?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know how it goes."
Leslie Knope,It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
Leslie Knope,"I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,They are explicitly demanding it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events."
Ben Wyatt,"This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody."
Ben Wyatt,Everybody cool?
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Chris Traeger,Dream team.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team"
Chris Traeger,Dream team!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,But we're not.
Ben Wyatt,"You see, Leslie here is a team of one."
Ben Wyatt,"And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants."
Ben Wyatt,"Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels."
Ben Wyatt,So I don't think we should work together anymore.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,That was very hard to hear.
Chris Traeger,So many negative words.
Chris Traeger,I just need to process this.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, the dream team is dead."
Chris Traeger,But you guys had a great run.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and the park is open."
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Chris Traeger,Good job with that.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello ma'am, who is just as equal as man, I would like one ticket for, uh, women."
April Ludgate,He would like to register for Women's studies.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Here's the registration form.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Extra,And we'll need a check or money order for $940.
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you tell me it was so expensive?
April Ludgate,I didn't know.
April Ludgate,My parents pay for my classes.
April Ludgate,I'll just have them pay for yours too.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no!"
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Leslie Knope,Whose fault is this?
Leslie Knope,I demand to know.
Ann Perkins,Actually
Leslie Knope,Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,That's unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How dare he think that I'm a steamroller?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm just telling you this"
Leslie Knope,"I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again."
Ann Perkins,"No, what I was gonna say is that you really are"
Leslie Knope,Working too hard.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing"
Ann Perkins,You're a steamroller!
Ann Perkins,"You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal."
Ann Perkins,You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.
Ann Perkins,I don't even like Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,You love Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,You've seen all eight movies!
Ann Perkins,"When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me."
Leslie Knope,"Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's my headache!"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know I do this.
Leslie Knope,I'm the worst.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're very passionate."
Ann Perkins,You just push too hard sometimes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,It's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, is it?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone."
Leslie Knope,That's what he says he wants.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this steamroller is hanging up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine."
Leslie Knope,What do you what do you call that?
Ann Perkins,The roller?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Got you a little pickmeup, Tommy."
Jerry Gergich,A tripledecker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.
Jerry Gergich,Always makes me feel better.
Tom Haverford,Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.
Tom Haverford,Sounds terrific.
Tom Haverford,I guess I'm Jerry now.
Tom Haverford,"After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a homecooked meal with my three beautiful daughters."
Tom Haverford,What a miserable life.
Jerry Gergich,"I have been here, well, 30 some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day."
Jerry Gergich,"Heck, I still use my original I.D. card from my first day on the job."
Jerry Gergich,Check this out.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I got to go.
Tom Haverford,Put my sammie in the fridge.
April Ludgate,"Mouse Rat CD, 30 dollars."
April Ludgate,"Candy bars, 50 dollars."
April Ludgate,50 dollars.
April Ludgate,"God, people here are so cheap."
Ron Swanson,"April, where have you been?"
Ron Swanson,Over two phone calls came in unimpeded.
Andy Dwyer,"We're raising money for my college education, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I took a second job back at my old job.
Andy Dwyer,Do you want a shoe shine?
April Ludgate,It's 100 dollars.
April Ludgate,"Laugh all you want, Kyle."
April Ludgate,I already took the money out of your wallet.
Kyle,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Good news, son."
Ron Swanson,You have just won a Ron Swanson scholarship.
Andy Dwyer,I don't think so.
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember applying for
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
April Ludgate,Ron Swanson Scholarship.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you serious?"
Ron Swanson,Stop this.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Ron Swanson,"Stop, or you lose the money."
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,"I like the kid, and I have the money."
Ron Swanson,One thing I promised myself when I buried gold in my backyard was that I'd never be a hoarder or a miser about it.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business?"
Ann Perkins,You need to go talk to her.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,So she can force me to spend time with her again?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,I'm done talking.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know she can be strong willed and difficult, okay?"
Ann Perkins,She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.
Ann Perkins,But I really think she's ready to listen.
Ben Wyatt,You ate an entire cheesecake?
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you just throw it away?
Ann Perkins,"Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her."
Ann Perkins,"Also, P.S."
Ann Perkins,"it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does."
Ann Perkins,Will you please just talk to her?
Ann Perkins,For my sake?
Ann Perkins,"I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me."
Tom Haverford,"So we take the old logo from the 1970s, and we make limited edition hats, posters, tshirts, everything."
Tom Haverford,"People love limited editions, plus parents will get swept up in the nostalgia and want to go to the parks to recreate the fun they had growing up."
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,It is possibly the best idea anyone has had in this government in 100 years.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, terrific."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, but most of the credit goes to my number-four, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"He shared some words of wisdom with me today, and while he was yammering on about whatever, I happened to see his old ID card."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, buddy."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got very curious when you only left me one voicemail message, instead of your usual 20."
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Leslie Knope,"Here, have a seat."
Leslie Knope,But only if you want to.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I want to.
Leslie Knope,"I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us."
Leslie Knope,"I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing."
Leslie Knope,"I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."
Ben Wyatt,I I don't want that.
Ben Wyatt,Really.
Ben Wyatt,But I just think it's for the best.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,There is another option.
Leslie Knope,"We could just say ""screw it"" and do this thing for real."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,I miss you like crazy.
Leslie Knope,I think about you all the time.
Leslie Knope,I want to be with you.
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say ""screw it."""
Ben Wyatt,"No, we would have to tell Chris."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,It could turn into a scandal.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,It could hurt your campaign.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, how would you imagine we do this?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"But I know how I feel, and I want to be with you."
Leslie Knope,But I'm done steamrolling people.
Leslie Knope,This is how I feel.
Leslie Knope,How do you feel?
Ron Swanson,First day.
Ron Swanson,You ready?
Andy Dwyer,As ready as I'll ever be.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap, I forgot my books."
Andy Dwyer,And my computer.
Ron Swanson,Just pay attention to the lecture and enjoy.
Ron Swanson,"My first day of college, my father dropped me off at the steel mill."
Ron Swanson,He didn't think I should go to college.
Ron Swanson,"But I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot."
Ron Swanson,I hope Andy does too.
Andy Dwyer,"We need to start teaching women football, teaching women U.F.C. , teaching them to drive trucks without crashing."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, maybe I'm only sexy."
Andy Dwyer,"Then-- maybe that's all you see, but at least you can give me extra money."
Andy Dwyer,Tip money and stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"I'll flirt with you, write my name on a napkin."
Andy Dwyer,"They're gonna do it in a right, kind of legal way that empowers prostitution."
Andy Dwyer,We don't rest until we get that.
Andy Dwyer,That will be progress.
Linda Lonegan,That is extremely incorrect.
Andy Dwyer,"I thought I thought maybe it was when I was I, uh I'll get 'em next time."
Andy Dwyer,"Back to you, Professor."
