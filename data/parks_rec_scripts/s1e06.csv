Character,Line
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,"We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off."
Leslie Knope,"It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Your boobs are dead.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Tom Haverford,"Wow, it's like a sweaty pinata."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, my iPod!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah!"
Andy Dwyer,My pirate!
Leslie Knope,"Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?"
Dr. Harris,"It's a highly disgusting request, but I don't see why not."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project."
Leslie Knope,We will build this park!
Andy Dwyer,"It is gonna feel so good to walk again, finally."
Dr. Harris,Easy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no!"
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, they might be a little weak at first."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, guys."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back into the world of walking, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I just wanted to say--
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,Ann wants to say something.
Ann Perkins,I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive.
Ann Perkins,"When Andy fell in the pit, I didn't expect anyone in government to reach out to us."
Ann Perkins,"So, thanks."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're welcome, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, when are you gonna tell them about my show?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Ann Perkins,Andy's band is playing a show.
Ann Perkins,And we want you all to come.
Andy Dwyer,"It's gonna be a party, so check your suits at the door."
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna get crazy.
Ann Perkins,"Andy's band is really good, and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play."
Ann Perkins,He's been writing all these songs about things that are physically near him.
Andy Dwyer,Sandwich!
Andy Dwyer,Are you turkey or ham?
Ann Perkins,Ham.
Andy Dwyer,Lamp!
Andy Dwyer,Wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched
Mark Brendanawicz,What kind of music does your band play?
Andy Dwyer,"You know, I don't really like to define it, but it's like Matchbox Twenty meets The Fray."
Tom Haverford,"So, rock."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, again, I don't really like to define it."
April Ludgate,I totally get what you mean.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would love to come to this thing."
Leslie Knope,When is it?
Ann Perkins,Tonight at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I can't go.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Leslie Knope,My mom set up this meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's like a political tete-a-tete with a local bigwig.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, you're not gonna go?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you guys."
Leslie Knope,You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.
Leslie Knope,"This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park."
Leslie Knope,But I wanna go to the concert!
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Ann Perkins,Play hooky!
Ann Perkins,Blow off the meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,"But I'll meet up with you guys after the tete-a-tete, I promise."
Nate,"Hey, Mark, congratulations."
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thanks, Nate."
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Nate,You got that speed bump thing taken care of.
Nate,Finally.
Nate,Nice work.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yay.
Mark Brendanawicz,There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,"Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by."
Ann Perkins,I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.
Ann Perkins,He wrote this new song about what happened to him called The Pit.
Ann Perkins,"It's one of those rare songs that rocks really hard, and also informs people about a small public works project."
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy's doing well?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected."
Dr. Harris,"Well, not really."
Dr. Harris,"If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, two weeks ago?"
Dr. Harris,That's when they were scheduled to come off.
Ann Perkins,But he told me that you told him he should wait.
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,He rescheduled.
Dr. Harris,"Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained."
Ann Perkins,I have waited on him hand and foot for two months.
Dr. Harris,"Well, I guess that explains it."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,All right!
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh In just a minute, Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out."
Andy Dwyer,Please be patient while we rock out the equipment setup.
Andy Dwyer,The band has had a few different names over the years.
Andy Dwyer,"We started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,Uh.
Andy Dwyer,"Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes with Orange, then Everything Rhymes with Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Hand Rail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Three Skin Jet Black Pope, we went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat."
Andy Dwyer,"God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud, I kind of hate it."
Leslie Knope,"Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council."
George Gernway,What kind of movies do you like?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Uh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers."
George Gernway,I like all kinds of movies.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it."
Leslie Knope,How difficult is rezoning in your town?
Leslie Knope,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?
George Gernway,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Great.
George Gernway,It's refreshing to be with someone who actually likes talking about government issues.
George Gernway,Most of the women I go out with find it boring.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos."
George Gernway,Your mother mentioned that you don't date much.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I've been focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
George Gernway,I haven't been dating much either since my divorce.
George Gernway,It hasn't been easy.
George Gernway,"And I'm coping, but it was tough on the kids."
George Gernway,"Not my kids, 'cause they're grownup, but it was tough on their kids."
George Gernway,Shouldn't bring up my divorce on a first date.
George Gernway,But I feel I can tell you anything.
Leslie Knope,Uh
George Gernway,I think it's going quite well.
George Gernway,And she looks like a young Sandy Duncan.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He thinks we're on a date.
Leslie Knope,Did you tell him we were on a date?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You're not getting any younger.
Leslie Knope,"Well, neither is he."
Leslie Knope,And he's 62 years old.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Just go back in there and finish the dinner.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, how are you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Parks Department."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,"This is Beth, my exwife Tammy's better looking sister."
Beth,Nice to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Nice to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You guys are together?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy cheated on me.
Ron Swanson,Then we divorced.
Ron Swanson,"Then last week, I ran into her sister Beth here."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out she hates Tammy, too, so we've started dating."
Ron Swanson,It's like a fairy tale.
Beth,"Yeah, Tammy stinks."
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I want you to meet my wife.
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,I'm Wendy Haverford.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're Tom's wife.
Wendy,Don't hold it against me.
Tom Haverford,Look at how hot she is.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that crazy?
Tom Haverford,And she's a surgeon.
Tom Haverford,She makes a ton of money!
Tom Haverford,Bam!
April Ludgate,This is Derek.
Mark Brendanawicz,Cool.
Mark Brendanawicz,How long have you guys been dating?
April Ludgate,We're just friends.
April Ludgate,He's like the gayest person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,But I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say so."
April Ludgate,I don't wanna talk to you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, tonight, I'm the Parks Department's seventh wheel."
George Gernway,This is my oldest son.
George Gernway,He's a very no nonsense person like yourself.
George Gernway,And this is my youngest.
George Gernway,He's about your age.
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,"So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?"
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,"Come on, enough business."
George Gernway,Let's have some fun!
George Gernway,Try some of my chicken.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
George Gernway,Just a taste.
George Gernway,Have a little taste of chicken!
George Gernway,Just a bit!
George Gernway,Just a taste!
George Gernway,"Chicken, chicken, chicken!"
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
George Gernway,"Delicious, right?"
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
George Gernway,I really like this restaurant.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a great place for a business meeting.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,We need to talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, hey."
Andy Dwyer,We're just about to start.
Andy Dwyer,Could you grab me a triple whiskey water?
Ann Perkins,"You would like that, wouldn't you?"
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Ann Perkins,You have two perfectly good legs.
Ann Perkins,Get it yourself.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, guys!"
Andy Dwyer,Thanks for coming out.
Andy Dwyer,We're Scarecrow Boat.
Andy Dwyer,This first song is called Menace Ball.
Andy Dwyer,"Two, three, four I know you been changing But I been changing, too You say that you've moved on"
George Gernway,Thank you.
George Gernway,What kind of movies do you like?
Leslie Knope,You already asked me that.
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,Sorry.
George Gernway,Senior moment.
George Gernway,"Hey, am I keeping you from something?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go."
George Gernway,"Well, if you want to go to the rock show, I don't mind."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
George Gernway,Sure!
George Gernway,I haven't been to a rock show in a long time.
George Gernway,The last rock show I went to was the Everly Brothers.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
George Gernway,You like the Everly Brothers?
Leslie Knope,They're my favorite rock group.
George Gernway,They're so good.
George Gernway,I am getting very positive signals.
Andy Dwyer,You and me together You and me forever You and me together forever Together forever
Andy Dwyer,"All right, take five, guys."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go acoustic.
Andy Dwyer,"This next song is dedicated to her, my girlfriend, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,I call it Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Ann
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, the band's really good."
Mark Brendanawicz,I liked that song Grapple Hound.
Ann Perkins,Gossip Town?
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,"My only criticism, I hate the name of the band."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they should change their name to Big, Lying Baby."
Ann Perkins,Or Where's My Sandwich?
Ann Perkins,Or Don't Forget To Bring Home Beers After Work.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Since you brought it up, I'm just gonna say it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't get you andâ¦ I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I mean, I like Andy a lot."
Mark Brendanawicz,But there's tons of guys out there who have jobs and who respect you and think you're attractive.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,You mean guys like you
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Ann Perkins,for instance?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no, no, no, not me."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Good, 'cause, for a second there, I thought you were hitting on me in front of my boyfriend."
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Not my style.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Even though you did just call him a big, lying baby."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I do find you attractive.
Ann Perkins,"So, you are hitting on me."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not.
Mark Brendanawicz,I promise you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"But if I were, would you be interested?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Let me tell you why, because I'm in a crappy mood, and I don't really appreciate what's happening right here."
Ann Perkins,"Number one, you've never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than a week."
Ann Perkins,"Number two, the girls"
Mark Brendanawicz,That's fine.
Ann Perkins,Just you do choose to spend the week with
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad we avoided that."
Andy Dwyer,Pit!
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit Pit!"
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in that pit"
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you very much, everybody!"
Andy Dwyer,We are Scarecrow Boat!
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,Screw it!
Andy Dwyer,We are Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you very much!
Andy Dwyer,Good night!
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I missed it?
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Who's your friend?
George Gernway,I'm George.
George Gernway,I'm Leslie's date.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,He's my date.
Leslie Knope,George Gernway.
Leslie Knope,He's the City Manager in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, George Gernway."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"This is my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,She's my age.
Wendy,Hi.
George Gernway,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea why Ann is upset with me.
Andy Dwyer,But I do know she's too nice to yell at me in front of all these people.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I am not leaving this bar."
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard you went to Indiana State."
George Gernway,Yes.
Tom Haverford,My buddy Todd went there.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you know him.
Tom Haverford,What year did you graduate?
George Gernway,1968
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"Todd graduated in 2005, so you probably missed him."
Tom Haverford,How was your date with Leslie?
Andy Dwyer,"We change the band name, and then we send the demo out."
Andy Dwyer,We're completely ready---
Ann Perkins,"Andy, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm just debriefing with the band."
Andy Dwyer,It's just gonna be just one second.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Leslie Knope!
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,You have to meet my band.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, band!"
Burly,Hey.
Burly,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.
Leslie Knope,Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?
Andy Dwyer,An encore.
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, let's get our stuff out of the boxes."
Ann Perkins,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, forget it."
Ann Perkins,"No, we're going home."
Leslie Knope,"No, don't leave."
Leslie Knope,I just got here.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, she's here with her dad."
Andy Dwyer,It'd be kind of rude to not do at least one more song.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,We're gonna go.
Ann Perkins,I'll call you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"This weekend, guys."
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Leslie Knope,George.
Leslie Knope,George!
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,"Look at me, out like a light."
George Gernway,I think I should head home now.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to meet you.
George Gernway,It was fun.
George Gernway,I had a nice time.
George Gernway,Don't think I'll go out with her again.
George Gernway,There was just no spark.
Wendy,How did Leslie meet her boyfriend?
Tom Haverford,She used to read him books at the senior center.
Beth,Wow.
Beth,How old is he?
Tom Haverford,"He's six, but he has Benjamin Button Disease."
Beth,Whoa.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?"
Tom Haverford,I do!
Wendy,I do!
Mark Brendanawicz,Deputy Director Knope.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where do you think you're going?
Leslie Knope,Home.
Leslie Knope,It's been a really crappy night.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have a beer with me.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80 year old man.
Leslie Knope,I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy was too young for you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You should be dating guys in their early hundreds.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm telling you, you should be dating men that Al Roker announces their birthdays."
Leslie Knope,Hey! Congratulations are in order.
Leslie Knope,I heard that you got that speed bump thing through.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't make fun of me.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,I made a bump into a smaller bump.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a great day for America.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about? That thing was a pain in the butt.
Leslie Knope,You fixed a problem.
Leslie Knope,That's what we're supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I are really connecting tonight.
Leslie Knope,Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago.
Leslie Knope,There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights.
Leslie Knope,That time we were also at a bar.
Leslie Knope,And he was also pretty drunk.
Leslie Knope,"If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay--
Leslie Knope,Don't over-think it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Keep it simple, nice shady trees, lots of grass, benches."
Leslie Knope,A picnic table?
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,Water feature.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, huge rocks to be climbing on."
Mark Brendanawicz,A play area for the kids.
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,I would live in that park.
Mark Brendanawicz,But then you'd be homeless.
Bartender,"Hey, we're closing up."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,What time is it? I should go.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! We're getting drinks to go."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,Beers to go!
Leslie Knope,Where are we going? All the bars are closed.
Mark Brendanawicz,You think I can get my beer bottle in that shopping cart right there?
Leslie Knope,"What? Mark, don't."
Leslie Knope,This pit isn't a dump.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look around, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I mean, there's crap everywhere."
Mark Brendanawicz,One beer bottle is not gonna make any difference.
Mark Brendanawicz,Damn it! I was so close there!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so"
Mark Brendanawicz,It was pretty close!
Leslie Knope,So far to the left! So far to the left!
Mark Brendanawicz,You think you can do any better?
Leslie Knope,"No, please."
Leslie Knope,I don't want anyone to see! I'm the Deputy Director of Parks
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're the Deputy Director of Parks and blah blah-- You know, nobody's gonna see it."
Mark Brendanawicz,Go on and chuck it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Unbelievable! That's unbelievable! You missed the entire pit, which is huge, by the way."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't do anything wrong.
Ann Perkins,You didn't do anything wrong?
Andy Dwyer,Mmm-mmm.
Ann Perkins,I waited on you hand and foot.
Ann Perkins,"And it was exhausting! I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago!"
Andy Dwyer,That is not true.
Ann Perkins,It's not true? So you're calling Dr. Harris a liar?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.
Ann Perkins,How about that?
Andy Dwyer,You call him! You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I will.
Andy Dwyer,Don't call him right now!
Ann Perkins,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Because it's late.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, just put the phone down."
Andy Dwyer,Fine! You want the truth?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Could I have gotten my casts off two weeks ago? Technically, yes."
Andy Dwyer,"But I really, really like it when you serve me food."
Ann Perkins,Get out.
Ann Perkins,Get out of my house.
Andy Dwyer,But what--
Ann Perkins,"Take a walk with your overly-healed legs, and let me think about this relationship."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this pit."
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope,Are we ever gonna turn it into a park?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, this is already a park! Look, I mean, you got Dirt Slide over here, you got Ring Around The Diaper you could play there."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You've got Duck, Duck, Glass you could play right there."
Mark Brendanawicz,Mystery Trash.
Mark Brendanawicz,"What's not to love about this park, right here, now?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"I wish we could turn it into a pit, frankly, don't you?"
Leslie Knope,"But, seriously, I mean, really?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Honestly, Leslie, it's gonna be a long, uphill battle."
Mark Brendanawicz,You are gonna be super annoyed with all the people that want you to fail.
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is a sea of red tape, endless roadblocks."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, yeah, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Screw it.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna try to do it anyway.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Kennedy put a man on the moon."
Mark Brendanawicz,He did.
Leslie Knope,I can build one park.
Mark Brendanawicz,I really admire your tenacity.
Leslie Knope,I really admire you.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't the way I want this to happen again.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope,"I think you should go home, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sorry.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna get out of here.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, it's"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Mark, are you all right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Are you okay? Oh, my God!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope,Help!
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope,Help!
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope,Help!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe! Baby, open up! That guy Mark just fell in the pit!"
Ann Perkins,What?
Andy Dwyer,You know that guy Mark?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He just fell in the pit!
Andy Dwyer,You gotta go check it out.
Andy Dwyer,You're a nurse.
Andy Dwyer,I think he'd probably be hurt.
Andy Dwyer,"Seriously, it's pretty bad! Pit! I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit The pit! I fell in it, the pit"
