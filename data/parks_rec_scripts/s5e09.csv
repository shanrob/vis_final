Ann Perkins,"You guys, that's so mean."
April Ludgate,It's not mean if he doesn't know about it.
April Ludgate,It's like talking about people behind their backs.
April Ludgate,Everybody wins.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,You should at least invite Jerry to the dinner.
Tom Haverford,Ha!
Tom Haverford,That's hilarious.
Tom Haverford,You should do standup.
Ann Perkins,"If you're kidding, you suck, but if you're serious, I actually have been thinking about it."

Ron Swanson,"Leslie, may I present Diane Lewis?"
Diane Lewis,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Diane, this is Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, wow."
Leslie Knope,"Ron has told me so much about you, in that he has told me your name is Diane, and you exist."
Diane Lewis,"Oh, yeah."
Diane Lewis,He's not a big sharer.
Diane Lewis,I don't even know what his middle name is.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's Ulysses."
Diane Lewis,I can see why he didn't tell me that.
Ron Swanson,"Mary, mother of God."
Ron Swanson,That's Christian Becksvoort!
Ron Swanson,He's the modern master of the Shaker style.
Ron Swanson,I never dreamed that I would see him in the flesh.
Diane Lewis,Go over and say hello.
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm sure he gets swamped with attention all the time."
Ron Swanson,"Ooh, if you ladies will excuse me, there is a jack plane that needs my attention."
Diane Lewis,Go on then.
Leslie Knope,"So tell me everything about yourself: Your kids, your hobbies."
Leslie Knope,"What are your five biggest hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets?"
Tom Haverford,"In honor of Jerry Dinner, let's each say our favorite Jerry moment from the past year."
April Ludgate,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Mine was The time he slipped on a cinnabon and landed in a bunch of garbage.
April Ludgate,My favorite Jerry moment was when he ate a bowl of glue.
Andy Dwyer,My favorite Jerry moment is when you switched out his potato soup with glue and he didn't know.
Andy Dwyer,"You're so cute when you're bullying, babe."
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,Ann was right.
Donna Meagle,This is mean.
Donna Meagle,We are going to pick up Jerry.
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,No!
Donna Meagle,It's Christmas time.
Donna Meagle,Don't you want to be good people?
Tom Haverford,Not really.
April Ludgate,Never.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, if we're going that way, can we stop at our place real quick?"
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I forgot to put on deodorant.
Andy Dwyer,And a jacket and one of my socks.
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I gotta poop, but I could stop anywhere for that."
Leslie Knope,"I know you didn't, but if you had gone to Hogwarts Academy, which House do you think you would have been?"
Diane Lewis,"Look, obviously, I want to say Gryffindor But I've got to go with Hufflepuff."
Leslie Knope,I respect your honesty.
Leslie Knope,Gryffindor.
Leslie Knope,Seeker on the Quidditch team.
Ron Swanson,"Diane, that's my chair, right there."
Diane Lewis,"It's beautiful, Ron."
Diane Lewis,Yours is the winner.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I stand a chance.
Diane Lewis,"Hey, you most certainly do."
Diane Lewis,They'd be crazy not to vote for you.
Leslie Knope,Which one is Ron's?
Diane Lewis,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Smart, funny, independent, and sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Diane Lewis?
Leslie Knope,More like Diane Sawyer.
Donna Meagle,Whoa!
Donna Meagle,What is going on at the Gergiches?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry's having a Christmas party!
Tom Haverford,I can't believe he didn't invite us.
Tom Haverford,How dare he!
Tom Haverford,What'd we ever do to him?
Andy Dwyer,It's probably just family.
April Ludgate,And Ben and Chris.
Andy Dwyer,And Ann.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even know she knew Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,The Gergiches really go all out.
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,This is literally the best nonfat eggnog I've ever had.
Ben Wyatt,"Remain calm, but I think you just drank some of the regular, full fat eggnog."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, one cup won't kill you."
Chris Traeger,"No, but it will add exactly 440 calories."
Chris Traeger,But you know what?
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger,You only live once.
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,"I don't know if you know this, but things with fat in them taste way better than things with no fat."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris everybody knows that."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, guess why my thumbs are up."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Because I'm giving you my 100% approval about Diane.
Leslie Knope,She is perfect for you.
Leslie Knope,She gets you.
Leslie Knope,"She is at the bar right now ordering a Lagavulin, neat for you."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, she's even putting up with all this stupid, boring woodworking stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but, you know, it's not the Super Bowl, guys."
Leslie Knope,Let's take it down a notch.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, you have my approval."
Ron Swanson,I don't need your approval.
Leslie Knope,But you have it.
Ron Swanson,Don't need it.
Leslie Knope,But you got it.
Leslie Knope,This could end up being the best night in Ron Swanson's life.
Leslie Knope,"I am so, so happy for him"
Tammy 2,"Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen."
Tammy 2,"Wow, look at this room."
Tammy 2,"So much wood, ready to be worked."
Leslie Knope,[Bleep] me!
Leslie Knope,"Alert alert, alert, alert."
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Tammy 2,"Gosh, I never dreamed you'd be here."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, this is Diane."
Ron Swanson,"Diane, this is a piece of human garbage named Tammy, who is also my exwife."
Tammy 2,Twice exwife.
Tammy 2,We were married twice.
Leslie Knope,And divorced twice.
Leslie Knope,Everything is done.
Leslie Knope,They are totally done.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, what are you doing here?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, I just have a little something I need to get drilled."
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you for a moment?
Leslie Knope,"Everything's fine, we're just gonna chat."
Leslie Knope,"Shouldn't you be at the library, forcing people to borrow books?"
Tammy 2,"Leslie, you and I both know that the library closes at 3:00 p.m."
Leslie Knope,Of course it does.
Tammy 2,"Besides, I like to keep tabs on Ron."
Leslie Knope,So you can ruin his life?
Tammy 2,"So I can have fun with him, and sometimes ruining his life can be a part of that, sure."
Leslie Knope,"This may be the hardest challenge yet for Leslie Knope, emotional guardian."
Leslie Knope,"I need to protect a sweet couple from a sex crazed demon librarian who makes me question my stance on using the ""B"" word."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, maybe just this once."
Leslie Knope,"No, Leslie, fight it."
Leslie Knope,Fight it.
April Ludgate,It looks warm in there!
April Ludgate,Warm and happy.
Donna Meagle,"Mm, look at that gingerbread man."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I don't see any gingerbread cookies.
Donna Meagle,"I'm talking about that jackedup, light skinned dude."
Donna Meagle,Look like Blake Griffin.
Andy Dwyer,You guys!
Andy Dwyer,There's a buffet in the house!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even know you could do that!
Tom Haverford,We need to crash this party.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, let us in."
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."
Ann Perkins,You want to come into Jerry's party?
Ann Perkins,And why is that?
April Ludgate,"I need a place to deliver this baby, Ann."
April Ludgate,It's coming out of me right now.
April Ludgate,I'm pregnant.
Ann Perkins,This is a lovely party thrown by a lovely man and his lovely family.
Ann Perkins,There's no place for meanies.
April Ludgate,"Aw, forget it, I'm coming in."
April Ludgate,Ow!
April Ludgate,Get off me.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"You're so weak, really?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I'm barely even doing anything."
Ann Perkins,Are you iron deficient?
Ann Perkins,Let me look at your palm.
April Ludgate,Ow.
April Ludgate,"It's because of your man strength, Man Perkins."
Tom Haverford,"Let us in, Ann."
Tom Haverford,"It's cold outside, and I can't wear mittens 'cause they're unflattering to my hands."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, guys."
Ann Perkins,This is your penance.
Ann Perkins,You can come in if you do something nice for Jerry.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I already did something nice for Jerry."
Donna Meagle,I drove here to take him to Jerry Dinner.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna."
Ann Perkins,You can come in.

Tammy 2,"Oh, my gosh."
Tammy 2,What a coinkydinky.
Tammy 2,"Look, we're sitting at the same table!"
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, this table is reserved."
Tammy 2,A guy traded me his seat for a peek and a squeeze.

Tom Haverford,He's the one that didn't invite us to his Christmas party.
Tom Haverford,Jerry Filter!
April Ludgate,Jerry Filter!
Andy Dwyer,Who's Jerry Filter?
Tom Haverford,"Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends a lot of annoying emails."
Tom Haverford,"So a while ago, I put a filter on all our accounts."
Tom Haverford,Everything from Jerry goes directly to spam.
Tom Haverford,and Here's our invitation.
April Ludgate,There's three years of nice messages on here.
April Ludgate,"""Congratulations on your wedding."""
April Ludgate,I'm rooting for you kids.
April Ludgate,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"""Hope you have the best birthday, Tom."""
Andy Dwyer,I just tied my high score in Snake.

Extra,"The nominees are: Asa Christiana for chair, Ron Swanson for chair, H.W. Davenport for chair."
Tammy 2,"So exciting, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, this is your moment."
Leslie Knope,Tune her out.
Leslie Knope,She's not even here.
Extra,And the winner is Ron Swanson for chair.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Ron Swanson,This award is the only one I'd ever give a damn about.
Ron Swanson,"I made my first chair when I was five, but the quality of the wood was wanting, so when I turned nine, I used my factory wages to purchase some beautiful local walnut."
Ron Swanson,"Uh, thank you for this Uh, this all good night good."
Ron Swanson,Uh There it is.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're looking at a picture of Millie."
Ben Wyatt,"You want to take off, grab some vegan fries?"
Chris Traeger,She really was delightful.
Chris Traeger,I truly wish her all the best.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, maybe going to therapy 1000 times a week is helping. I mean, if you'd seen that picture a month ago, you would have fallen apart."
Chris Traeger,It's just a picture.
Gayle Gergich,Millie!
Millicent Gergich,"Hi, mom!"
Millicent Gergich,We wanted to surprise you and come home early.
Millicent Gergich,"Oh, hey, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Extra,"Let's take a moment now to remember those woodworkers who are no longer with us, and the beautiful coffins they all designed themselves."
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Have you seen Ron?
Diane Lewis,He disappeared after the speech and I can't find him anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Diane ugh.
Leslie Knope,The stuff with Tammy is so complex and weird and gross.
Leslie Knope,It just would probably be better if you let me handle it.
Diane Lewis,I'm not worried about Tammy.
Diane Lewis,"I mean, I'm a middle school vice principal."
Diane Lewis,I deal with hormonal psychopaths all the time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Diane Lewis,What concerns me is you.
Leslie Knope,You who?
Diane Lewis,You you.
Leslie Knope,You me?
Diane Lewis,You're the one who's been at his side all night.
Diane Lewis,"You're the one who's been protecting him, you're the one who knows all the intimate details of his romantic history with that monster."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you misunderstand."
Leslie Knope,I'm happily engaged.
Diane Lewis,"You and Ron have an intimacy that I just don't understand, so if there is a threat to my relationship with Ron, it's not Tammy."
Diane Lewis,It's you.
Extra,"Okay, folks, fasten your seatbelts."
Extra,It's the big one: Best Desk.
Ron Swanson,Where's Diane?
Ron Swanson,I need her.
Leslie Knope,She left.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,Tammy ruins everything.
Leslie Knope,"No, she left because of me."
Leslie Knope,She's threatened by our relationship.
Ron Swanson,That's ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,I don't think of you romantically.
Ron Swanson,"You're pro government, you never stop talking, and you have blonde hair."
Ron Swanson,You're my worst nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, one man's ""worst nightmare"" is every other man's ""total package."""
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, I don't think it's about dating."
Leslie Knope,I kind of see where Diane is coming from.
Leslie Knope,"We are close friends, and I'm very involved in your life."
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't say we're close.
Leslie Knope,"By Swanson standards, we're close."
Leslie Knope,I know when your birthday is.
Ron Swanson,So does BaskinRobbins.
Leslie Knope,I know that you secretly love artichokes and plums.
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman! Fine, we're friends."
Ron Swanson,So what do I do? Tammy's waiting for me in my car.
Leslie Knope,"I think you should take my car and go get Diane, and I will handle Tammy."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Protect your eyes, she's a gouger."
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Millicent Gergich,"Chris, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Carl."
Chris Traeger,Well.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, there."
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,How did you two meet?
Extra,Whitewater rafting.
Millicent Gergich,"He was the young rafting instructor all the girls were into, and I was the young rafting instructor all the guys were into And then we got together."
Chris Traeger,"Ah, so random, right? What a story! I felt like my heart was whitewater rafting."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I won't keep you guys."
Chris Traeger,It's good to see you.
Chris Traeger,Mwah.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, little tip, there is fat in the eggnog."
Millicent Gergich,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,So how'd it go? You okay?
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger,"If therapy has taught me anything, it's that I need to face my fears, even when my fears are engaged to a man with the chiseled jawline of a young me."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,Thank me?
Ben Wyatt,For what?
Chris Traeger,For looking out for me tonight.
Chris Traeger,You're a good friend.
Ben Wyatt,Hey So Gayle and Jerry I've thought about it a lot.
Chris Traeger,There's no logical explanation.
Tammy 2,"Well, hello there, Big"
Tammy 2,Gross! Leslie? Where's Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Too late, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Ron's gone.
Leslie Knope,You'll never get him back.
Tammy 2,Wanna bet? That relationship is weak.
Tammy 2,"All I have to do is find Ron within the next few hours, and he's toast."
Leslie Knope,"Few hours, you say?"
Tammy 2,Leslie! Stop this car! Where are we going?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Tammy 2,You're gonna regret this!
Ann Perkins,"Well, hello again."
Ann Perkins,"You ready to be nice to Jerry? Because it's so cold out here, it reminds me of my wife's lasagna."
April Ludgate,I actually like that one.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys! I thought you weren't coming."
Jerry Gergich,"I you know, never got your RSVP."
April Ludgate,"Hi, Jerry."
April Ludgate,We got you a gift.
April Ludgate,Merry Christmas.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, just we took up a collection to pay your hospital bills, since you almost farted yourself to death."
Tom Haverford,"Every time we did something mean, we put a dollar in a box."
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I'm the luckiest man on earth.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, come on in! It's a party."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh Oh, Geez."
Tammy 2,Give me the keys!
Leslie Knope,No!
Tammy 2,Give 'em to me!
Leslie Knope,"Never! Hey, game over, Tammy."
Tammy 2,What?
Tammy 2,You!
Tammy 2,Ah! I'm going in!
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God, I am so turned on right now."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah, tell me you're not feeling this."
Leslie Knope,You are so crazy!
Tammy 2,I got 'em! I got 'em.
Leslie Knope,No! No!
Tammy 2,Ah! You'll never catch me!
Leslie Knope,Come back here Ow! You are not gonna ruin this night!
Tammy 2,Get away from this car!
Tammy 2,No! What are you doing? You're crazy!
Tammy 2,Ron! Ron!
Leslie Knope,"Ha! You're too late! No! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Diane Lewis,"She just knows you so well, and I was starting to wonder if I was ever gonna get to that point."
Diane Lewis,I'm worried that maybe there isn't room in your life for another woman.
Ron Swanson,"At this very moment, Leslie is throwing herself in front of a freight train named Tammy for me and you."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie is a wonderful, loyal friend, who is very important in my life, but I would sooner visit Europe than have something romantic happen between us."
Ron Swanson,"Although, if you'd like to visit Europe, I like you so much, I'd be willing to risk it."
Diane Lewis,"But not France, right?"
Ron Swanson,"God, no."
Ron Swanson,"See? You know me pretty well already, but you're about to get to know me even better."
Ron Swanson,"I brought you here because I want to show you something that almost no one knows about certainly not Tammy, and not even Leslie Knope."
Extra,"Ladies and gentleman, and especially the ladies, put your hands together for the one, the only, my man, Mr. Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,A mighty fine holiday evening to you all.
Extra,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"It might be cold outside, but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz."
Ron Swanson,"I, of course, am Duke Silver, and I would like to dedicate this first song To my duchess."
Extra,You're so lucky.
Extra,I'm going to kill you.
Leslie Knope,I think it's time to officially retire as Ron's emotional guardian.
Leslie Knope,"That's Diane's job now, and she seems more than up to the task."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'd do anything for Ron even spend a whole night fighting his crazy ex-wife."
Leslie Knope,But I think I'm safe.
Leslie Knope,She's gotta be tired by now.
Tammy 2,Hi.
Ron Swanson,Officer Skorggel.
Extra,I pulled over a Tammy Swanson for driving erratically.
Extra,"Ran the plates, saw it was your car."
Extra,Figured it was stolen.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron, why don't you get me out of these handcuffs, so I can put you into these handcuffs."
Diane Lewis,"Yes, please officer, get her out of those cuffs."
Diane Lewis,I want this to be a fair fight.
Ron Swanson,"Officer, did you see any sign of a passenger?"
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,There we go.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Help.
