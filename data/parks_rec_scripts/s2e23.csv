Leslie Knope,"Okay, open this one. Here, I'll help you."
April Ludgate,Whoa! Documents.
Leslie Knope,"Yes. This is your original intern application, your original parking pass. This is your original photo ID."
April Ludgate,Did you get that out of my purse?
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,And this is a copy of your very first paycheck.
Tom Haverford,Who's that from?
Leslie Knope,Me. It's from me.
Leslie Knope,Happy birthday.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Open mine.
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's nice. I mean it can be a little sentimental to kind of frame things, but its always nice to remember the beginning of something, you know, the start. And when you--"
April Ludgate,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for God's sake."
Ron Swanson,She's an adult now.
Ron Swanson,She should know how to responsibly handle and discharge a weapon.
Ron Swanson,"That there is a Sig Sauer .22 caliber Mosquito, manufactured in Switzerland for their pussy police force."
Ron Swanson,"This two toned, lightweight model is perfect for a skinny, little thing like you."
April Ludgate,"Gee, thanks Ron."
Ron Swanson,"I will hold onto this for you until we get you licensed up, and then I'll take you for some target practice."
April Ludgate,Goody.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I do feel a little guilty."
Ron Swanson,I'm re-gifting.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's great."
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to hear all about your family vacation.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,"Get out, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, birthday girl."
Andy Dwyer,Got you a birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Did you like that?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That high five was your birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Just kidding.
Andy Dwyer,That wasn't it.
Andy Dwyer,I got you something else.
Andy Dwyer,I wrote you a song.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,What's it called?
Andy Dwyer,Not telling.
Andy Dwyer,But I'll give you a clue.
Andy Dwyer,It's named after a month out of the year.
April Ludgate,So April?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,That would have been way better.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,I can rewrite the lyrics.
April Ludgate,Are you coming to my party?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world."
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Okay, cool."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, we'll hang out then."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,It's going to be fun.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I am 21 years old today."
April Ludgate,Which is the age that pretty much everyone agrees makes you an adult.
Leslie Knope,"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."
Leslie Knope,"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48."
Ann Perkins,That's good!
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?
Leslie Knope,"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little."
Leslie Knope,"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot."
Ann Perkins,You wrote that?
Leslie Knope,"Jack London, again."
Leslie Knope,Is there too many Jack London quotes?
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, you can never have enough."
Ann Perkins,That is easily the most exciting budget proposal I have ever heard.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm presenting it today."
Leslie Knope,"And if it flies, we are going to get our money to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Would've taken 13 months if you had agreed to work on weekends, but still, it's great."
Ann Perkins,It's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the meeting's at 10:00, come over to my office for champagne after."
Ann Perkins,I don't think I should do that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh right, Mark. Oh, awkward."
Ann Perkins,I ended things with Mark a couple of days ago.
Ann Perkins,"And, I'm not gonna talk about it."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your final warning."
Tom Haverford,Do not miss tonight's April Ludgate birthday bash.
Tom Haverford,"9:00 P.M. at the world famous Snakehole Lounge, the place that the Pawnee Jounal has called the sexiest, most dangerous club in town."
Leslie Knope,That's not what they wrote.
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I added the world ""sexiest,"" but we've hired better security."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am a good friend for throwing the party."
Tom Haverford,"I'm also a genius, because I'm using the occasion to stock the club with every available hottie I know."
Tom Haverford,"Call me a romantic, but I believe by the end of the night, I will have between one and four new girlfriends."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I can't believe our little girl's all grown up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn the wheel of the world."
Leslie Knope,Why must it continually turn over?
Ron Swanson,Jack London.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go boss. We have a meeting to go to."
Ron Swanson,Yay.
Ron Swanson,"Once a year, every branch of this government meets in a room and announces what they intend to waste taxpayer money on."
Ron Swanson,"For a libertarian such as myself, it's philosophically horrifying. They also really cheap out on snacks."
Ron Swanson,Hydrax cookies? Did you know there was a off-brand Hydrox? I did not. They're not bad.
Paul,"Good morning, everybody."
Paul,"I know you all have your budget presentations ready, but there's a change of plans."
Paul,"Due to the crippling gridlock in City Council, we are postponing all planning and spending decisions indefinitely."
Leslie Knope,Until when?
Paul,Indefinitely.
Leslie Knope,And when will that end?
Paul,Later than now.
Leslie Knope,"So this week, probably?"
Paul,"Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie."
Paul,The state government is sending a team from Indianapolis to try to solve this budget problem.
Leslie Knope,"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat."""
Leslie Knope,Look I'm prepared for every sitautionâ¦ except for the one where there's no master plan.
Ron Swanson,Just calm down.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know what they're going to do.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, they're state auditors."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.
Leslie Knope,They're here to slash and burn.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'd be fine with that. This government is diseased."
Ron Swanson,"It's like a big, fat, angry slob spending money it doesn't have on crap it doesn't need."
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, me want more pointless social programs."
Ron Swanson,"Yummy, yummy, yum."
Leslie Knope,"That's what government does, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It provides services.
Leslie Knope,They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.
Leslie Knope,We got to fight these guys.
Ron Swanson,They've been sent by the Governor.
Ron Swanson,They outrank everyone.
Ron Swanson,There's no fight to be had here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to fight them.
Leslie Knope,Except that I am.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?"
Leslie Knope,"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies."
Ron Swanson,Go do that in your office.
Leslie Knope,Go do it in your office.
Ron Swanson,And we'll wait for these guys to show up.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait for you to show up.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to bring anything but your gorgeous body.
Tom Haverford,"And get this: cover charge is normally 15 dollars. Say my name at the door, it's 13.50."
Tom Haverford,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"You coming out tonight, part owner of the club?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, let me ask you a quick question."
Andy Dwyer,"What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?"
Tom Haverford,You know the old rule.
Tom Haverford,Half your age plus seven.
Andy Dwyer,Half my age plus seven.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm 29, so half of 29."
Andy Dwyer,Add seven.
Andy Dwyer,That's only 20... Is...
Tom Haverford,21
Andy Dwyer,20 years old.
Andy Dwyer,21
Tom Haverford,and a half.
Andy Dwyer,21 years old and a half.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,We got the same thing with the equation on that one.
Andy Dwyer,Here's the thing.
Andy Dwyer,What if she's slightly younger?
Andy Dwyer,Can I go out with someone younger than that?
Tom Haverford,"Please, you totally can."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Tom says it's okay.
Andy Dwyer,That probably means it isn't okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you for meeting with me again.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know really what I want to say.
Mark Brendanawicz,But I guess I just don't get it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, our relationship was so great."
Ann Perkins,"Mark, honestly, it was really nice."
Ann Perkins,"But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, but for example, we barely ever fought."
Ann Perkins,That's not a good sign.
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to fight sometimes.
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,And I just didn't feel that.
Ann Perkins,Did you?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Man, I should have yelled at you way more."
Ron Swanson,"Well, Paul just called."
Ron Swanson,They're on their way.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, God."
Jerry Gergich,"They're going to fire people, aren't they?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I am two years from my pension."
Leslie Knope,"Relax, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.
Extra,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Death!
Extra,Divorce filings?
Ron Swanson,Fourth floor.
Chris Traeger,"Hello, hello."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, how are you?"
Chris Traeger,"Hello, there."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,This is Ben.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, gents."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,It is fantastic to be here.
Leslie Knope,Would you gentlemen like a tour?
Chris Traeger,There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a great idea.
Chris Traeger,Let's do it!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun."
Chris Traeger,"People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis."
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,What does that mean?
Chris Traeger,"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget."
Chris Traeger,Think of the government as a broken down carousel.
Chris Traeger,"We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!"
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's not bad."
Chris Traeger,There it is.
Chris Traeger,"My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later."
Chris Traeger,Adios!
Ben Wyatt,Do you have a second?
Leslie Knope,I really like your shirt.
Ben Wyatt,So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.
Ron Swanson,Where do I start?
Leslie Knope,There is none.
Ron Swanson,What exactly will you be cutting?
Ron Swanson,And how much of it?
Ron Swanson,And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's start with personnel."
Ben Wyatt,What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?
Leslie Knope,He is one of the best people on the planet.
Leslie Knope,He's universally adored here.
Leslie Knope,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,You're a jerk.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings."
Ben Wyatt,This building has feelings?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of history in this one.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it does.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so blase about this?
Ben Wyatt,"Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms. Knope."
Ben Wyatt,Your government did.
Ben Wyatt,I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Looking hot, Big T."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Throw them bows-- What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Damn, girl, who are you trying to impress?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Just kidding.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I know.
April Ludgate,Walk away.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yep, you got it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Donna.
Donna Meagle,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Got you a birthday shot.
April Ludgate,"Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest."
Donna Meagle,Suit yourself.
Ann Perkins,I guess our awesome new park is on hold.
Ann Perkins,You have any idea what they're going to cut?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Ann Perkins,You know what? You shouldn't wait around.
Ann Perkins,You should come up with your own budget plan and just control your own destiny.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I just don't know if I can play God like that-- an angry vengeful God who just fires Jerry for no reason."
Ann Perkins,You'd fire Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Not necessarily.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It's just been a really crappy day.
Leslie Knope,Where were you earlier when I called?
Ann Perkins,Talking to Mark.
Leslie Knope,Again?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,It has been a rough week.
Leslie Knope,You want to get super drunk?
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Where's our lady?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I hope you all know I was instrumental in getting Trish crowned Miss Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,What was your talent again?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Looking amazing.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, ladies, is there anything you desire at all, besides me?"
Trish Ianetta,So funny.
Trish Ianetta,You are so funny!
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious, though."
Tom Haverford,Are you into me?
Trish Ianetta,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chug that, bitch!"
Ann Perkins,Rules are rules.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, listen to me. Listen to me, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I know I had a master plan, and it all blew up in my face, but youâ¦ You came into a town hall meeting, and we met, and we became friends, and that is awesome."
Ann Perkins,It is so awesome. You are so awesome. I love you.
Leslie Knope,"I love you too, but I need more beer."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm gonna get you more beer."
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Best friends of ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, April."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Let me see you.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Give me a twirl.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,This is beautiful.
April Ludgate,Don't look at me.
April Ludgate,"No, look at me."
Andy Dwyer,Happy birthday.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
Andy Dwyer,Or wait.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I can swing it."
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
April Ludgate,Whiskey.
April Ludgate,Neat.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,You're not messing around.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm not.
Andy Dwyer,Barkeep.
Ann Perkins,Andy Dwyer!
Ann Perkins,It's so awesome to see you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you, too."
Andy Dwyer,How are you?
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you a question.
Ann Perkins,Was I a good girlfriend?
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you were an awesome girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I was the screw-up."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you were."
Ann Perkins,"We had a good relationship, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"God, I think so."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, we fought a lot."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I know that.
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you something.
Ann Perkins,I'm hot.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a question?
Ann Perkins,When we were together-- I can't see you.
Ann Perkins,When we were together.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Were there times that you were like, ""If I don't see Ann in, like, 10 seconds, I'm gonna die""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, all the time."
Ann Perkins,I loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,Loved him.
Ann Perkins,Loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,He was a totally helpless baby when we met.
Ann Perkins,I dated him for three years.
Ann Perkins,"Now, he's an adult with a job."
Ann Perkins,And some other girl is going to reap the rewards of my hard work?
Ann Perkins,That's bull [bleep].
Tom Haverford,"And I'm reading this, and I'm like, ""How could they hurt those gorillas like that?"""
Tom Haverford,"They're such gentle, magnificent creatures, you know?"
Tom Haverford,I'm an animal lover.
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I want you to keep this bottle cap."
Tom Haverford,So you always remember me and the first time we met.
Tom Haverford,Classic game.
Tom Haverford,Plant the seed.
Tom Haverford,"Harvest, like, a half hour later."
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry that took forever.
Andy Dwyer,God.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hey, baby, you miss me?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Because I missed you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, look at this."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Andy.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's an all right name.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's an all right name.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Are you guys-- Are you guys hanging out together?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, maybe."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yep.
April Ludgate,"You know, he asked me out so many times."
April Ludgate,I guess he wore me down.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm very persistent.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come over here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come over here.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come on.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"One time, I waited outside a woman's house for five days just to show her how serious I was about wanting to drill her."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Turns out it was the wrong house.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"She loved the story, anyway."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We got to third base.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Over the pants.
April Ludgate,That's so cute.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, super cute."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Right?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you want a Remy Martin?
Andy Dwyer,Probably good.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, I'll get you one."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Two Remy Martins!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Here we go!
Andy Dwyer,You can have my Remy Martin for your birthday.
Andy Dwyer,I thought she liked me.
Andy Dwyer,I guess I'm super bad at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer,That Ralph Macchio guy is a total douche.
Tom Haverford,Did I give you a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, did I give you a bottle cap?"
Extra,What?
Tom Haverford,Did I give any of you guys a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,You sure?
Tom Haverford,Who the [bleep] did I give a bottle cap to?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This party sucks.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let's get out of here.
April Ludgate,It's my birthday party.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It is?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm sorry, boo."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not saying we're the best band in the universe, but we are, I would say, honestly, the best band in the world."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I should write an article about you-- another article about you.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, okay. Hey, can I buy you a drink?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah? Do you have a tab I could put it on?
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, how old are you?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,25
Andy Dwyer,"Mark! Brendanawicz, hey. What's 25 divided by 2 plus 7?"
Mark Brendanawicz,19 and a half.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm older than that."
Andy Dwyer,We're good to go.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, this is my dear friend, Mark Brendanawicz."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, we actually, uh, met."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, duh! Yeah, you guys totally slept together."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll take that drink.
Mark Brendanawicz,So you're with Andy now?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's been a great week.
Leslie Knope,You know what's thirsty?
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,You know what's weird?
Leslie Knope,How thirsty I get when I'm weird.
Leslie Knope,When I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, the jerk, is here."
Ann Perkins,Who are?
Leslie Knope,That one.
Leslie Knope,The one coming over here.
Leslie Knope,Get ready.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie, be professional."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot."
Ben Wyatt,So I just wanted to stop by and--
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, save your breath."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Just get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here."
Ben Wyatt,That must have taken awhile.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it did. You're a cold, callous person, and you want to kill people with machetes."
Leslie Knope,"And Ann is right, I should make my own plan, so that you can't hurt us, and that's what I'm gonna do."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Then I'll just see you tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to bother you.
Leslie Knope,Get out of here.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,That was so professional.
Ann Perkins,I'm so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,You have to help me.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,But you have to help me.
Ann Perkins,I think I may have made out with someone last night.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Who?
Ann Perkins,I don't remember.
Ann Perkins,I don't even know if it happened.
Ann Perkins,I just had this feeling when I woke up this morning like I definitely kissed somebody.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Ann."
Jerry Gergich,"Wow, that was a crazy night last night."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, crazy."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, I left at 11:15, and you were still raging pretty hard."
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So it's not Jerry.
Ann Perkins,Help me.
Leslie Knope,I'll keep an ear to the ground.
Ron Swanson,Knope! My office.
Ann Perkins,That's loud.
Leslie Knope,Why the yelling?
Ron Swanson,Have a good night last night?
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Ron Swanson,Did you enjoy your second loud conversation with Ben?
Ron Swanson,The state auditor who holds your very fate in his hands like a tiny bird.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, he deserves it."
Leslie Knope,"He's cold and unfeeling, and I yelled at him. So what?"
Ron Swanson,"Believe me, I want this government cut to the bone. But I can't have you getting yourself fired, because then I'll have to acutally do stuff."
Ron Swanson,Go apologize.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have anything to apologize for."
Leslie Knope,"All I did was express myself, forcefully, drunkenly. And I spit on him a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll go apologize."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Welcome, welcome, welcome."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have a lot of bottles there.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Would you like a vitamin?
Chris Traeger,B12?
Chris Traeger,Evening primrose oil?
Chris Traeger,Willow bark?
Chris Traeger,Magnesium?
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Chris Traeger,You sure?
Chris Traeger,Really good for hangovers.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take one."
Chris Traeger,I take care of my body above all else.
Chris Traeger,"Diet, exercise, supplements, and positive thinking."
Chris Traeger,Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
Chris Traeger,I believe I am that human being.
Chris Traeger,So what brings you here so early?
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to speak to Ben, actually."
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna listen to some ocean sounds and do some chin-ups.
Leslie Knope,So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I did was out of line."
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,"And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department."
Ben Wyatt,Your City Council and your Mayor are the threats to your department.
Ben Wyatt,"We didn't do anything to get you into this situation, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, really."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass."
Ben Wyatt,You want to get a beer?
Leslie Knope,It's like 10:30 in the morning.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,And you seem like you could use a beer.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get a beer.
Leslie Knope,Wellâ¦
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh."
Chris Traeger,Don't keep him too long.
Chris Traeger,I need someone to be here when I take my multivitamin.
Chris Traeger,There's a choking hazard.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, can we go?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"You don't remember anything that happened last night, do you?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"For once, it's Ann who blacked out drunk and not Andy."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,That's really dangerous.
Ann Perkins,Please tell me.
Andy Dwyer,This is going to be so fun letting you dangle until I finally reveal that we did not make out.
Andy Dwyer,Oh [bleep].
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,See you.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I need to settle my bill from last night."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Lucy,Okay.
Lucy,Wow.
Lucy,"You had 47 drinks last night? Ten cosmos, eight Smirnoff Ices, and everything else starts with the word pomegranate."
Lucy,Was it your bachelorette party?
Tom Haverford,"No, I invited a bunch of girls here last night, and they all put drinks on my tab."
Tom Haverford,And then I went home alone.
Tom Haverford,I'm not sure what happened.
Lucy,"You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them."
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.
Lucy,"I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way?"
Tom Haverford,That would have been a little out of control.
Lucy,But awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, the problem is I only have 15 penises, so There would have been 28 girls that were really upset with me."
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"All right, well, thanks."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, would you wanna get a drink tomorrow night?"
Lucy,Does it have to be here?
Tom Haverford,No.
Lucy,"Then, sure."
Lucy,I'm Lucy.
Lucy,Let me give you my phone number.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, I don't know what you were thinking."
Andy Dwyer,Just now? Nothing.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, I had a great time last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So are you free this weekend?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Shauna, look, I think you are a super cute person, and your newspaper articles are so cool, and they're probably very accurate."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't think we should go out romantically.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why not?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, honestly, because there's already a girl that I like."
Andy Dwyer,And we kind of have a long backstory of history.
Andy Dwyer,Andâ¦ I like her.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, good luck."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I can't even land the shoeshine guy.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that tastes really good."
Ben Wyatt,How's your head?
Leslie Knope,Mushy.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
Leslie Knope,All three times.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think you know anything about my department.
Leslie Knope,Have you ever been part of a government body before?
Ben Wyatt,"I have, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Small town called Partridge, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,Why does that sound familiar? You're Benji Wyatt?
Ben Wyatt,I am.
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town."
Ben Wyatt,And won.
Ben Wyatt,"A little bit of anti-establishment voter rebellion, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,"Here's the thing, though, about 18 year olds."
Ben Wyatt,They're idiots.
Ben Wyatt,So I pretty much ran the place into the ground after two months and got impeached.
Ben Wyatt,The worst part was my parents grounded me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You were so cute.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Leslie Knope,What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony?
Ben Wyatt,Whoomp! There it is.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,That's what it was.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"God, I was so jealous of you."
Ben Wyatt,You shouldn't have been.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible."
Ben Wyatt,"So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you want to run for office someday, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,How did you know?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"You have to be harsh, you know? No one's going to elect you to do anything if you don't show that you're a responsible grown-up."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Please, Mr. Mayor, let me."
Ben Wyatt,Whoomp there it is.

Chris Traeger,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,We'll talk later.
Leslie Knope,We should have a meeting to about things that happened in secret.
Leslie Knope,This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.
Leslie Knope,"And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services."
Chris Traeger,"Wow, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,But it's moot.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Chris Traeger,Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.
Leslie Knope,Meaning what?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Andy Dwyer,"November, you're beautiful, November, you're so serene, walk among the clouds, and see that you and me, were meant to be,"
Andy Dwyer,"November, your bangs are cute, November, your voice is a flute, November, let's pretend the sky is for us, Let's spread our wings and fly on a date, I want to go on a date with you, November."
Andy Dwyer,That song is about April.
