Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, you can't?"
Leslie Knope,"Look I am throwing a farewell party for my best friend, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago that she thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks."
Leslie Knope,Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.
Leslie Knope,It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.
Ann Perkins,I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
Ann Perkins,"I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and it's government owned and you need to do something about it."
Leslie Knope,I will help you.
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.
Leslie Knope,"I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!"
Leslie Knope,That was our biggest fight.
Harold,"Hey, Knope."
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Harold,You're breaking ground on the Pawnee commons tonight?
Harold,Public works never signed off on that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors."
Harold,I don't like it when people go over my head.
Leslie Knope,Understood.
Leslie Knope,I will make a note of that.
Leslie Knope,Would you like a treat?
Harold,I run that department and I do not appreciate--
Harold,"Damn, that's really good."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.
Leslie Knope,You should come by.
Harold,I know-- I get it.
Harold,I know what you're doing.
Harold,And I still-- is there a little crunch in there?
Leslie Knope,Hazelnut.
Harold,Ooh.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, right?"
Leslie Knope,See you tonight.
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, let's go set up this party."
Leslie Knope,"April, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care."
April Ludgate,Ann's leaving town and saying painful goodbyes to loved ones.
April Ludgate,Greatest day of my life!
Chris Traeger,Thank you all so much for helping me with these boxes.
Chris Traeger,"I'm just a little behind because every time I start, I get a little emotional."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, that box has my name on it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this one has my name on it."
Andy Dwyer,This one has plates' name on it.
Chris Traeger,You have just found your buddy boxes.
Chris Traeger,Each box contains a memento of our friendship.
Chris Traeger,"I was gonna give them to you later, but there is no time like the present."
Chris Traeger,Fun pun alert.
Ron Swanson,A bronzed hamburger.
Chris Traeger,"It's from our turkey versus beef cookoff, remember?"
Chris Traeger,You were a worthy adversary.
Ron Swanson,"I would have preferred a regular hamburger for eating, but this is very nice."
Ben Wyatt,2008 Indiana state audit spreadsheets?
Ben Wyatt,"Man, that year was insane!"
Chris Traeger,That was the year you went from being an auditor to a legend.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,A picture of me officiating Leslie and Ben's wedding.
Jerry Gergich,"And look, you can just about see my head."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,Snakejuice!
Tom Haverford,I thought these were destroyed by the FDA.
Chris Traeger,"I did have to go to a very seedy location to find it, but now I know where to go to place a bet on horse fighting."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann."
Leslie Knope,Repeat that back to me.
April Ludgate,"Tell Ann about the groundbreaking, frame Ann for murder, release a deadly virus into the water supply."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Bon voyage, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"My God, this is amazing."
Leslie Knope,That's sparkling cider.
Ann Perkins,Why is there a New Year's Eve countdown clock and the Easter bunny?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year."
Leslie Knope,"Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day."
Leslie Knope,Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.
Ann Perkins,"Knope, you have outknoped yourself."
April Ludgate,Seems like the party's dying down.
April Ludgate,Weird.
April Ludgate,"Ann, you probably wanna head to Michigan forever, so I snuck into your house and packed a bag for you."
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ann Perkins,This is just a bunch of bras and knives.
Ann Perkins,And loose onions.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, party!"
Leslie Knope,Don't drink!
Leslie Knope,Have fun!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so we have a little farewell gift for you."
Ben Wyatt,"We all pitched in and got you a gift card from that home store, ""Pots and Pans."""
Chris Traeger,We have been on the prowl for some amazing pots.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that card's for three pans."
Chris Traeger,"Either way, this is great."
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,"We should get to the goodbye party, although I know it's mostly for Ann."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but there's, like, one corner for you and it's just carob cookies and berries."
Chris Traeger,Carob cookies and berries are literally my favorite dessert alternative.
Chris Traeger,I'll go get changed.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, he put a lot of work into our presents."
Ben Wyatt,I feel kinda bad just getting him a gift card.
Ron Swanson,I also shook his hand.
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Ron Swanson,Anything more than that would be excessive.
Tom Haverford,Let's all put our heads together and brainstorm.
Tom Haverford,We gotta send this dude off with the perfect gift.
Tom Haverford,"I say we start with the three ""Cs,"" cashmere, concert tickets, caboodles of cash."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like those are perfect gifts for you.
Tom Haverford,Those are perfect gifts for anyone.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!"
Ann Perkins,I'm 100% sure that I will not meet another Donna Meagle in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna miss you.
Donna Meagle,"You know, I'm gonna miss you too, Perkins."
Donna Meagle,"But now that you're officially out of the dating pool, you know I'm gonna run this town, right?"
Donna Meagle,Ooh.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, you do not wanna go down that road."
Ann Perkins,"Trust me, I tried."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Stephen."
Extra,"Hey, Ann."
Extra,Super cute baby bump.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Donna Meagle,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, have you seen April?"
Ron Swanson,I've been mostly focused on these ribs.
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're out of Easter ham and Thanksgiving turkey."
Ron Swanson,Great party.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you on the lot?
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
April Ludgate,"Uh, not really."
April Ludgate,"Public works put up a giant padlock on the fence and a sign that says ""No trespassing."""
Leslie Knope,That probably doesn't apply to us.
April Ludgate,"There's also a sign that says ""Especially Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name."
Leslie Knope,There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,They probably mean him.
Leslie Knope,Do they mean the professor?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, there's a picture of you also."
April Ludgate,And two huge security guards.
Leslie Knope,Holy mother of Malia!
Leslie Knope,And Sasha.
Leslie Knope,I love them both equally.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this."
Leslie Knope,Get here and we will make a plan.
Orin,How long do I have to do this?
Leslie Knope,"Until I say so, Orin!"
Leslie Knope,Stay in character.
Ann Perkins,Leslie can't watch anything with Julie Andrews in it before bedtime because it gets her too hyper.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"If Chris gets cranky around noon, just stuff some chia seeds into a fig works every time."
Ann Perkins,"Awesome, thank you."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, we really picked some intense people to spend our lives with, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen her in a while.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, she's just running around trying to pull off an elaborate, thoughtful surprise for you."
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Chris?
Ann Perkins,"""I told him that One Headlight By the Wallflowers isn't ""dancing"" music and he said ""Not with that attitude."
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Ann, you know what I just remembered?"
Andy Dwyer,We used to date.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we lived together for two years."
Andy Dwyer,"I know, it's crazy, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, you're the best."
Andy Dwyer,Have fun in Mexico.
Leslie Knope,"Harold, it is Leslie Knope again."
Leslie Knope,"I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac;k-- And his voicemail is full."
Leslie Knope,Did you have any luck?
Ben Wyatt,Flipped through the bylaws.
Ben Wyatt,I don't think there's anything I can do.
Leslie Knope,What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?
Ben Wyatt,Hopefully there are a few other reasons.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we hit a wall.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
April Ludgate,I'm just so scared that this means that Ann won't really leave.
Tom Haverford,"Life, huh?"
Tom Haverford,It's quite a ride.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Tom, it is."
Tom Haverford,I got you a going away present.
Tom Haverford,I'm deleting you from my phone.
Tom Haverford,You're finally free of my animal magnetism.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe one day years from now when we're both old and Chris is dead, you'll run into me somewhere."
Tom Haverford,I'll be opening my latest mega club.
Tom Haverford,"I'll see you there on the street by yourself and I'll tell the bouncer/my bodyguard, ""Hey, that woman's way too old to get into this club, but why don't you let her in the back?"""
Ann Perkins,That's very generous.
Tom Haverford,"Stay golden, sweetheart."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna miss you too, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Shh.
Jerry Gergich,And you're kind and you're thoughtful and you're always such a delight to have around.
Jerry Gergich,I am sure you are going to be an incredible mother.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Larry."
Ann Perkins,That's nice.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Ann."
Ron Swanson,I have enjoyed parts of our time together.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,That was really something.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what do we have for Chris?"
Andy Dwyer,I got this City of Pawnee mug.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, this cool jacket."
Jerry Gergich,"No, I think that's Chris's jacket."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, good, then we know he likes it."
Andy Dwyer,"Catch up, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I found some old receipts from lunches we had together."
Ben Wyatt,Is that anything?
Ron Swanson,This is my contribution.
Ron Swanson,"It says ""Ron."""
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we're just giving you a bunch of cool gifts."
Ben Wyatt,"No, God oh God."
Andy Dwyer,"Get your hopes up, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Let's see what's in here.
Chris Traeger,Some assorted items.
Chris Traeger,And some pieces of paper.
Andy Dwyer,"Boom, nailed it."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Now we can start enjoying this party.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is the most incredible event that has ever been thrown."
Ann Perkins,There is a pilgrim line dancing with a box of candies.
Ann Perkins,Why do you look so bummed out?
Leslie Knope,We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together."
Leslie Knope,But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.
Leslie Knope,He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"First of all, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins,"And second of all, screw Harold."
Ann Perkins,"If I learned one thing from Leslie Knope it is we do not take ""No"" for an answer."
Ann Perkins,Anything is possible if we work hard enough.
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann Perkins to the rescue.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hands in, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Groundbreaking!
Ann Perkins,Let's go!
April Ludgate,"Dark forces, arise!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say."
Leslie Knope,That's my bad.
Leslie Knope,"Here we go, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, knock or ring the bell?"
Ann Perkins,Bust in unannounced.
Leslie Knope,Love it!
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Harold,"What the hell, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.
Harold,You snuck around behind my back.
Harold,I told you I didn't like that.
Harold,Forget it.
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Harold, look."
Ann Perkins,This is a great opportunity you have right now.
Ann Perkins,Just think of us as your genies who can give you anything you want.
Ann Perkins,Nothing gross.
Harold,"Okay, yeah, there is something I want."
Harold,Super fizzy fruity pop.
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Harold,"Sweetums used to stock our office with free sodas as a promotional thing, but that Kathryn Pinewood lady just took 'em away."
Harold,"If you can get us our free sodas back, I'll get you a key."
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Leslie Knope,Easy.
Leslie Knope,It is not easy.
Leslie Knope,Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.
Ann Perkins,"Well, luckily, you're with the person on earth who loves you the most."
Ann Perkins,Too cheesy?
Leslie Knope,"No, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Don't leave.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Chris Traeger,"Donna, you are a remarkable woman, and I just wanted to say that I've always thought of you as family."
Donna Meagle,I just wanna say that I've always thought you were hot.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I know."
Chris Traeger,April--
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you saw a lot of potential in me, I'm like a daughter to you, and it was a treat to watch me blossom."
April Ludgate,"Blah blah blah, bye."
Chris Traeger,That is remarkably close to what I was going to say.
Chris Traeger,"Also, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Donna, are you grabbing my butt?"
Donna Meagle,Can you blame me?
Chris Traeger,No!
Kathryn Pinewood,"Sorry, can't help you ladies."
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't have time for disgraced former politicians and unmarried preggos.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Kathryn, always a delight."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know that you and Leslie have had your disagreements in the past, but we really need the key, and we can only get the key if we get the sodas."
Ann Perkins,Please?
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't see why I should do you any favors.
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, if you were still a city councilor, maybe."
Kathryn Pinewood,But I seem to remember you were recalled.
Kathryn Pinewood,Is that right?
Leslie Knope,How dare you--
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Please.
Ann Perkins,It's not worth it.
Ann Perkins,For you.
Ann Perkins,"For me, I don't care."
Kathryn Pinewood,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pinewood, that's right."
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant and I have you in a headlock.
Ann Perkins,"And if you try to fight back, I will sue you."
Ann Perkins,Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Okay, fine."
Kathryn Pinewood,Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.
Kathryn Pinewood,"So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Perkins."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?"
Pete Disellio,They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.
Pete Disellio,"I said ""No."""
Pete Disellio,They want me dunking on the label.
Pete Disellio,When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?
Leslie Knope,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.
Pete Disellio,"It's called ""Sweetums dunktastic threepoint Bball blast"" the slogan is ""It's all about basketball."""
Pete Disellio,"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean."
Leslie Knope,"We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?"
Perd Hapley,"I'm sorry, Miss Knope."
Perd Hapley,"There is such a thing as journalistic integrity, and it is something that I have as a journalist with integrity."
Ann Perkins,"It's really important, Perd."
Ann Perkins,Please?
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,For old time's sake.
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of that appeal is it was heartfelt."
Perd Hapley,"And in response to that appeal, I respond: Okay."
Leslie Knope,For old time's sake?
Leslie Knope,Does that mean-- no!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky minx."
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,I went on a date with Perd.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,"It was during that ""explore my freedom as a single woman"" phase."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ann Perkins,We just had a drink.
Ann Perkins,"And at the end he said, ""I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth."""
Ann Perkins,And then I ran away.
Leslie Knope,It was absolutely the right call.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice."
Tom Haverford,Tell the truth?
Tom Haverford,That's hilarious.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint."
Tom Haverford,"""Chris, he had a gun."""
Tom Haverford,"""He took all the gifts."""
Tom Haverford,"Now Chris feels bad, he's buying us gifts."
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, Tommy's got a new watch."
Ron Swanson,"Again, I don't see the problem."
Ron Swanson,I shook the man's hand.
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, look what I got at the president's day booth."
Chris Traeger,Ask not what your country can do for you.
Andy Dwyer,"From Family Guy, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, Chris, we have to tell you something."
Ben Wyatt,We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I don't need anything from you."
Chris Traeger,"My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future."
Chris Traeger,Because we're always gonna be friends.
Chris Traeger,And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.
Chris Traeger,To the future.
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear."
Ben Wyatt,To the future.
Tom Haverford,To the future.
Jerry Gergich,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Jerry Gergich,Future.
Harold,Don't you ladies ever knock?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Everything's here in writing.
Leslie Knope,Now call off your guards.
Harold,Okay.
Harold,Fine.
Harold,You two are a couple of real pains in the ass.
Harold,You know that?
Leslie Knope,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you."
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Harold."
Leslie Knope,Victory at last.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,All right.
April Ludgate,You're all set.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,It's for the raccoons.
Leslie Knope,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.
Leslie Knope,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish."
Ann Perkins,Pawnee raccoons.
Ann Perkins,That is one thing I will not miss.
April Ludgate,"Well, Michigan has wolverines."
April Ludgate,Maybe they'll eat your toes.
Ann Perkins,So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,We like it here.
April Ludgate,"I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100."
Ann Perkins,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm really happy that you and Andy are married."
April Ludgate,Why?
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,Because I love him and I love you.
Ann Perkins,Why wouldn't I be happy?
April Ludgate,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,What's that?
April Ludgate,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't-- I couldn't quite hear you.
April Ludgate,Please don't make me say it.
April Ludgate,Please.
Ann Perkins,My going away present to you will be that I do not make you audibly say that you love me.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie's coming back."
April Ludgate,"Get off me, wench!"
Leslie Knope,Did I miss a nice moment?
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, what are you doing here? Come in."
Chris Traeger,You caught me before my first run of the day.
Chris Traeger,"I call it my ""beat the sun"" run."
Chris Traeger,It's a race between me and the sun.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we got one more gift for you."
Ron Swanson,It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts.
Ron Swanson,Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.
Ron Swanson,"Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct."
Ron Swanson,It is gorgeous.
Ben Wyatt,"You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy."
Andy Dwyer,Or twizzlers.
Andy Dwyer,That's the beautiful thing about a box.
Tom Haverford,"We all burned our initials in, see?"
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, who's G-J-L-G-G?"
Jerry Gergich,That's Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch.
Jerry Gergich,I burned in all my names.
Jerry Gergich,I really-- I didn't know what to do.
Chris Traeger,"Well, um Thank you."
Chris Traeger,"Um, this tear, um, caused by the overwhelming thoughtfulness of my friends will be my baby's first memory."
Ron Swanson,Salt water will warp the wood.
Ron Swanson,So keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.
Chris Traeger,"Will do, Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?
Ann Perkins,Not if I call you first.
Leslie Knope,And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie?
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,You perfect sunflower.
Leslie Knope,"You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, how to be patient."
Ann Perkins,Mm
Leslie Knope,How to be more patient.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's better."
Leslie Knope,How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt."
Ann Perkins,It's just not your shape.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it."
Leslie Knope,Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.
Ann Perkins,We wait for no man.
Ann Perkins,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three!"
Ann Perkins,"One, two, three!"
Ann Perkins,"All right, I got my park."
Ann Perkins,That's all I wanted from you.
Ann Perkins,Friendship over.
Leslie Knope,"Don't even joke about that, Ann."
Chris Traeger,It was your idea to get me that box.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, it was a group effort."
Chris Traeger,But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful.
Chris Traeger,You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.
Ben Wyatt,"You too, man."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life-- that and working with Dr. Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,And I still think that.
Chris Traeger,Right.
Leslie Knope,"But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, this is normal."
Leslie Knope,No big deal.
Leslie Knope,Drive safe.
Ann Perkins,We will.
Leslie Knope,I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.
Leslie Knope,"So-- oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car."
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize."
Leslie Knope,Things are gonna get emotional.
Ann Perkins,I love you.
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Ron Swanson,"Breakfast, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.
Leslie Knope,That's fair.
Leslie Knope,Someone else is gonna have to drive though.
Leslie Knope,My eyes are basically useless right now.
Tom Haverford,I'm on it.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun! I called shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,You're all nailed.
April Ludgate,I call sitting on your lap.
Andy Dwyer,You can't-- I-- double shotgun! We call double shotgun! How come people don't do that more often?
Ben Wyatt,It's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Raise you hand if you want waffles.
Jerry Gergich,I'm eating waffles.
Ron Swanson,"Bacon and eggs, please and thank you."
