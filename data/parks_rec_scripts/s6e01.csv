Andy Dwyer,"Wait, I forgot!"
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?
Ron Swanson,What?
Andy Dwyer,I found a pregnancy test at your cabin and I checked with all the girls over there and wasn't any of them.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, darling, what a surprise."
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Can we talk?
Diane Lewis,Maybe in private.
Andy Dwyer,You and me?
Ron Swanson,"I believe she's referring to me, son."
Ron Swanson,Please excuse us.
Diane Lewis,So I am pregnant.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Diane Lewis,I don't understand how.
Diane Lewis,We were so careful.
Ron Swanson,I warned you about this.
Ron Swanson,Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.
Diane Lewis,"I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's what I'm thinking."
Ron Swanson,"I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe most likely in a canoe."
Ron Swanson,"I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any."
Diane Lewis,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Diane Lewis will you marry me?
Diane Lewis,Yes.
Diane Lewis,On one condition.
Ron Swanson,"Anything, my love."
Ron Swanson,"Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding."
Diane Lewis,Just the opposite.
Diane Lewis,We've both been married before.
Diane Lewis,I don't want anything big or elaborate.
Diane Lewis,"In fact, the smaller the better."
Diane Lewis,I assume you can deal with that.
Ron Swanson,Are you kidding?
Ron Swanson,"As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now."
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Diane Lewis,"Hey, Leslie."
Diane Lewis,What's with the getup?
Leslie Knope,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
April Ludgate,Where are you guys going?
Ron Swanson,"The fourth floor, getting married."
Leslie Knope,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, catch you later."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wha What who's what the
Ron Swanson,Are you dead?
Ron Swanson,You look like you're in rictus.
Leslie Knope,I justI'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Diane Lewis,Would you ladies like to come?
April Ludgate,Can I be the best man?
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!"
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake or a bouncy castle"
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you."
Ethel Beavers,What's the date of the wedding?
Ron Swanson,Today.
Diane Lewis,"It's a bit unusual, but we both"
Ethel Beavers,Don't care.
Diane Lewis,"Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor?"
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you have no idea what that means to me."
Ron Swanson,She gets it.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness."
Leslie Knope,I need to get some flowers.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?
Leslie Knope,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice."
Leslie Knope,Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?
April Ludgate,I found a justice guy.
April Ludgate,These are the marrying people.
April Ludgate,This is Carl.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Carl."
Ron Swanson,"My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here."
Extra,Haven't I done a quickie wedding for you before?
Ron Swanson,"It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick."
Ethel Beavers,I need your full names for the license.
Ron Swanson,Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Diane Lewis,Diane Tammy Lewis.
Ron Swanson,Tammy?
Ron Swanson,Your middle name is
Diane Lewis,"Just kidding, it's Elizabeth."
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Carl."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Carl."
Ron Swanson,Shortest possible ceremony.
Ron Swanson,I'm tired of not being married to this woman.
Extra,"Do you, Ron Swanson, take Diane to be your wife?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's going to start!"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's happening!"
Ron Swanson,I certainly do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Extra,"And do you, Diane, take Yes!"
Diane Lewis,"Yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,She said yes!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Extra,By the power vested in me
Leslie Knope,"Before you Carl, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to give a short speech, if I may."
Ron Swanson,You have ten seconds.
Leslie Knope,"At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines ""friend"""
Ron Swanson,Time.
Leslie Knope,It's ugh!
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful."
Extra,I now pronounce you
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Extra,man and wife.
Leslie Knope,Hooray!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ron Swanson,"Great job, everyone."
Ron Swanson,"The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone."
Leslie Knope,Pretend this is rice!
Leslie Knope,That was beautiful.
Leslie Knope,The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
All,Recall Knope!
All,Recall Knope!
Harris,Legalize weed!
Leslie Knope,"Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle."
Leslie Knope,"The clue ""Who's the worst,"" but you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We're fighting back.
Leslie Knope,I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
Leslie Knope,"We are currently in phase 26: ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,"Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?"
Gretel,There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.
Gretel,I want them gone but not killed I love animals.
Gretel,But get rid of them.
Gretel,They're gross.
Gretel,But make sure they're happy but not too happy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're on it, because ""No problem too small."""
Ann Perkins,So what now?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Mm.
Chris Traeger,How's the recall fight going?
Leslie Knope,This person to person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Ann Perkins,"Well, as a wise woman once said to me, ""Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnut haired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan."""
Leslie Knope,"Good memory, sunfish."
Leslie Knope,Let's press on.
Leslie Knope,I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Chris Traeger,Someone has a slug infestation?
Chris Traeger,"Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges."
Chris Traeger,"Life is precious, and every day is a miracle."
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What a freak.
Ann Perkins,Things with me and Chris are going really well.
Ann Perkins,"We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun."
Ann Perkins,And check this out.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, there's no ring."
Ann Perkins,We just had manicures together recently.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, that was misleading."
Trevor Nelson,"Ah, Mr. Haverford, back again, I see."
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, man?"
Tom Haverford,This looks exactly like my store!
Trevor Nelson,I know.
Trevor Nelson,My client is a very determined businessman.
Trevor Nelson,"When he rips someone off, he goes all the way."
Trevor Nelson,"You see, you are Hydrox, Mr. Haverford."
Trevor Nelson,We are Oreo.
Tom Haverford,"Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy."
Tom Haverford,I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.
Trevor Nelson,Mm.
Tom Haverford,He must be one heck of a transporter.
Trevor Nelson,"My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking."
Tom Haverford,Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rentaswag to try to put me out of business.
Tom Haverford,"I'm not worried, though."
Tom Haverford,I've poured my heart and soul into my store.
Tom Haverford,I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Lebron James.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers."
Ben Wyatt,"I agree, we need something massive and attention getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning."
Ann Perkins,I got it!
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I just I got a fly."
April Ludgate,I have something.
April Ludgate,"Remember phase 13, ""Think outside of the box""?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,It was an amazing phase.
Ben Wyatt,Easily a top five phase.
April Ludgate,"Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award."
April Ludgate,"It's called ""The International Coalition of Women in Government,"" and you won."
April Ludgate,"There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God, this is real."
Chris Traeger,I just assumed you were lying.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, but yeah, it's real."
April Ludgate,"Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think."
Leslie Knope,Janet Napoli freaking tano?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is amazing and perfect.
Leslie Knope,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention."
Leslie Knope,When is the ceremony?
April Ludgate,Next month in London.
Leslie Knope,London?
Ben Wyatt,London?
Leslie Knope,We're going to London?
Leslie Knope,"We're going to London, you guys!"
Andy Dwyer,I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's Buckingham Palace."
Ben Wyatt,Hogwarts is fictional.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know that?
Ben Wyatt,It's important to me that you know that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today."
Leslie Knope,"Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history."
Ron Swanson,"History began on July 4, 1776."
Ron Swanson,Everything before that was a mistake.
Ron Swanson,"Diane suggested we ""tag along to London"" for a honeymoon."
Ron Swanson,"I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe."
Ron Swanson,"Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her."
Ron Swanson,"All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting."
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you're in London."
Ben Wyatt,"You're 4,000 miles away from home."
Ben Wyatt,"Try to enjoy this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right, as usual."
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ooh, hold on, actually."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hang on.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yeah, no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I want to quit and never come here again.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, bye."
Tom Haverford,I can't believe I used to date you!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tommy Pickles!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You see there's a better version of your store across the street?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"And those guys are giving out free pizza with ""papperonas."""
Tom Haverford,"I know, man."
Tom Haverford,That's my competition.
Tom Haverford,"They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working."
Tom Haverford,"Three weeks ago, this place was hopping."
Tom Haverford,My clothes were flying off the rack.
Tom Haverford,I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.
Tom Haverford,"Now, look at this place."
Tom Haverford,It's dead!
Tom Haverford,What am I gonna do?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"It's like I always say, okay?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing."
Tom Haverford,That's not a good piece of advice.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,So I'ma throw up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I ate too much cheese.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll talk to you!
Tom Haverford,I need some better friends.
Ben Wyatt,So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month."
Ben Wyatt,How much beer were you drinking?
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Probably too much.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our afterschool music program, and British people love me."
Ben Wyatt,"There was this British kid in my high school who always called me ""Big Ben"" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, ""Bong! Bong! Bo"""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, he might have hated me."
Andy Dwyer,"Real quick, should I do a British accent?"
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I'm gonna say no."
Andy Dwyer,You sure?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I can do one.
Andy Dwyer,"It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off."
Andy Dwyer,I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.
Ben Wyatt,He knows we're American.
Andy Dwyer,"Ugh, great."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway."
Andy Dwyer,"After all, we did come all the way down under."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir."
Lord Covington,"Well, it's nice to meet you too."
Lord Covington,"However, the proper mode of address would be ""Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, ""14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, 29th Baron of Hertfordshire."""
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, I'm kidding."
Lord Covington,I'm kidding.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Lord Covington,"Please, call me Eddie."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name."
Lord Covington,"Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea."
Lord Covington,Shall we?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your pick."
Ron Swanson,"Look, a clock."
Ron Swanson,We don't have that in America.
Ron Swanson,You call that a tower?
Ron Swanson,"Try the Sears Tower, friend."
Ron Swanson,"""London at night."""
Ron Swanson,That is very funny.
Extra,"Can I help you, sir?"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I will take this.
Extra,"We don't accept American currency, sir."
Ron Swanson,Of course you do.
Ron Swanson,That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.
Ron Swanson,Accept it.
Extra,"Very sorry, sir."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby."
Tom Haverford,"You really think this will work, Donna?"
Donna Meagle,Why wouldn't it?
Donna Meagle,We just pull the business license it's public information and then at least you'll have an address.
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, here."
Donna Meagle,"Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation called ""Open 4 Business, LLC."""
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane."
Tom Haverford,Done and done.
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"""1020 Maple Street."""
Tom Haverford,Ann and Chris?
Tom Haverford,What are they doing here?
Extra,"Sir, you can't go in there!"
Tom Haverford,Aha!
Tom Haverford,I caught you!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, it's Tom!"
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Tom Haverford,What am I doing?
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,"Dr. Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,You're JeanRalphio's dad!
Dr. Saperstein,Mmhmm.
Tom Haverford,You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, look at that, Mr. Haverford."
Dr. Saperstein,You tracked me down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, high end fashion rental skills."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?"
Chris Traeger,"No, you certainly cannot."
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, why are you doing this?"
Tom Haverford,What did I ever do to you?
Dr. Saperstein,You know exactly why I'm doing this.
Dr. Saperstein,You destroyed my family.
Dr. Saperstein,"First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, you're serious?"
Dr. Saperstein,Deadly serious.
Dr. Saperstein,"According to my daughter, you broke her heart."
Dr. Saperstein,Then you smashed up her BMW.
Dr. Saperstein,"I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School."
Dr. Saperstein,"Let me tell you something, mister."
Dr. Saperstein,"You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath."
Dr. Saperstein,"Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat."
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Dr. Saperstein,Everything sounds perfect.
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Chris Traeger,This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.
Chris Traeger,And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.
Ben Wyatt,"So this after school music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can"
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Are those I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Are those remote control helicopters?
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Lord Covington,I got them as a gift.
Lord Covington,"I bought them for one of my nephews, and then I decided to keep them."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Lord Covington,Would you like to play with them?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, would I?"
Andy Dwyer,I call blue one!
Lord Covington,I call the oh.
Lord Covington,"Okay, you get the blue one."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.
Andy Dwyer,"What are you talking about, dude?"
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Lord Covington,He called it.
Andy Dwyer,That's the rule.
Lord Covington,That's the rule.
Lord Covington,"Anyway, the orange one's better."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Lord Covington,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Lord Covington,"Hey, get off!"
Lord Covington,"Okay, watch out!"
Lord Covington,Watch out!
Lord Covington,Agh!
Andy Dwyer,Ohh!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, awesome."
Andy Dwyer,I think I broke mine!
Lord Covington,"Oh, bummer."
Andy Dwyer,"So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?"
Lord Covington,"Well, no, not everything."
Lord Covington,"We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one."
Lord Covington,We don't own that.
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, actually, we do own that."
Andy Dwyer,What else does your family own?
Lord Covington,"Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?"
Ben Wyatt,"As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a wide reaching international program."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, you know what I want?"
Andy Dwyer,Ice cream.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you guys have that here, ice cream?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's so good."
Andy Dwyer,You have to get it.
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone."
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Do you have that here?
Lord Covington,We have it.
Lord Covington,Of course we have it.
Andy Dwyer,You have it?
Lord Covington,"Where do you think you are, the moon?"
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome if we were.
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Can we get some?
Andy Dwyer,Could we do could we have some?
Lord Covington,Could we?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Lord Covington,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,Just what do I do with this?
Lord Covington,Just throw it there.
Lord Covington,Roger will pick it up.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"""So I long for a day when women in government will simply be seen as people in government, but until then, I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be."""
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
April Ludgate,"I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I want to know what's happening there.
Leslie Knope,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Perd Hapley,Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.
Perd Hapley,"Ms. Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What now?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light."
Kathryn Pinewood,"We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?"
Kathryn Pinewood,She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.
Leslie Knope,How how did they get that picture so
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Leslie Knope,But I just put
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Leslie Knope,But isn't it a
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in."
Perd Hapley,"Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,You're leaving tonight?
Ron Swanson,I can't believe there's even a flight?
Leslie Knope,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.M. back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned."
Leslie Knope,Easy breezy!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now."
Ron Swanson,You flew all this way.
Ron Swanson,Have some perspective.
Leslie Knope,You have some perspective!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're right.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'm stressed.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to calm down."
Leslie Knope,Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, who is that?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My dad said that?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, JeanRalphio."
Tom Haverford,He told me that I had screwed you out of my business
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Tom Haverford,So he was gonna screw me back.
Tom Haverford,Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That is so weird.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is so oh, you know what?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I actually told him that RentASwag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.
Tom Haverford,Why would you say that?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh and I don't know if this is relevant
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's probably not relevant, though."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"It's probably not relevant, though."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I don't know I guess
Tom Haverford,All this lying about me stops now!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,This is my life.
Tom Haverford,"Please, one of you has to tell him the truth."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Not it!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Not it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Ooh, you got me!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Whoa ho!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, fine."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You know what?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna do the unthinkable.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a big cheering section."
April Ludgate,"Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia."
April Ludgate,"She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler."
April Ludgate,I love her.
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, hi."
Ulee Danssen,You must be Leslie Knope.
Ulee Danssen,I'm Ulee Danssen.
Ulee Danssen,I'm one of the honorees.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at your face."
Ulee Danssen,What?
Leslie Knope,It's just so symmetrical.
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, thanks!"
Ulee Danssen,"You know, we all have that in Denmark."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're from Denmark, of course."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?"
Ulee Danssen,I'm from Silkeborg.
Ulee Danssen,You know.
Ulee Danssen,"It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me."
Ulee Danssen,And look what they've done for me.
Leslie Knope,They made a statue of you!
Ulee Danssen,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Is that goat cheese?
Ulee Danssen,"Good cheese eye, Leslie."
Ulee Danssen,It is made out of goat cheese.
Ulee Danssen,"We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers."
Ulee Danssen,They just love me.
Ulee Danssen,What about your town?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to kick me out of office.
Leslie Knope,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?"
Ulee Danssen,"I don't, no."
April Ludgate,So you're from Mongolia?
April Ludgate,Will you take me with you when you go back there?
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,Did you understand that?
April Ludgate,Did you bring any wolverines?
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Lord Covington,Aluminium.
Lord Covington,"Okay, okay."
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Andy Dwyer,"It's ""alumilum."""
Lord Covington,"""Alumilum""?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Alumilum!
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program, I would be happy to"
Lord Covington,Mmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,"But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there."
Lord Covington,"Yes, of course."
Lord Covington,"The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing."
Andy Dwyer,Me neither.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Lord Covington,My family has a huge amount of money.
Lord Covington,"We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land."
Lord Covington,"Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Lord Covington,It was awesome.
Lord Covington,"There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yoyo."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, do you do you have it here?"
Ben Wyatt,Guys
Lord Covington,"The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad."
Andy Dwyer,"If I may, ours is great."
Lord Covington,Brilliant!
Lord Covington,I'm in.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you serious?
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,"I like you, I like music."
Andy Dwyer,"On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, that actually may be tough."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to"
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Lord Covington,"No, no, I meant Andy."
Lord Covington,I want Andy to stay.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a goose that just flew by the window?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's a plastic bag."
Andy Dwyer,Did you see that?
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did I interrupt?"
Andy Dwyer,What are you guys talking about?
Lord Covington,Let's see if it was a goose.
Andy Dwyer,"I think it could have been, honest to God."
Ulee Danssen,"Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved."
Ulee Danssen,"Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me."
Ulee Danssen,"It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How was your meeting?
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I'll fill you in later.
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready for your speech?
Leslie Knope,Uh yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Extra,"Thank you, Ulee."
Extra,It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.
Extra,"Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women."
Leslie Knope,You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're just truly"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I've been a public servant for a long time."
Leslie Knope,And you know how I spend my days?
Leslie Knope,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
Leslie Knope,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?"
Leslie Knope,By hating me.
Leslie Knope,They hate me.
Leslie Knope,They want to recall me.
Leslie Knope,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
Ulee Danssen,You're always welcome in Silkeborg!
Ulee Danssen,"Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie."
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there."
Leslie Knope,"I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks."
Leslie Knope,"The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm sick of it."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepee-heads.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much for this amazing award.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I said ""peepee-heads."""
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,That's my boss!
Ben Wyatt,"That speech was a little rough, don't you think?"
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, it's how I feel."
Leslie Knope,"Stupid, ungrateful town."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it's Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry who?
Jerry Gergich,Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Jer oh, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why are you calling me?"
Leslie Knope,I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee."
Jerry Gergich,Everyone saw it.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?"
Jerry Gergich,"I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced."
Jerry Gergich,"She's calling it the ""Peepee-head"" speech."
Leslie Knope,"Bloody hell, Jerry!"
Jerry Gergich,So how's Lond
Chris Traeger,I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.
Chris Traeger,It's a very special day.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Donna."
Ann Perkins,So
Donna Meagle,You're pregnant.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, Tom told you."
Donna Meagle,Nope.
Donna Meagle,"You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empire waist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling."
Donna Meagle,"I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks."
Chris Traeger,"My goodness, you're observant."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am."
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Donna Meagle,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?
Chris Traeger,Yesterday.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, please stop looking at him."
Leslie Knope,Why are we here?
Ron Swanson,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here."
Ron Swanson,"When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back."
Ron Swanson,You have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,But it's so hard!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,And nobody ever thanks you.
Ron Swanson,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you."
Ron Swanson,"And by the way, April thanked you."
Ron Swanson,She nominated you for this award.
Leslie Knope,"Well, April does that all the time."
Leslie Knope,She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
Ron Swanson,"April respects you, and so do many others."
Ron Swanson,Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.
Ron Swanson,That way lies madness.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I almost forgot."
Leslie Knope,"I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many."
Ron Swanson,A train ticket?
Ron Swanson,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you do."
Leslie Knope,"If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?"
Leslie Knope,"This is London, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops."
Ron Swanson,"Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,I didn't know you were working today.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away."
Jerry Gergich,"Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint--"
Chris Traeger,That's great.
Chris Traeger,"Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting."
Chris Traeger,"Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, there's so much in front of you."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!"
Ann Perkins,That sounds terrible.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,I'm very sad.
Chris Traeger,Please stop talking.
Jerry Gergich,"And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in."
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Jerry Gergich,That is exciting.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think."
Jerry Gergich,The babies can sense it.
Jerry Gergich,"You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple."
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,"Gimme, gimme."
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,I want milk!
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,Ohh.
Jerry Gergich,Life is a miracle.
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm."
April Ludgate,So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I can't do it, obviously."
April Ludgate,Why?
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what I would be doing.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, besides, this is England."
Andy Dwyer,Everything is so weird.
Andy Dwyer,It's all different.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road."
Andy Dwyer,Do they?
Andy Dwyer,I'll be damned.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, like that."
Andy Dwyer,That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.
Andy Dwyer,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?
Andy Dwyer,Not even a circus.
Andy Dwyer,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns."
Andy Dwyer,One bearded lady.
Andy Dwyer,She got all rude when I marveled at her.
April Ludgate,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he's awesome."
Andy Dwyer,He's everything you would want in a boss.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny."
Andy Dwyer,Total package.
April Ludgate,I think you should do it.
April Ludgate,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?
Andy Dwyer,I mean
April Ludgate,"And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Remember, I was in Washington last year."
Andy Dwyer,He said he wanted me to head up the company.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.
April Ludgate,"Come on, you can hack this."
April Ludgate,I believe in you.
April Ludgate,"But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies."
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the only logical solution.
Chris Traeger,"My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant."
Chris Traeger,And I'm the baby daddy!
Ethel Beavers,How wonderful for you.
Chris Traeger,You don't seem very excited for us.
Ethel Beavers,"I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work."
Ann Perkins,"Man, I thought this would be more satisfying."
Chris Traeger,I agree.
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."
Leslie Knope,"This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go."
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna let you go.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work."
Leslie Knope,"Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods."
Ann Perkins,That's for a hangover.
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah, of course."
Leslie Knope,I'm so goofed-up right now.
Leslie Knope,I'm so jet-lagged.
Leslie Knope,"I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."
Leslie Knope,"So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."
Leslie Knope,"Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding."
Leslie Knope,I know it's Ann.
Chris Traeger,We are so glad you're back.
Chris Traeger,"We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for."
Ann Perkins,"And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones."
Leslie Knope,Ohh.
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, welcome home!"
Leslie Knope,Don't pinch me!
Tom Haverford,"Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting."
Tom Haverford,It's really a dream come true.
Tom Haverford,"Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening."
Dr. Saperstein,"So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is!"
Dr. Saperstein,"So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Trophies I bought
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I also have something to say.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life."
Dr. Saperstein,I know this and I love you.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you too, daddy."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please! My money."
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, your son is my best friend."
Dr. Saperstein,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,He's like a brother to me.
Tom Haverford,"But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mm.
Tom Haverford,On an island
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,In space.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hold on
Dr. Saperstein,These two have been huge disappointments to me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Come on, you love us."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Dad!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"But seriously, what are we doing here, though?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are we doing here, dad?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Like, what is this?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we here?
Tom Haverford,So So now you know the truth.
Tom Haverford,Will you back off?
Dr. Saperstein,"No, I will not stop."
Dr. Saperstein,"Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now."
Dr. Saperstein,"Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off."
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yes, daddy."
Dr. Saperstein,Huh? Blow me a kiss.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Mwah!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mwah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,#NAME?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!"
Dr. Saperstein,Me too.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we'll be fine."
April Ludgate,Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here?
Leslie Knope,April
April Ludgate,What? I don't trust him.
April Ludgate,I never have.
April Ludgate,He's after your money.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,"And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy."
Leslie Knope,"Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world."
Leslie Knope,"Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."
Leslie Knope,"You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that great?
Gretel,I didn't want all the slugs gone.
Gretel,I wanted most of them gone!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll put one slug back."
Leslie Knope,"Either way, your problem is solved."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that lady is the worst."
April Ludgate,She didn't even say thank you.
Leslie Knope,"That's not why we do this, April."
Leslie Knope,"We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all."
Leslie Knope,But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,On to the next complaint.
Ron Swanson,"Where the hell are you sending me, Knope?"
Jessica Wicks,"Morning, cutie."
Ben Wyatt,"Morning, Jessica."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Jessica Wicks,"These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington."
Jessica Wicks,He was very impressed with you two.
Jessica Wicks,He sounded rich on the phone.
Jessica Wicks,I think he was calling me from a helicopter.
Ben Wyatt,Could be.
Ben Wyatt,He owns two.
Ben Wyatt,So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.
Ben Wyatt,I hope he's okay.
Ben Wyatt,He sent me an email this morning.
Ben Wyatt,I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, this isn't right."
Andy Dwyer,None of this looks familiar.
Andy Dwyer,Eddie?
Jessica Wicks,"Uh-oh, Spaghettios."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust."
Jessica Wicks,"No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Jessica Wicks,"Come on, Sugarbutt!"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?"
Jessica Wicks,That's you! Come on.
Jessica Wicks,"We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt."
Ben Wyatt,Wildly inappropriate.
Tom Haverford,Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I doubt it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He never gives up on anything, except for my mom."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!"""
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should just throw in the towel.
Tom Haverford,Your dad'll destroy me.
Tom Haverford,I'll be left with nothing.
Tom Haverford,Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.
Tom Haverford,Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"First of all, unbelievable analogy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher."
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I'm basically Babyface."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're basically Babyface!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want to come?
Tom Haverford,No!
Ann Perkins,"I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know?"
Chris Traeger,"You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive."
Chris Traeger,Isn't that wild?
Ann Perkins,It is.
Chris Traeger,A green olive.
Chris Traeger,A little high in sodium.
Chris Traeger,I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.
Ann Perkins,Our baby's not a salad.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right."
Ann Perkins,"It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing."
Ann Perkins,"Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs."
Chris Traeger,It's still just our thing.
Chris Traeger,It'll always be just our thing.
Chris Traeger,That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.
Ann Perkins,"You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl."
Chris Traeger,"I prefer ""Chickpea."""
Ann Perkins,Because it's lower in sodium?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, exactly."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
April Ludgate,Are you leaving?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."
Leslie Knope,"Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, brother."
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you."
April Ludgate,"I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours."
April Ludgate,"So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face."
April Ludgate,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,Please sit.
April Ludgate,"""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
April Ludgate,"""Dear award committee members, where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, people who don't care at all about what they do""or how they do it."""
April Ludgate,"""They let the world wash over them and barely notice anyone else is even there."""
April Ludgate,"""Leslie Knope is not one of these people."""
April Ludgate,"""She cares about everything and everyone in our town."""
April Ludgate,"""I don't know how she does it."""
April Ludgate,"""People come to her with the pettiest, stupidest problems, and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- what happens to them."""
April Ludgate,"""And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, your life gets better every day."""
April Ludgate,"""She spends every waking moment thinking of new ways to make her friends happy."""
April Ludgate,"""There is something wonderful about seeing someone who has found her true purpose on earth."""
April Ludgate,"""For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut or a hot dog-eating champion."""
April Ludgate,"""For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, is making people's lives better."""
April Ludgate,"""That's what I love about her, and that's why she deserves this award."""
April Ludgate,"""Sincerely Satan."""
Leslie Knope,You're getting hugged right now.
April Ludgate,"No, I told you not to."
Leslie Knope,I'm giving you a hug.
April Ludgate,No! I told you not to. Stay away!
April Ludgate,No!
Ron Swanson,All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.
Ron Swanson,"But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption."
Ron Swanson,This is worth the trip.
Ron Swanson,"""Dear Ron, you have now reached the cliffsides overlooking the islands."""
Ron Swanson,"""As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, please read out loud the poem by the great Scotsman Robert Burns."""
Ron Swanson,"""Love, Leslie."""
Ron Swanson,"""Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, with purple blossoms to the spring, and I, a bird to shelter there, when wearied on my little wing, how I would mourn when it was torn by autumn wild and winter rude, but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed."""
Ron Swanson,I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.
Ben Wyatt,Nice to be home.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."
Leslie Knope,"And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts."
Ben Wyatt,"We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's one more thing I want to try."
Ben Wyatt,Mm.
Leslie Knope,I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wear it for me.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"No, not sexy."
Leslie Knope,Failed experiment.
Leslie Knope,Take it off.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just-- okay."
Leslie Knope,Just take it off.
Leslie Knope,No.
