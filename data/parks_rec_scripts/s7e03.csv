Leslie Knope,"So, gentlemen, you have evidence that the Newport land should be preserved."
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra,"You see, I'm a ninth level octopriest in the Church of the Reasonableists."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Extra,The land is sacred in our religion because it's the place where all human souls will be transmuted when Zorp the Lizard God passes through Jupiter's Sphincter.
April Ludgate,Hail Zorp.
Extra,Hail Zorp.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.
Leslie Knope,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance."
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping."
Manrico Della Rossa,"In 1980, there were more than 600 million Indiana Brown Ants in that forest."
Manrico Della Rossa,"Today, there are only 595 million."
Manrico Della Rossa,"At that rate, they'll all be gone by the year 203060."
Leslie Knope,Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?
Leslie Knope,Two hundred thousand years from now?
Manrico Della Rossa,Yes.
Leslie Knope,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.
Herman,I've got a different idea for that land.
Herman,An amusement park with rides and food and sexy cartoon characters.
Herman,I call it Disneyland.
Leslie Knope,How did you get in here?
Herman,Broke a window.
Roscoe,"Hey, guys."
Roscoe,Come on in.
Roscoe,"You guys, I am Roscoe."
Roscoe,I am Vice President of Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.
Roscoe,Feel free in this meeting to break out your vapes and just kick back.
Roscoe,"Now, peep this."
Roscoe,Leslie Knope has been meeting with people to try to sexy up her presentation.
Roscoe,"So, we had this far out brain tornado."
Tom Haverford,Good idea.
Roscoe,"We should get a brity to come kick it with us smalltime and then just be like, ""Hey, chums."""
Roscoe,"""Let's get tight with Gryzz."""
Tom Haverford,We need a celebrity as a minority owner.
Tom Haverford,It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.
Ron Swanson,Is a celebrity necessary?
Ron Swanson,I prefer quality over flash.
Ron Swanson,That's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.
Donna Meagle,Celebrities can help with this kind of thing.
Donna Meagle,The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn if it weren't for Jay Z.
Donna Meagle,And the sales for ChickfilA went through the roof once Elton John bought them.
Roscoe,Exactly.
Roscoe,Gryzzl is an outsider here in Pawnee.
Roscoe,"So, a local celebrity is going to make everyone feel more at ease with us."
Roscoe,And that's why we called on you home court chillers to frack your brainiums.
Tom Haverford,"Since we're locals, they want us to think of ideas--"
Ron Swanson,I got it from context.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I have no interest in consorting with celebrities.
Ron Swanson,"The only celebrities I recognize are furniture maker Garry Knox Bennett, designer of the notorious and Magnus, the five-by-five bull elk I saw near my cabin two years ago."
Ron Swanson,"Took a shot at the bastard, and he stuck his antlers through the door of my meat shed."
Ron Swanson,"One day, Magnus, I will wear you as a jacket."
Andy Dwyer,Have you thought about this?
Andy Dwyer,You could be an airline pilot.
April Ludgate,I don't like heights.
Andy Dwyer,What about a submarine pilot?
April Ludgate,I don't like depths.
April Ludgate,"I don't like anything, okay?"
April Ludgate,You're not gonna be able to find a career for me.
April Ludgate,"So, just give up."
Andy Dwyer,"No way, babe."
Andy Dwyer,We can do this.
Andy Dwyer,Let's play a game.
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
Andy Dwyer,"You say a word, I say a word, we see if it makes a profession."
April Ludgate,Executive.
Andy Dwyer,Trampoline.
April Ludgate,Computer.
Andy Dwyer,Trampoline.
April Ludgate,Trampoline.
Andy Dwyer,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, I need both you and Ron to sign this City Point of Sale document, since the land you're gunning for lies within city limits."
Ben Wyatt,Can we run over to Ron's office and take care of this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs."
Leslie Knope,You know it turns me on.
Leslie Knope,But no.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.
Leslie Knope,"""That's him, officer!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,"""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month."""
Leslie Knope,"""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and a siren for your car."""
Ben Wyatt,Could you please focus?
Ben Wyatt,It will take two minutes.
Ben Wyatt,"And all signatures need to be notarized, and I really don't want to have to schedule two different notary appointments."
Jerry Gergich,"Not to eavesdrop, but I have a crazy story."
Jerry Gergich,"I recently had a bit of a health scare, just a couple weeks in the hospital."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,This story's terrible so far.
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, I became really motivated once I got out to finally live life to the fullest."
Jerry Gergich,"So, I fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams, and I became a Notary Public."
Jerry Gergich,"So, if I go with you, Ron and Leslie can sign the document separately."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben?"
Leslie Knope,It all works out.
Leslie Knope,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell."
Ben Wyatt,How long are you two going to go on like this?
Ben Wyatt,You're acting like a little kid.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,And infinity plus one year.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, bring in the next person."
Tom Haverford,Perd Hapley.
Tom Haverford,Crazy Ira and the Douche.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,"That's nice, but I don't know if you can really consider me a celebrity."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,That's your handwriting.
Tom Haverford,"These are all great options, but I think we need to go after Pawnee's biggest fish."
Tom Haverford,Annabel Porter from Bloosh.
Ron Swanson,That horrifying Lifestyle Newsletter filled with vegan recipes and pointless tchotchkes?
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,That woman is my nightmare.
Donna Meagle,"Um, she's a big deal, Ron."
Donna Meagle,Bloosh has won the Pulitzer Prize for best top ten listicle two years in a row.
Bill Haggerty,"Hi, Leslie."
Bill Haggerty,Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee Historical Society.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you."
Bill Haggerty,"I heard you were looking for information on the Newport land, and I have some very exciting news for you."
Bill Haggerty,It concerns William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.
Leslie Knope,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later."
Leslie Knope,He's an embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,But he's our embarrassing footnote.
Bill Haggerty,"I've recently self published a biography about Harrison entitled ""Barely a President. William Henry Harrison's Thirty Two Days in the White House."""
Bill Haggerty,I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.
April Ludgate,"Um, spoilers much?"
April Ludgate,Now I'll never read that book.
Leslie Knope,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team."
Leslie Knope,"Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Show me this incredible lodge.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"That book sounded so boring, I cried a little."
April Ludgate,"Oh, babe, I'm sorry you had to hear that."
April Ludgate,You're safe now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry to bother you, but I need you to sign this Point of Sale document."
Ben Wyatt,And please sign it in cursive.
Ben Wyatt,It raises a lot of red flags if you don't.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"So, what's Leslie up to?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't think I should discuss that, given that you're in competition."
Ben Wyatt,Need to remain neutral.
Ron Swanson,Fair enough.
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what's Leslie up to?"
Jerry Gergich,She is trying to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation.
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on, man."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you little sneak."
Ron Swanson,"If Leslie is going for a hook, we should, too."
Ron Swanson,Let's get Annabel Bloosh person.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Glad to see you've finally come around after these two minutes of insanity.
Tom Haverford,"Now, will you please consider investing in that toddler cologne I've been bugging you about?"
Tom Haverford,Toddler cologne.
Tom Haverford,"Baby, you smell good."
Bill Haggerty,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map that will show us the way to William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?"""
Bill Haggerty,No.
Bill Haggerty,This is all that's left.
April Ludgate,This place is awesome.
April Ludgate,"Babe, we should sell our dumb house and buy this one."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, literally."
Leslie Knope,There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,How old?
Leslie Knope,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks."
Leslie Knope,I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.
Bill Haggerty,Let's head to the Harrison museum over in Vincennes.
Bill Haggerty,I volunteer there part time.
Andy Dwyer,I found an artifact!
Andy Dwyer,Historical artifact!
Andy Dwyer,William Henry Harrison's wig.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Put that down.
April Ludgate,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,You've got to be kidding me.
Jerry Gergich,"No, I'm sorry, Ben, but there's a page missing from the document."
Jerry Gergich,"So, then, the signatures are invalid."
Ben Wyatt,Can't we just say it was there?
Jerry Gergich,You're asking a notary to lie.
Jerry Gergich,"I signed an oath, Ben."
Jerry Gergich,And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.
April Ludgate,William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.
April Ludgate,They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.
April Ludgate,The If He'd Worn A Coat room explores how great America would have been if Harrison had worn a coat at his inauguration and not died.
April Ludgate,This room is called Other Things That Were Famous For One Month.
April Ludgate,"Oh, and side note, admission to this museum costs 14 dollars."
April Ludgate,"And while you're here, why not visit the Other Famous Harrisons exhibit?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, this is so great."
Leslie Knope,"During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this ten foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America."
Leslie Knope,"And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting."
Leslie Knope,People would come from miles just to see it.
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Was there something inside the stupid ball?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Like a giant hamster?
Leslie Knope,"This is what we have to work with, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find."
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people!"
Leslie Knope,Quantity!
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Tom Haverford,This is exactly what I imagined heaven looks like.
Tom Haverford,Right down to the unisex linen tunics.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel, ma cherie."
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Annabel Porter,I'm sorry I'm late for our coven.
Annabel Porter,I was polishing my oyster forks with a cage-free olive oil rub.
Ron Swanson,"Apology accepted, and then I have no reaction to anything else you said."
Donna Meagle,"I can't help but ask, what's in right now?"
Annabel Porter,"Well, this season, I'm intrigued by asymmetrical overalls, angora toothbrushes, and locally sourced Italian flip-flops."
Annabel Porter,"Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages."
Annabel Porter,"So, you've had soy milk and almond milk."
Annabel Porter,"Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk."
Annabel Porter,It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.
Ron Swanson,That's [bleep] milk.
Tom Haverford,No.
Annabel Porter,No.
Tom Haverford,Milk costs 3 dollars a gallon.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel's authentic, hand-strained teat-to-table Beef Milk?"
Tom Haverford,That costs 60 dollars a gallon.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,And there's a wait list.
Donna Meagle,This woman knows business.
Annabel Porter,And I would be extremely jazzed to be part of the Gryzzl bid.
Annabel Porter,Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Annabel Porter,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's try this again."
Ben Wyatt,All pages accounted for.
Ben Wyatt,Just sign right here.
Ron Swanson,How is Leslie doing with her quest?
Ben Wyatt,"Again, I don't want to talk about her plan with you, nor yours with her."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure you understand.
Ron Swanson,Absolutely.
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what is Leslie up to?"
Jerry Gergich,Getting ready for a big press conference.
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on!"
Ron Swanson,A press conference?
Ron Swanson,"So, she's found something to strengthen her bid."
Ron Swanson,Ms. Porter.
Annabel Porter,Mmm?
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss any further.
Ron Swanson,You will be the face of the Gryzzl bid.
Annabel Porter,Smashing.
Annabel Porter,"Well, this calls for a celebratory dram of aged grappa."
Annabel Porter,"So, I just sign here?"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Annabel Porter,Great.
Annabel Porter,There you go.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's invalid now."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
April Ludgate,"Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty."
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.
April Ludgate,It's weird and sad and unnecessary.
April Ludgate,"Is there, like, a museum curator position I could apply for?"
Bill Haggerty,"Sorry, everyone here is a volunteer."
Bill Haggerty,"Though you do get a yearly stipend of 50,000 Harrison Bucks."
Bill Haggerty,Accepted only at that vending machine.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,That's a bummer.
Andy Dwyer,"But, hey, babe, listen."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you could start your own museum.
April Ludgate,About what?
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, but I am not like you."
April Ludgate,You love everything.
April Ludgate,"The only things I like are dogs, sleeping late, and weird birthmarks."
April Ludgate,You can't make museums about those.
April Ludgate,This is another dead end.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, let's keep it going."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab the reading glasses.
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab that walking stick.
Leslie Knope,Grab everything you can.
Leslie Knope,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God you're still here."
Ben Wyatt,I cannot believe the weird notary hell I've been trapped in.
Jerry Gergich,It's been more like heaven for me.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, what a day."
Leslie Knope,What's Ron up to?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I am not--"
Leslie Knope,"No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,They got Annabel Porter to be the celebrity face of their group.
Leslie Knope,That little rat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Two can play this game.
Leslie Knope,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face."
Leslie Knope,Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?
Bill Haggerty,One.
Bill Haggerty,A distant nephew named Zach Harrison.
Leslie Knope,This is our guy!
Leslie Knope,American royalty!
Leslie Knope,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!
Andy Dwyer,Zach Harrison?
Andy Dwyer,I went to camp with this guy.
Andy Dwyer,No one would ride in the boat with him because he had terrible BO.
Andy Dwyer,"Then, he went with Janine, our counselor, and he fell asleep and got a boner."
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's American royalty."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,And we need him for the press conference.
Leslie Knope,And we need all of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I do--"
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people."
Jerry Gergich,Notary publics can trace our origin all the way back to ancient Rome.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Jerry Gergich,Calvin Coolidge was a notary.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad and so was Calvin Coolidge's paternal grandfather.
Ben Wyatt,Uh-huh.
Jerry Gergich,It's 2.5 pounds of pressure is what you need to get the perfect stamp.
Jerry Gergich,"This monthly-- Well, it's a notary email newsletter."
Jerry Gergich,"And, oh, my gosh."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Jerry Gergich,"Ben, it's fun."
Jerry Gergich,It's just fun.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I have been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,I made a list of everything that I know you like.
Andy Dwyer,"Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc."
Andy Dwyer,"And then, I lost the list."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I had to make a new list."
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg."
Andy Dwyer,And that's when my leg fell asleep.
April Ludgate,"Okay, could you just skip ahead a little?"
Andy Dwyer,What do all the things on that list have in common?
Andy Dwyer,They're one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,You like dealing with people or dogs one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,"See, we don't make a list of the things that you love."
Andy Dwyer,We make a list of the reasons why you love them.
Andy Dwyer,And then we find something that fits that list.
April Ludgate,You're the best husband ever.
Zach Harrison,"Hi, Zach Harrison."
Zach Harrison,You wanted to meet with me about a press conference?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello, Zach."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am Leslie."
Leslie Knope,It is an honor to have you here.
Leslie Knope,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.
Zach Harrison,"Look, I really don't think you should make a big deal out of this."
Zach Harrison,I just happen to be a descendant of a guy.
Zach Harrison,"You could be the descendant of George Washington, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,Do you?
Zach Harrison,"No, that was just a hypothetical--"
Leslie Knope,Could that be possible?
Leslie Knope,"Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's something to chew on.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,I need this to be very impressive.
Leslie Knope,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended."
Leslie Knope,Just go in there.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Just walk, walk, walk there."
Leslie Knope,Quiet now.
Leslie Knope,Walk in.
Andy Dwyer,Zach!
Andy Dwyer,Camp Wamapoke.
Andy Dwyer,You got a boner.
Andy Dwyer,We'll catch up.
Andy Dwyer,What a dick.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing here?"
Ron Swanson,"Setting up for our press conference, which will take place immediately after yours."
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,You can't do that.
April Ludgate,Do you want me to bite him?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ignore them.
Leslie Knope,We start in 10 minutes.
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, you didn't say anything about ambushing Leslie's press conference."
Ron Swanson,I didn't think it was relevant.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, man."
Tom Haverford,This isn't cool.
Ron Swanson,This is a competition.
Ron Swanson,We need to win it.
Ron Swanson,Please do your jobs.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage."
Leslie Knope,And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.
Leslie Knope,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?
Leslie Knope,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.
Leslie Knope,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed."
Leslie Knope,The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe me?
Leslie Knope,Let's ask him.
Leslie Knope,"In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary."
Zach Harrison,"Hi, I'm Zach."
Zach Harrison,Harrison.
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Zach Harrison,"Zachary, what is it like being a descendant of William Henry Harrison?"
Zach Harrison,Uh... Harrison's a pretty common last name.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit."
Leslie Knope,"Now, travel back in time with me to 1840, when William Henry Harrison, ""Old Tippecanoe,"" runs for President."
Leslie Knope,"And his campaign rolls this giant tin and paper ball from town to town, while Americans everywhere sing along."
Leslie Knope,"Hit it, gang!"
Extras,"What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion Our country through It is the ball a-rolling on"
Leslie Knope,They're talking about this ball.
Extras,"For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too Tippecanoe and Tyler, too And with him, we'll beat Little Van"
Leslie Knope,Martin Van Buren.
Leslie Knope,That's who.
Extras,Van is a used up man And with them we'll beat Little Van
Tom Haverford,"Wow, that was cool, said some boring idiot from 200 years ago."
Tom Haverford,Who cares about some dumb grandpa and his tin ball? That's the past.
Tom Haverford,Gryzzl is the future.
Tom Haverford,The Newport land will become the Midwest headquarters of America's most dynamic technology company.
Donna Meagle,"Here to introduce our vision is Annabel Porter from Bloosh, and the sexy ladies known in Pawnee as the Somebody's Daughter dancers."
Annabel Porter,Fresh.
Annabel Porter,Innovative.
Annabel Porter,Placemaking.
Annabel Porter,Disposable duvets.
Annabel Porter,Growth hacking.
Annabel Porter,Super Moon.
Annabel Porter,Gryzzl.
Annabel Porter,"Now, come with me, as we binge-watch the future."
Leslie Knope,That was sickening.
Leslie Knope,"All flash, and no substance."
Ron Swanson,It was exactly as substantive as your presentation.
Leslie Knope,"No, it was not! We had way more quantity than you."
Ben Wyatt,Please.
Ben Wyatt,Please.
Ben Wyatt,"For the love of all that is holy, both of you, please, sign this form."
Ben Wyatt,Not that it matters.
Ben Wyatt,I'm definitely going to wake up tomorrow morning with the same forms for you to sign.
Ben Wyatt,Because I've died somehow and now I'm a ghost living in purgatory until I complete my unfinished business.
Leslie Knope,I'm not signing anything he's signing.
Ben Wyatt,Did you just hear what I said?
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course you didn't."
Ben Wyatt,Because I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope,You know what? I can't stand you.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand your stupid mustache and your stupid shirt and your stupid name.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,That's not even a word.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have had just about enough of your stubborn behavior."
Ron Swanson,"Ever since the Morningstar incident, you have been completely unreasonable."
Leslie Knope,You are the unreasonable one!
Leslie Knope,You've been unreasonable way before Morningstar!
Leslie Knope,"You're the most unreasonable, stubborn person I have ever met, and I'm never gonna change my mind on that, no matter what anybody says!"
Ron Swanson,You're not that good at scrapbooking.
Leslie Knope,What?
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Would you just sign right here? And I will need your thumbprints.
Tom Haverford,"Man, those two really hate each other."
Tom Haverford,"That feud is, like, Biggie Tupac level."
Tom Haverford,Maybe even Morgan Freeman Shailene Woodley level.
Donna Meagle,Naw.
Donna Meagle,"It's bad, but it's not that bad."
Ben Wyatt,This is like when the triplets fight except I can't just give Leslie and Ron stuffed animals to make them calm down.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that might work."
Ben Wyatt,Have we tried that?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, they've always butted heads, but I really I don't think they hate each other."
Jerry Gergich,I just think they're very different people and they've just drifted apart once they stopped working in the same office.
Ben Wyatt,You okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office."
Leslie Knope,"So, that calmed me down a little."
Ben Wyatt,I know you're furious at him.
Ben Wyatt,"But please, come to a neutral site and sit with Ron for 30 seconds so I can get this dumb document signed."
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"I'll let you rename the triplets Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,But I get to sign first.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's just get this over with."
Ben Wyatt,Let me get that for you.
Ben Wyatt,Got them!
Leslie Knope,What? What's going on? What's going on?
Ron Swanson,Let us out immediately.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,You guys are being ridiculous.
Ben Wyatt,"This has gone too far, and you are not leaving this office until you've made peace."
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,No!
