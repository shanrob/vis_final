Ann Perkins,Morning.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, can you approve this new design for the campaign poster?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rulebreaking moth."
Leslie Knope,You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"It's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question."
Leslie Knope,"When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign related inside a government building."
Andy Dwyer,"Boss, I need your Herbie Hancock on this."
Leslie Knope,Outside.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
Ben Wyatt,So Perd Hapley wants to do Thursday now.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
April Ludgate,Did you finish the maintenance report?
Leslie Knope,"I did not finish it, but I will finish it."
Leslie Knope,"So wait, what was your question again?"
Ben Wyatt,The slogan?
April Ludgate,"Okay, can I just come out there, so we can talk about everything?"
Leslie Knope,"No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just think of it like a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign is outside.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign's outside.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, you know what would make it more fun?"
Leslie Knope,What?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, this."
Leslie Knope,April.
Ron Swanson,"It's time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,You have to take a leave of absence from the department.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, that is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,We've talked about this.
Leslie Knope,"No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department."
Leslie Knope,City council is a parttime job.
Ron Swanson,But campaigning is a fulltime job.
Ron Swanson,Right now you're working and 50 hours a week on the campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have time to spare."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also volunteering at ""Wheels For Meals On Wheels."
Leslie Knope,""" We repair vans for ""Meals On Wheels."""
Ron Swanson,You're a month behind on everything.
Ron Swanson,You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.
Ron Swanson,"You do it every week, and you forgot."
Ron Swanson,Things are falling through the cracks.
Ron Swanson,I'm pretty sure you've worn that sweater four days in a row.
Leslie Knope,Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't, there's an old lollipop that's been stuck to the back since Tuesday."
Leslie Knope,"That's the style now, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""lollipopping."""
Leslie Knope,All the kids are doing it.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to take a sabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again."
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ann."
Tom Haverford,You can't open this gift.
Tom Haverford,It's for the most beautiful girl in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, hold up, hold up."
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, hold up, wait."
Tom Haverford,That's you.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, and look, I got one too."
Tom Haverford,Matching His and Hers.
Ann Perkins,"So I'm ""Tommy's girl,"" and you're just ""Tom""?"
Ann Perkins,"Why not ""Ann's man""?"
Tom Haverford,"Nobody owns me, cupcake, not even you."
Ann Perkins,"You can either burn these hats in a fire, or you can use a blowtorch."
Tom Haverford,How about this option?
Tom Haverford,We put the hats on
Ann Perkins,Don't say it.
Tom Haverford,We take everything else off.
Tom Haverford,These Kangol hats are exactly like the one Samuel L.
Tom Haverford,Jackson wore to the Latin Grammys.
Tom Haverford,How could she not like them?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,It's like somehow everything I do with her is wrong.
April Ludgate,"Dude, seriously, leave me out of this."
April Ludgate,"I kind of set up Tom and Ann, and now they won't stop asking me for advice, which is a really bad move on their part, because I really don't care what happens to them Or anyone."
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, bud."
Andy Dwyer,I missed you.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer,I hope he wasn't a handful.
Chris Traeger,Not in the slightest.
Chris Traeger,"As the Germans would say, ""er ist ein wunder hund."
Chris Traeger,""" He is a wonder dog."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Chris Traeger,"The dog training course I took was conducted entirely in German, and so now I'm fluent in German Words relating to dogs."
Chris Traeger,"April and Andy went away for the night, and I looked after Champion here."
Chris Traeger,He's a mutt.
Chris Traeger,"Half amazing, half terrific."
Chris Traeger,Ich bin ein three legged dog.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I took him to PetSmart."
Chris Traeger,"I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise."
Chris Traeger,He's healthier than ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did his leg grow back?"
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,That's okay.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if I may"
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Dogs tend to take on the personalities of their owners
Andy Dwyer,Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,"So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too."
Andy Dwyer,Who wouldn't?
Andy Dwyer,"That sounds like an amazing day, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, thanks."
Chris Traeger,"Bye, Champion."
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, take that shirt off."
Tom Haverford,You look ridiculous.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it is okay."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember."
Jerry Gergich,"My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years."
Jerry Gergich,But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
Jerry Gergich,"We go, we split a huge piece of cotton candy cheesecake from Cakey J's Cheesecake Facility."
Jerry Gergich,"And then, well, we hold hands for a while."
Jerry Gergich,We listen to some Anita Baker.
Jerry Gergich,"She meets up with some friends, and I turn in early."
Leslie Knope,This is unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Birthdays are important.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
Ron Swanson,I guess it just slipped through the cracks.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I guess it did."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing at the reservoir.
Jerry Gergich,Now?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung."
Jerry Gergich,Can I at least grab the gloves?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what are you doing standing here?"
Leslie Knope,Our water has poop in it.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
Andy Dwyer,He's only 64?
Leslie Knope,64 divided by 4 is 16.
Andy Dwyer,64
Leslie Knope,So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be very special.
April Ludgate,"The usual, cake and pop?"
Leslie Knope,"No, April, the unusual."
April Ludgate,Fish and pop.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Cake and fish.
Leslie Knope,"No, no fish."
Leslie Knope,Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
Leslie Knope,"And four years from now, who knows?"
Leslie Knope,He might be retired Or dead.
Tom Haverford,Let's start a pool.
Tom Haverford,Who wants retied?
Tom Haverford,Who wants dead?
April Ludgate,Dead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,I got one dead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,You need to take that?
Leslie Knope,"Mm, no."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can we use your lake house?"
Donna Meagle,How did you know about that?
Donna Meagle,"My family has a lake house up in the foothills, but we keep it quiet."
Donna Meagle,We're not big on hospitality.
Donna Meagle,The Meagles are a cold people.
Leslie Knope,Can we use your house?
Donna Meagle,I suppose.
Donna Meagle,Bring your own towels.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, Donna."
Ann Perkins,This place is beautiful.
Donna Meagle,"Yes, it is, and it will stay that way."
Donna Meagle,These are the house rules.
Donna Meagle,No dirty shoes in the house.
Donna Meagle,Upstairs is Meagle space only.
Donna Meagle,"And if you listen closely, that is the bubbling of the hot tub."
Donna Meagle,You do not have access to it.
Donna Meagle,"If you follow these rules, we won't have a problem."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Is that Ginuwine?
Donna Meagle,Mmhmm.
Tom Haverford,Why do you have Ginuwine's platinum record on your wall?
Tom Haverford,Why do you have a photo of you with Ginuwine at some place?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, have I never talked about this before?"
Donna Meagle,Ginuwine's my cousin.
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,The Ginuwine is your cousin?
Tom Haverford,How do I not know this?
Ann Perkins,Who's Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
Tom Haverford,He's Ginuwine.
Ann Perkins,Saying his name over and over again is not going to help me.
Tom Haverford,He's an R&B singer.
Tom Haverford,"Pony, Differences."
Tom Haverford,Do you really not know who Ginuwine is?
Ann Perkins,I know that he's Donna's cousin.
Tom Haverford,"When I'm dating someone, I have a list called my ""oh no nos."
Tom Haverford,""" A woman commits an ""oh no no,"" it can end the relationship."
Tom Haverford,"Not loving '90s R&B music is number three on the ""oh no nos"" list."
Tom Haverford,Girl doesn't even know who Ginuwine is.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, boy."
Chris Traeger,How was the ride?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, you want me to show you something?"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Platz.
Chris Traeger,Steh Auf.
Chris Traeger,"See, it's pretty cool, huh?"
Chris Traeger,Would you like me to teach you?
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, whatever."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, anybody can do that."
Andy Dwyer,Toxic.
Andy Dwyer,Merkel.
Andy Dwyer,Merkel.
Andy Dwyer,"What is ""Merkel""?"
Chris Traeger,She's the Chancellor of Germany.
Leslie Knope,Not only more jobs but better jobs.
Leslie Knope,I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Leslie Knope,"Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it."
Leslie Knope,"Crow for dinner tonight, Mr."
Leslie Knope,Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are locked and loaded."
Leslie Knope,Music is ready.
Leslie Knope,Slideshow is prepped.
Leslie Knope,"April, when does Jerry arrive?"
April Ludgate,How would I know?
Leslie Knope,Who was supposed to invite Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"It's his surp Crap, it was me."
Leslie Knope,I forgot to invite Jerry.
Ron Swanson,You need to take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry to his own birthday party?
Ron Swanson,It did seem like an oversight.
Leslie Knope,"I have a prediction, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, ""sabbatical, schmabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Leslie can do it all.
Leslie Knope,"She's the best, and I'm stupid."
Ron Swanson,""" That does sound like me."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Here's a fun game.
Tom Haverford,Let's talk minimum acceptable thread count for sheets.
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, that does sound fun."
Tom Haverford,Stop me when I hit it.
Tom Haverford,1000
Tom Haverford,800
Tom Haverford,700
Tom Haverford,600
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I'm at 600."
Tom Haverford,Are you really not stopping me?
Ann Perkins,I have those cotton tshirt sheets.
Tom Haverford,Huh?
Tom Haverford,It's always the most beautiful ladies who hurt you the worst.
Tom Haverford,She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie?
Tom Haverford,"That's a huge ""oh no no."""
Tom Haverford,"She also ""doesn't care"" about Bluray?"
April Ludgate,She's a monster.
Tom Haverford,"April, this is serious."
Tom Haverford,I might have to break up with Ann.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, then break up with her."
Tom Haverford,But she's my dream girl.
April Ludgate,Then don't break up with her.
Tom Haverford,Except she hates everything I like.
Tom Haverford,I own more pairs of Uggs than she does.
April Ludgate,"I was getting kind of sick of listening to Tom and Ann talk about their relationship, but then I remembered that alcohol existed."
April Ludgate,"Thank you, alcohol."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell could he be?
Ron Swanson,Maybe someone else had a surprise party and actually remembered to invite him.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why did you call us in here?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, because I thought you were Gayle."
Jerry Gergich,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, Leslie, what are we doing in Jerry's bathroom?"
Leslie Knope,"There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub."
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Geez I gotta get dressed."
Leslie Knope,"No, there's no time."
Ron Swanson,"There's time, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Get dressed.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, what is the big emergency?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, did we lose more seniors in the woods?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's a sinkhole, right?"
Leslie Knope,Crap on a catapult.
Leslie Knope,They screwed up my campaign signs.
Leslie Knope,Now I gotta deal with this.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, but what about the sinkhole?"
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie will deal with this and the sinkhole."
Ron Swanson,"Right, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I will, Ron."
Leslie Knope,And I shall do it with aplomb.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with Tom?
April Ludgate,Don't know.
Ann Perkins,It's like I'm dating some idiotic game show host.
Ann Perkins,He is driving me crazy with these stupid questions.
April Ludgate,"Well, soon it won't matter."
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,What did he tell you?
April Ludgate,Nothing.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is he gonna break up with me?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I'm
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"That's not how this ends, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I break up with him.
April Ludgate,I think I will celebrate with a drink.
Andy Dwyer,Quit pulling.
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, I'll let you off the leash."
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"What the [Bleep], dude?"
Andy Dwyer,Where did you come from?
Chris Traeger,I think that Champion should stay on his leash.
Chris Traeger,There's unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.
Andy Dwyer,"No, leashes are just for dogs that bite people."
Chris Traeger,That's not true.
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, Champion's my dog, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,He's not going anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes you just have to let a dog be a dog.
Andy Dwyer,He'll be all right.
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,He'll come back.
Leslie Knope,"So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane."
Extra,See right here on the order form?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I can read the sign.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Extra,""".com/imagescmyk/"" well, but this isn't what ""page/carnpaignlqty100123"""
Leslie Knope,You don't need to read the whole thing.
Extra,"""9u/09230023"""
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Extra,"""099twposter"""
Leslie Knope,it does say that.
Extra,""".jpeg."
Leslie Knope,""" Jpeg."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Walter, it does say that."
Leslie Knope,"You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image."
Leslie Knope,This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Extra,Whatever's on the order form I print.
Extra,"In this case, it was a long string of letters and numbers."
Leslie Knope,Can I just show you something here?
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Extra,That's highly against protocol.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here, look."
Extra,That's a good sign.
Extra,You should've used that.
Ann Perkins,You told April you were breaking up with me?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, we consistently disagree on ""who wore it best."""
Tom Haverford,You still use an iPad one.
Tom Haverford,You read books all the time.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, how about my ""oh no nos"" for you?"
Ann Perkins,"You make me see terrible movies, and then you talk through them."
Ann Perkins,"""You put 20 inch rims on your volkswagen golf, and you insist on being introduced as ""the brown Gosling."
Tom Haverford,""" Everything you just said makes me like me more."
April Ludgate,"I can't take it any more, okay?"
April Ludgate,I'm breaking you up.
April Ludgate,You guys are done.
Ann Perkins,Fine with me.
Tom Haverford,"Fine, fine."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, April."
April Ludgate,I'm drunk.
April Ludgate,"You made me drunk, you made me drunk, and you"
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,Give it a rest.
April Ludgate,I need it.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
April Ludgate,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Let's get you to bed.
April Ludgate,"You know, why are you guys even fighting anyway?"
April Ludgate,It's so stupid.
April Ludgate,"""I hate Ann because of this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,"""And I hate Tom for this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,Who cares?
Ron Swanson,You want some help?
Leslie Knope,"No, I got it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we did everything, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We got new signs.
Leslie Knope,We put them in people's yards.
Leslie Knope,We got Jerry for the surprise sinkhole emergency.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station."
Leslie Knope,"We got more gas, and now we're all good."
Ron Swanson,"Yep, you truly are attempting to do it all."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,We didn't get to the drug store for my liver medication.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, wait a second."
Jerry Gergich,This is clearly not a sinkhole problem.
Jerry Gergich,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear."
Leslie Knope,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what the [Bleep]?"
Ben Wyatt,Surprise.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell is everybody?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it got so late."
Ben Wyatt,We just weren't sure you were still coming.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's either in bed or out looking for Champion.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Champion ran away.
Leslie Knope,Wake everybody up.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"No, I am not gonna let this fall apart."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
Ben Wyatt,That's the spirit.
Andy Dwyer,Champion.
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,"Champion, come here, boy."
Chris Traeger,"I have an organic, gluten free soy bone for you."
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, there's something I have to tell you."
Andy Dwyer,I ate one of your soy bones.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was really good."
Andy Dwyer,"I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just it looked so yummy."
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner."
Andy Dwyer,"And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound."
Chris Traeger,You gave him a home.
Chris Traeger,That's amazing.
Chris Traeger,And he's your dog.
Chris Traeger,"If you just call out his name, he will come to you."
Andy Dwyer,"What no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work."
Chris Traeger,I think he likes your music.
Chris Traeger,Why don't you sing to him?
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,I don't have my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,I usually
Chris Traeger,Come on
Andy Dwyer,"I feel naked without it, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, you're lost and soon you'll be found I rescued you from the pound, something somethingoh manon the ground get on out of here Champion!"
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, buddy, you came back."
Andy Dwyer,You came back to my voice.
Chris Traeger,Dog whistle.
Ann Perkins,"April, wake up."
Tom Haverford,Jerry's here.
Ann Perkins,April.
Tom Haverford,April.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
April Ludgate,Why is your arm around her? I broke you up.
Tom Haverford,"Well, we got back together again 'cause of what you said."
April Ludgate,What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, when we were carrying you to bed, you correctly pointed out that we were arguing about stuff that was stupid, and so we talked it out."
Ann Perkins,"And I apologized, and he apologized."
Ann Perkins,And now everything's great.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm drunk.
April Ludgate,"Don't listen to me, no."
Ann Perkins,See you out there.
April Ludgate,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, thanks, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"This is really, this is really great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story."
Leslie Knope,A positive one.
Leslie Knope,Who's first?
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, today is your birthday, but it's about much more than that."
Tom Haverford,It's also about Ann and I getting back together and being the hottest couple in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,I'd also like to announce our official relationship mash-up name.
Tom Haverford,"It's ""Tan."""
Tom Haverford,To Tan.
Ann Perkins,I would like to announce that the name Tan is officially over.
Ann Perkins,To the end of Tan.
Tom Haverford,Haverkins it is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna?"
Donna Meagle,"I would like to address the fact that rule number seven says, ""no pets,"" and yet there is a three legged animal in my living room."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Jerry's work is often adequate.
Chris Traeger,I'll go.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry has a wife and three beautiful daughters, a full life, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger,"April and Andy have Champion, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger,I have a stepbrother who lives in London and 2.8% body fat.
Jerry Gergich,Guys guys What do I do?
Tom Haverford,"I mean, she's asleep."
Tom Haverford,You probably should just sit there and not move.
Ben Wyatt,She's really tired.
Ben Wyatt,Just a few hours.
Jerry Gergich,Few hours?
Ron Swanson,Is this all the eggs we have?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,What are you making?
Ron Swanson,Eggs.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Surprise! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"What happened? Well, you slept with Jerry last night."
Leslie Knope,"No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party."
Leslie Knope,Morning surprise parties are always the best.
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Ron Swanson,I made some coffee.
Ron Swanson,Let's go for a walk.
Ron Swanson,I now officially insist that you take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,Let me finish.
Ron Swanson,"I used to work in a sheet metal factory, but then a job came along at the tannery."
Ron Swanson,"The hours were better, and I would get paid."
Ron Swanson,"Also I'd have the chance to work with leather both before and after it was on the cow, which had always been a dream of mine."
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want to give up my sheet metal job, so I tried to do both jobs and finish middle school."
Leslie Knope,How old were you?
Ron Swanson,11
Ron Swanson,"The point is, I was so tired, I tried to puncture an eight-gauge aluminum foil with a leather awl."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ron Swanson,I learned a lesson.
Ron Swanson,Never halfass two things.
Ron Swanson,Wholeass one thing.
Ron Swanson,So if you want to win that seat
Leslie Knope,Which I do.
Ron Swanson,Then commit yourself 100%.
Ron Swanson,Take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Ron Swanson,Deal.
Leslie Knope,15
Ron Swanson,10
Leslie Knope,Deal.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, I can't believe I got them back together."
April Ludgate,Now they're always gonna want to come talk to me about stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Eh, that's a good thing, babe."
Andy Dwyer,They want to talk to you because you're important to them.
April Ludgate,"Yes, but I hate them."
Andy Dwyer,"I know you do, sweetheart."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, uh, by the way, I think that Chris is lonely, so I told him he could borrow Champion whenever."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, he's kissing me."
Andy Dwyer,Aww.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,But we all pitched in.
Leslie Knope,And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Jerry Gergich,Muncie?
Leslie Knope,"Amazingly, yes."
Leslie Knope,"Muncie, Indiana."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, guys."
Andy Dwyer,It was really expensive.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, campaign."
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,"If the Bread and Breakfast, you sleep there and you get breakfast."
Leslie Knope,This is Leslie.
