Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Greg Pikitis,"You're the Parks lady, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,I'm the Parks lady.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And I'm here to tell you that this year it ends.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, this kid makes me crazy."
Leslie Knope,"We got a history, Greg and I."
Leslie Knope,He absolutely terrorizes the Parks system.
Leslie Knope,Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,"And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it."
Leslie Knope,"He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid."
Leslie Knope,"I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it."
Greg Pikitis,I don't know what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I think you do."
Leslie Knope,"It ends today, Pikitis."
Leslie Knope,It ends.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Greg Pikitis,"Thanks for stopping by, Leslie."
Greg Pikitis,You look great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Ends today.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Parks Department."
April Ludgate,"Yay, Ann's here."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, just to remind you, tonight, 7 o' clock, my house, in costume. Everybody in?"
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Yup.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Halloween is my favorite holiday, it's just the best."
Ann Perkins,And I don't have to work.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, slutty teenage girls dressed as sexy kittens, pump your own stomachs this year."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, one more thing, the people in this room now are the people I invited, plus Leslie and Donna, so, don't tell anybody."
April Ludgate,"Who's not invited, then?"
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"What's going on, cupcake?"
Tom Haverford,Excited about the party tonight.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you're coming?"
Ann Perkins,I was just about to tell you.
Tom Haverford,Jerry already told me.
Tom Haverford,Can't wait to see how tiny your costume is.
Tom Haverford,What time does it start?
Ann Perkins,7:00
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
Ann Perkins,That looks like something you would find on the wall of a serial killer.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, that's a compliment."
Leslie Knope,Shows dedication.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"What's the big deal, anyway?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, a kid TPs some statue."
Leslie Knope,And all the trees and all the benches.
Leslie Knope,"It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you destroy him early, please come by."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Extra,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,What the... Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Relax.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, William Percy."
Leslie Knope,One of Pawnee's greatest mayors.
Leslie Knope,And a true hero.
Leslie Knope,"During the Pawnee Bread Factory fire of 1922, he ran back into a burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel."
Dave Sanderson,"Didn't, like, 30 people die in that fire?"
Leslie Knope,He wasn't Superman.
Andy Dwyer,He looks like Ron Swanson.
Andy Dwyer,Is that who this is based on?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's based on William Percy.
Leslie Knope,Were you listening to what I just said?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Good news.
Leslie Knope,You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.
Leslie Knope,8 dollars an hour.
Leslie Knope,Commit this to memory.
Leslie Knope,"You see him, you stop him."
Leslie Knope,Knock his head off if you have to.
Dave Sanderson,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,But I give you permission to use excessive force.
Dave Sanderson,Don't use excessive force.
Leslie Knope,Don't go overboard.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,By any means necessary.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean?
Andy Dwyer,A week ago I had nothing.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have a part-time job."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna make 32 bucks tonight.
Andy Dwyer,I owe Leslie everything I have.
Andy Dwyer,"Which, after tonight, will be 39 bucks."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ron Swanson,Am I early?
Ann Perkins,"Nope, you are right on time."
Ron Swanson,I like your costume.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,Raggedy Ann.
Ann Perkins,It was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm a pirate.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Dr. Harris,Ann.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Um, this is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,I know him from that thing that I'm doing.
Ann Perkins,This is Dr. Harris.
Ron Swanson,You're a doctor.
Dr. Harris,Yup.
Ron Swanson,I meant your costume.
Dr. Harris,I got it.
Ann Perkins,"Worlds colliding, always awkward."
Leslie Knope,"8:22 p.m, suspect still with friends in parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance."
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, confirmed."
Dave Sanderson,"Normally, I hate working on Halloween, but it's nice hanging out with Leslie."
Dave Sanderson,"You know, she's focused, she's committed, and she made out with me in my cop car, which is pretty neat."
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have said that.
Dave Sanderson,That's clear to me now.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hi."
Ann Perkins,It's totally okay that you didn't wear a costume.
Derek,I did.
Derek,I'm a straight person.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
Derek,See?
Ann Perkins,Sorry it's a little bit lame right now.
Ann Perkins,But we'll get it going.
April Ludgate,I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.
April Ludgate,Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?
April Ludgate,"Last year, I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons."
April Ludgate,It was amazing.
Nurse,"So, you're the Mark that Ann is dating."
Mark Brendanawicz,I suppose that I am.
Nurse,We're very protective of Ann.
Nurse,We look out for her.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you kind of dropped the ball with Andy then, didn't you?"
Nurse,Aw!
Nurse,Andy.
Nurse,I loved Andy.
Nurse,"Ah, such a sweetheart."
Nurse,Is Andy coming tonight?
Nurse,You should get back with Andy.
Ann Perkins,Who needs a drink?
Ann Perkins,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner."
Dave Sanderson,Turdish?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Like a turd.
Leslie Knope,Like a little turd.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, listen, your scare tactics clearly worked."
Dave Sanderson,You got Andy guarding the statue.
Dave Sanderson,Why don't we go to Ann's party?
Dave Sanderson,Have a little fun.
Dave Sanderson,Oh.
Dave Sanderson,Uh... We wanted to cover that block anyway.
Dave Sanderson,"Wanted a police presence on it, so, this is within the bound, confines ofâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Sure, let's go."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.
Dave Sanderson,Got it.
Leslie Knope,Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?
Dave Sanderson,"No, babe."
Dave Sanderson,Don't touch that.
Leslie Knope,Leaving location.
Leslie Knope,Look at stupid suspect.
Leslie Knope,I hate suspect.
Leslie Knope,Where are my keys?
Dave Sanderson,Looks like it's open.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Dave Sanderson,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Dave Sanderson,We've been tailing that kid for a couple of hours.
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, it must have been somebody else."
Leslie Knope,It was Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,Believe me now?
Dave Sanderson,That doesn't mean anything to me.
Leslie Knope,This is a peach pit.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.
Dave Sanderson,Mmmhmm?
Leslie Knope,This is his ace of spades.
Leslie Knope,This is his calling card.
Leslie Knope,This is what he leaves all his victims.
Leslie Knope,And it's still warm.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go and arrest him."
Leslie Knope,And send this to the lab.
Dave Sanderson,We don't have a lab.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, April."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you're underage."
April Ludgate,You're not.
Dr. Harris,Hey.
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Dr. Harris,This isn't that fun.
Ann Perkins,Didn't need to tell me that.
Dr. Harris,I'm gonna take this home.
Dr. Harris,"Nobody was drinking it, so I'm gonna take it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Dr. Harris,"Gonna take this, too."
Dr. Harris,Been meaning to read it.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, this isn't strictly legal."
Dave Sanderson,"We can talk to him for maybe an hour, and then I gotta let him go."
Leslie Knope,You talk to him first.
Leslie Knope,You have a scary face.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"No, in a good way."
Leslie Knope,Scary cute.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Go talk to him.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Greg Pikitis,"I didn't do this, man."
Greg Pikitis,I promise.
Dave Sanderson,"Now, son, I'm a police officer."
Dave Sanderson,Okay?
Dave Sanderson,You shouldn't lie to me.
Greg Pikitis,I'm not.
Greg Pikitis,I've never been here before.
Greg Pikitis,And why would I do this?
Dave Sanderson,Because you've had runins with Miss Knope in the past.
Dave Sanderson,Just a second.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Ask him about the peach pit.
Greg Pikitis,"This isn't one way glass, you know."
Greg Pikitis,I can see you.
Greg Pikitis,"You know, I like Knope."
Greg Pikitis,"I screw with her 'cause she gets all riled up, and her face gets all scrunched up like this."
Greg Pikitis,But I like her.
Greg Pikitis,She's all right.
Greg Pikitis,You see?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,"I spent the whole day decorating this place, and everybody's in the kitchen."
Ann Perkins,Why is everyone always in the kitchen?
Mark Brendanawicz,I think it's going fine.
Ann Perkins,It's so quiet.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,This is a total failure.
Ann Perkins,This party is a failure.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's not a failure, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"Ann, do you have any Mounds?"
Ron Swanson,Because all I can find are Almond Joys.
Ron Swanson,And almonds give me the squirts.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm here."
Andy Dwyer,Statue's fine.
Andy Dwyer,"""Crappy Hallowieners."""
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,Where's the kid?
Leslie Knope,In the conference room.
Leslie Knope,Trying to hide his obvious guilt.
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I don't know what to tell you."
Dave Sanderson,I don't think he did it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he did."
Leslie Knope,And we need a confession.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Andy and I are going to take a walk.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers."
Dave Sanderson,"Look, I'm not gonna torture this kid."
Leslie Knope,Nobody said torture.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you let me take a run at him, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,"In order to think like one of these guys, you have to think like them."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He's never seen you before.
Leslie Knope,So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.
Andy Dwyer,Greg Pikitis?
Andy Dwyer,Would you like some boiling hot coffee in your face?
Andy Dwyer,My name is Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,I'm with the [bleep] FBI.
Ron Swanson,Ooh.
Ron Swanson,Are these the same kind of chips?
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous!"
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,"Get your Raggedy ass over here, girl."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tom."
Ann Perkins,Mad Hatter?
Tom Haverford,"T Pain, baby!"
Tom Haverford,"She poppin', she rollin', she rollin' She climbin' that pole and I'm in love with a stripper"
Tom Haverford,This is not a stripper.
Tom Haverford,"It's my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,You remember her?
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,Thank you so much for inviting us.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, hi."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"She's a surgeon at County General, and she's super hot."
Ann Perkins,"Well, thank you for being a doctor and not coming dressed as a doctor."
Wendy,"Oh, my God."
Wendy,Who'd be boring enough to do that?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, what happened here?"
Tom Haverford,Did you tell everyone they're gonna have to get a bone marrow transplant tomorrow?
Tom Haverford,They look miserable.
Tom Haverford,This party's a disaster.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it is."
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,We can fix this.
Wendy,Totally.
Tom Haverford,Give us a second.
Leslie Knope,Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go finish him off.
Greg Pikitis,That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just shut up for a second?
Leslie Knope,What's going on in here?
Andy Dwyer,He's a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,He's being such a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,That's an awful thing to say to a human being!
Greg Pikitis,Are you crying?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I am not crying, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm allergic to jerks!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, out."
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, and I don't even care!"
Andy Dwyer,It's stupid--
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The gloves are coming off.
Greg Pikitis,What's that?
Leslie Knope,I think you know what that is.
Leslie Knope,"When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach."
Leslie Knope,"Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?"
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg."
Greg Pikitis,"Wow, you nailed me."
Greg Pikitis,"I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana."
Greg Pikitis,Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me earlier.
Leslie Knope,I know you did this.
Leslie Knope,I don't care what you say.
Leslie Knope,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.
Leslie Knope,Somehow you found a way to get in here--
Greg Pikitis,"Wait, wait, wait."
Greg Pikitis,How did you know that I was in the parking lot all night?
Leslie Knope,"Because I followed you, genius!"
Greg Pikitis,If you followed me all night then you know that it wasn't me.
Greg Pikitis,"Knope, what is your problem?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have been very civil."
Leslie Knope,But I will waterboard you.
Dave Sanderson,"No, nope."
Dave Sanderson,I don't think she would make a good cop.
Dave Sanderson,"I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?"
Ann Perkins,Course I do.
Tom Haverford,"All right, then relax."
Tom Haverford,And turn off all the lights that don't have colored bulbs.
Tom Haverford,"All right, y'all!"
Tom Haverford,Take the pigs in the blanket and put them to sleep!
Tom Haverford,It's time to get wild!
Tom Haverford,"Get this furniture out of here, y'all, we're making a dance floor."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, y'all."
Tom Haverford,Put the turkey wraps down.
Tom Haverford,We're about to get wild.
Tom Haverford,"Ron Swanson's in the building, y'all!"
Leslie Knope,His mom's gonna be here soon.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Dave, just arrest him."
Dave Sanderson,On what charge?
Leslie Knope,Just handcuff him to something.
Greg's Mom,Greggy?
Greg's Mom,Greg!
Greg's Mom,Gregsy!
Greg Pikitis,Mom!
Leslie Knope,Mrs. Pikitis?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Greg's Mom,What the hell do you think you're doing?
Greg's Mom,You can't just hold a 16 year old kid against his will.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism."
Greg's Mom,Do you have any evidence?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,We don't.
Leslie Knope,"Two words, peach pit."
Greg's Mom,Peach pit?
Leslie Knope,"His DNA is all over it, I assume."
Dave Sanderson,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,We can get it tested.
Dave Sanderson,We can't.
Leslie Knope,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time."
Dave Sanderson,It won't.
Greg's Mom,Is this a joke?
Leslie Knope,No.
Greg's Mom,I'm calling your shift commander.
Greg's Mom,"Monday morning, I am calling your boss."
Greg's Mom,I don't know who to call about you--
Andy Dwyer,The President of the United States of America.
Greg's Mom,Fine.
Greg's Mom,"And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to God I will sue you and everyone in this building."
Greg's Mom,"Come on, honey."
Leslie Knope,Let them think they've lost us.
Leslie Knope,Then we're--
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Dave Sanderson,I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.
Dave Sanderson,It's just... It's just bad police work.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too."
Andy Dwyer,My bad.
Tom Haverford,"Tonight, the ""T"" in T-Pain stands for Tom Haverford!"
Tom Haverford,Nurses versus doctors.
Tom Haverford,"On my mark, three, two, one."
Tom Haverford,Go!
Tom Haverford,Vodka!
All,Go!
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,That is one hell of a costume.
Ben,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, that's good."
Ron Swanson,Nice party.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Why would anyone do this?
Andy Dwyer,Kids are kids.
Andy Dwyer,Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.
Leslie Knope,I didn't.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I mean that in a good way."
Andy Dwyer,Look at you now.
Andy Dwyer,You're the coolest person I've ever met.
Andy Dwyer,I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why don't you go home?"
Leslie Knope,I'll finish cleaning this up.
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around."
Andy Dwyer,I go home when you go home.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, it's city planning."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.
Nurse,You wanna get out of here?
Nurse,Go back to my place?
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm dating Ann.
Nurse,Good.
Nurse,That was a test.
Nurse,You passed.
Nurse,"Let's celebrate you passing the test, over a drink, at my place."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Still no.
Nurse,You passed the second test.
Nurse,But we're still watching you.
Nurse,"So, you wanna get out of here, go back to my place?"
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy,Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Wendy."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you and Tom really turned the party around."
Wendy,We have a good time together.
Wendy,Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage.
Wendy,And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone.
Ron Swanson,No worries.
Ron Swanson,I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada.
Ron Swanson,All that socialized medicine up there.
Tom Haverford,Wendylicious.
Tom Haverford,Where have you been?
Wendy,I was just thanking Ron.
Wendy,"For, you know, not telling anyone."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,That was cool of you.
Wendy,"You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows."
Wendy,And we'll invite you to the divorce party.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, maybe Greg is innocent."
Leslie Knope,"If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.
Leslie Knope,That's the cornerstone of democracy.
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk."
Leslie Knope,And I kind of wanna TP his house.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do?"
Andy Dwyer,"You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree."
Leslie Knope,This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court!
Leslie Knope,Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it!
Ann Perkins,"Bye, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz,Bye.
Ann Perkins,"You're the man, Swanson."
Ann Perkins,Thanks for coming.
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Ann Perkins,Dude.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
Ann Perkins,I don't even know what to say.
Tom Haverford,Don't mention it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Also, Tom, your wife is super cool."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, well done."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, she's pretty great, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know how you landed that chick, but she's awesome."
Ann Perkins,Nice work.
Ann Perkins,You're lucky.
Wendy,"Hi, you ready to go?"
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Wendy,All right.
Wendy,Thank you so much.
Wendy,We had so much fun.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, thank you."
Tom Haverford,About to head home and have crazy sex.
Ann Perkins,That's cool.
Ann Perkins,I don't--
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Five-O! Five-O!
Andy Dwyer,"I see you in there, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Leslie? What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Greg's Mom,"That's them, Officer! Right there!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house."
Greg's Mom,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,"It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong."
Greg's Mom,I'm Greg's mom.
Leslie Knope,You are?
Greg's Mom,Yes.
Greg's Mom,Oh.
Greg's Mom,"Did he hire a fake mom again, to get him out of trouble?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Greg's Mom,"Whenever he gets in trouble, he goes on Craigslist and hires a woman to play his mother and bail him out."
Greg's Mom,"Oh, that little SOB! Greg! Gregory!"
Leslie Knope,I knew it!
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Dude.
Andy Dwyer,That kid is amazing.
Greg's Mom,He's not in his room.
Greg's Mom,I don't know where he is.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Make sure you--
Extra,"I need more, man."
Dave Sanderson,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Let them go! Stay on the leader!
Greg's Mom,I am gonna wring your neck!
Leslie Knope,How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know.
Greg Pikitis,Maybe the FBI can figure it out.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not even in the FBI, stupid."
Greg Pikitis,"Wow, you're amazing."
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.
Greg Pikitis,You can't--
Dave Sanderson,"He's not gonna go to jail, you know."
Dave Sanderson,He's a minor.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the jury decide."
Dave Sanderson,There's not gonna be a jury--
Leslie Knope,Then the judge will decide where he goes.
Dave Sanderson,Look.
Dave Sanderson,"He's going to do probation, he's a minor."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, just let me have this."
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Nice work, Knope."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,That is amazing.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?"
Ann Perkins,"If you destroy him early, please come by."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Ann Perkins,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Jerry Gergich,Oh! What the... Are you
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we were here all afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave."
Leslie Knope,And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m. to the moment we came back here.
Leslie Knope,"Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?"
