Tom Haverford,"because as of today, his bank account is blowing up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I made my money the old fashioned way, I got run over by a Lexus."
Tom Haverford,"I still can't believe you made all that money in the lawsuit, you barely got hurt at all."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"do you want to get run over, because I know a guy, super gentle, minor scrapes and bruises, major dollars and cents."
Tom Haverford,I got it.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I know it, we both know it, let's both say it at the same it."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, why why."
Tom Haverford,You gotta stop screaming.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I will I just get excited.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why do we call it entertainment 720?
Tom Haverford,because you're willing to go around the world twice for your clients.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is unbelievable, but listen to me, listen to me."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna need you on my team to pull this off, all right?"

Leslie Knope,"I have some very important news about our favorite minihorse, Li'I Sebastian."
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,Li'I Sebastian!
Leslie Knope,He died last night.
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,"But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most."
Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.
Ron Swanson,"When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at halfmast, I thought, ""All right."""
Ron Swanson,Another bureaucrat ate it.
Ron Swanson,But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.
Ron Swanson,Halfmast is too high.
Ron Swanson,Show some damned respect.
Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him."
Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence."
Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life."
Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.
Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner."
Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.
Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Ann, how's it going."
Ann Perkins,You don't have to pretend I know you're supposed to meet Leslie here.
Ben Wyatt,I'm also curious about how it's going.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's busy, she's working on the Li'l Sebastian memorial service."
Ann Perkins,"But you know what, she gave me this note to give to you."
Ann Perkins,"And she also wanted me to kiss you deeply, which I'm gonna have to pass on."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I really like my part-time job here.
Ann Perkins,"My office mate moved down the hall, so I have this whole room just for me."
Ann Perkins,"And Ben and Leslie, who secretly meet here."
Ann Perkins,40 times a day.
Ben Wyatt,She drew a kiss monster on the note.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys are totally welcome to use my office."
Ann Perkins,Just don't do anything on my desk
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we don't, you know, we just like to work in the same place."
Ben Wyatt,and then we talk and hold hands.
Ann Perkins,"Yuck, that's somehow worse."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it sounded bad when I said it."
Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life."
Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.
Ron Swanson,"Amen, we need to send that glorious beast into the great beyond with a display that rivals the Super Bowl Halftime Show."
Ron Swanson,Also the budget is 600 dollars.
Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song."
Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better."
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
April Ludgate,"Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000."
Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so"
Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.
April Ludgate,Sold.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
Ben Wyatt,It's just a list of facts.
Leslie Knope,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine says, ""You have a cute butt."""
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, ""You have a cube butt."""
Tom Haverford,Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?"
Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Ben Wyatt,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Tom Haverford,"Cube butt, cube butt."
April Ludgate,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Andy Dwyer,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Dr. Harris,"Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis."
Chris Traeger,How is that good news?
Dr. Harris,The other option was shoulder cancer.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,"Look, you exercise a lot."
Dr. Harris,You're in great shape.
Dr. Harris,Little things like this happen with men of your age.
Chris Traeger,Men of my age?
Chris Traeger,How old do you think I am?
Dr. Harris,Fortytwo.
Chris Traeger,"I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150."
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's the cure?
Dr. Harris,Get a time machine.
Dr. Harris,Go back to being 20.
Chris Traeger,"Dr. Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral."
Ron Swanson,What was that tone?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,I'm very sad about this.
Tom Haverford,Question!
Tom Haverford,Who's a genius?
Tom Haverford,"Answer, Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub."
Tom Haverford,Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.
Ron Swanson,Jean-Ralphio is a clown.
Ron Swanson,"This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double coupon night at a strip club."
Tom Haverford,"First off, double coupon night is an incredible value."
Tom Haverford,"Secondly, this guy just started a business."
Tom Haverford,He's my friend.
Tom Haverford,It would really help him out.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you."
Leslie Knope,Make us proud.
Ron Swanson,Make him proud.
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just Photoshop that out?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hi, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Ann Perkins,What?
Chris Traeger,Tendonitis.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know if you should lead with ""I'm dying."""
Chris Traeger,"You're right, you're right."
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's up with you?
Ann Perkins,I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.
Chris Traeger,Li'I Sebastian died?
Chris Traeger,That's terrible.
Ann Perkins,"He was old, and he had a lot of ailments."
Ann Perkins,Like tendonitis?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,I don't have his chart in front of me.
Chris Traeger,Could you get it?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,No There's no chart.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Death is inescapable.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?"
Ann Perkins,What are you going for?
Leslie Knope,Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Ann Perkins,Bullseye.
Ann Perkins,It's so nice to see you so happy about a guy.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect."
Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows."
Ann Perkins,I could see that.
Leslie Knope,But enough about me.
Leslie Knope,How's Ann?
Ann Perkins,I'm pretty happy right now generally.
Ann Perkins,Although I did see Chris today.
Ann Perkins,he always just throws me off.
Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us."
Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, there you go."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting and wrong.
Leslie Knope,I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically."
Leslie Knope,"And he is terrible, facewise."
Leslie Knope,"And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe you are.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Check and mate.
Leslie Knope,This is an outrage!
Leslie Knope,Who do I call?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, you're just who I was looking for."
Ben Wyatt,Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing?
Ben Wyatt,"Can we just, uh Did you bring it?"
Ben Wyatt,This isn't convincing.
Leslie Knope,How did you find out?
Ron Swanson,We've worked together for a while now.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to think I know you pretty well.
Ron Swanson,"Plus, Ben buttdialed me last night."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Eleanor likes the tongue.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, show me Pelosi again."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, lay down."
Leslie Knope,Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Ron Swanson,Unfortunately not.
Ron Swanson,This is a scandal waiting to happen.
Ron Swanson,"If you get caught, which you clearly will, Chris will fire you."
Ron Swanson,And I won't be able to stop him.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, we're being very careful."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, President, Reagan, my blazer popped open."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Maggie Thatcher, let me help you with that."
Ben Wyatt,it's going to be a bumpy ride to this summit meeting.
Ben Wyatt,Our countries have a very special relationship.
Leslie Knope,Oh no.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you've proven your point."
Andy Dwyer,"In my heart, I'm sad you had to die."
Andy Dwyer,"Li'l horse, spread your wings and learn to fly."
April Ludgate,Horses don't fly.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I'm telling them learn to fly.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, help me."
Andy Dwyer,There's a lot riding on this.
Andy Dwyer,This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.
April Ludgate,"Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far."
Andy Dwyer,You're a champion little horse And you're dead You're the champion of death You're the champion of death
April Ludgate,"Maybe try to do one without the word ""dead"" so much."
April Ludgate,"Or ""death"" or ""you're dead."""
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,You're helping me already.
Leslie Knope,"So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron."
Leslie Knope,And they're not gonna say anything.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Just no more fooling around at work.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, kind of like this."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Oh, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope,That feels appropriate.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this."
Extra,"Hey, lovebirds."
Extra,What do I do with this?
Leslie Knope,You can just leave it there.
Extra,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy."
Tom Haverford,For the memorial ribbons?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No doubt.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Which one floats your penis?
Jerry Gergich,They're all black.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe to the layman, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"Obsidian, onyx, midnight, lost soul, rolling blackout, sleeping panther, and void by Armani."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jerry, does this look black to you, too?"
Chris Traeger,"Ann, so glad I found you."
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you for a minute.
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay."
Chris Traeger,"I need to ask you a question, and if you're uncomfortable answering it right now, you can take some time and think about it."
Chris Traeger,That would be okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Chris Traeger,Is tendonitis symptomatic of something larger?
Ann Perkins,"Really, that's that's a question you wanted to ask me?"
Chris Traeger,"I'm just very worried, I'm not sure this doctor's been properly trained."
Ann Perkins,"You know what, Chris, I'm sorry, I'm not your nurse, and I'm not your girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,"And I thought I was twice and I was wrong, which was embarassing."
Ann Perkins,I'm just not ready to be your friend.
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,I do hope we can be friends before I die.
Leslie Knope,Hey friend.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Ben Wyatt,I was just congratulating her because she got some good news.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, right."

Ben Wyatt,You should just take the rest of the day off.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,You should do that and you should get a massage.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate actually, my mom gave it to me for you."
Ben Wyatt,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"That's so nice, that's so nice."

Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Extra,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,It's great to see you George.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Sebastian may have been li'I, but his impact on this town and the Parks Department was anything but li'I."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to introduce his owner's, Michael and Elizabeth Stone, and two of his closest friends."
Tom Haverford,"Cue music and lights, and Go Ladybug, go Coconut."
Tom Haverford,Coconut and Ladybug both in position.
Leslie Knope,"Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover."
Leslie Knope,Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump on the stage.
Tom Haverford,We gotta clean that up.
Tom Haverford,Code red.
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump onstage.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,The maintenance guy bailed on us.
Tom Haverford,No one knows where he is.
Tom Haverford,He had the fuel for the eternal flame.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,That guy left?
Leslie Knope,What a Okay.
Leslie Knope,Start the video presentation.
Leslie Knope,I'll deal with it.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to go get some propane."
Jerry Gergich,"No, what about my poem?"
Leslie Knope,"No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane."
Jerry Gergich,Fine.
Jerry Gergich,I'll do it for Li'I Sebastian.
Tom Haverford,"Now we have a special presentation, courtesy of the folks at Entertainment 7Twenty."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hope you brought a change of clothes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,'Cause your eyes are about to piss tears.
Donna Meagle,You nasty.
Tom Haverford,Who are we?
Tom Haverford,Where are we going in life?
Tom Haverford,What is the meaning of all of this?
Tom Haverford,These are questions Li'I Sebastian never had to answer because he was a horse.
Tom Haverford,"Instead, he just brought us joy and happiness."
Tom Haverford,And isn't that the point?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You gotta join the company.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm the bank.
Tom Haverford,You're the money.
Tom Haverford,"I know, J, but it'd be a big leap."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And I will take that leap with you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm Thelma, you're Louise."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You can't die full of regret.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why don't you live your life like that cow from the video?
Tom Haverford,He was a horse.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Because he followed his dreams.
Tom Haverford,There was no obstacle too large.
Tom Haverford,No mountain too high.
Tom Haverford,No valley too low.
Tom Haverford,"Li'I Sebastian had a long life, filled with wonder."
Tom Haverford,"Good night, Li'I Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,Forever.
Leslie Knope,We'd like to encourage everyone to buy our merchandise.
Leslie Knope,"All the proceeds will go towards Li'I Sebastian's favorite charity, the Afghan Institute of Learning."
Leslie Knope,"Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr."
Leslie Knope,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?"
Andy Dwyer,"This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind."
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven Here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings And once we've all said goodbye You take a running leap and you learn to fly Byebye, Li'I Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Byebye, Li'I Sebastian You're 5,000 candles in the wind Hey, why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?"
Ben Wyatt,Why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?
Leslie Knope,"Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it?"
Leslie Knope,Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
Leslie Knope,This is sort of a mess.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay, we're--"
Ron Swanson,"What the hell, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.
Ron Swanson,Why is Councilman Howser doing it?
Leslie Knope,Because you are doing something better.
Leslie Knope,"You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, congratulations."
Leslie Knope,"I saved it for you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Who caught you guys?
Leslie Knope,"A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us."
Ben Wyatt,It's totally fine.
Ron Swanson,"I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches."
Ron Swanson,I have cried twice in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus."
Ron Swanson,And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.
Ron Swanson,"His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, deep breath."
Ben Wyatt,I think we got through it.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, they were out."
Jerry Gergich,So I just got a big thing of lighter fluid.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of the same thing.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,We planned that!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, wow!"
Leslie Knope,We planned that.
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,"Please, Ron, I am very sorry."
Jerry Gergich,I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,I think you're being hard on yourself.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, are you mad at me?"
Jerry Gergich,"'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.
Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable."
Ben Wyatt,"What, you want to break up?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then You want to tell Chris."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like my job.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, what do we do?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, operation shutdown."
Leslie Knope,No more secret handholding.
Leslie Knope,No more smooching in Ann's office.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, I'm in."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's force of habit."
Tom Haverford,"So what do I do, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Do I stay here or roll the dice with JeanRalphio?
Tom Haverford,I can't tell you what to do.
Ron Swanson,Go with your gut.
Tom Haverford,My gut is really small and easily irritated.
Tom Haverford,I need someone to guide me.
Ron Swanson,"You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude."
Ron Swanson,"I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,It'll be damn hard to replace you.
Ron Swanson,But I'll support you either way.
Tammy 2,Two of my lovers in one place.
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Ooh, what happened here?"
Tammy 2,"And more importantly, does the carpet match the face?"
Ron Swanson,"If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else."
Ron Swanson,"An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face."
Ron Swanson,And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Tammy 2,Tell that to your pants tent.
Ron Swanson,It's just the way I'm standing.
Ron Swanson,"Go back to the library, where you belong."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Glenn."
Tammy 2,Wanna dance?
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm okay."
Tammy 2,Just one dance?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tammy 2,With mommy?
Ann Perkins,"You know, tendonitis is usually caused by overuse."
Ann Perkins,Have you been working out more than usual?
Chris Traeger,"I did do 10,000 pushups last week."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really."
Ann Perkins,That might have something to do with it.
Ann Perkins,You need to relax.
Ann Perkins,You're in great shape.
Chris Traeger,For a 44 year old.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"That's how old you are, man."
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,I've been overreacting.
Chris Traeger,I don't like thinking about death.
Chris Traeger,Death is the opposite of
Ann Perkins,Being alive?
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,Look at us.
Chris Traeger,Talking like friends.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,Friends.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,"What's the point in doing 10,000 pushups if you're gonna do them alone?"
Chris Traeger,"I'd much rather do 5,000 pushups with a wonderful woman."
Chris Traeger,Sitting on my back to increase my resistance.
Andy Dwyer,"Copy of our new hit single, 5,000 Candles in the Wind, and the new full-length CD, The Awesome Album."
April Ludgate,"Eighteen bucks each, 40 dollars for the set."
Kyle,That doesn't add up.
April Ludgate,You don't add up.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, you are awesome at this."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,"April, I need to ask you something, and it's the biggest thing I've ever asked anybody in my entire life."
April Ludgate,"Honey, we're already married."
Andy Dwyer,"No, this is way more important than that."
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate, would you be my manager?"
April Ludgate,Seriously? Okay.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
William Barnes,Excuse me.
William Barnes,Are you Leslie Knope?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
William Barnes,My name is William Barnes.
William Barnes,Do you have a minute to talk?

Leslie Knope,I'm glad.
Leslie Knope,'Cause it was planned.
William Barnes,"And you were also responsible for the Harvest Festival, correct?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, a lot of people contributed to that."
William Barnes,You don't have to be modest.
William Barnes,We know it was you.
William Barnes,You did an amazing job.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
William Barnes,We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
William Barnes,And we think that you might fit the bill.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Which office in particular?
Elizabeth Barnes,"Well, there are a couple city council seats we think are vulnerable."
Elizabeth Barnes,And the mayor's term is up next year.
William Barnes,All we need to know right now is are you theoretically interested in running for office?
Leslie Knope,"Absotootly, I am."
Leslie Knope,Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope,But yes.
Leslie Knope,I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Tammy 2,Guess I'll be heading home.
Ron Swanson,Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole?
Tammy 2,"Actually, I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station."
Donna Meagle,"Red alert, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,Your ex-wife is back.
Ron Swanson,"No kidding, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Not her.
Donna Meagle,The other ex-wife.
Ron Swanson,Tammy One.
Donna Meagle,She's in your office.
Leslie Knope,Would I have to quit my job?
William Barnes,"Well, that's a long way off."
Leslie Knope,Of course.
William Barnes,But listen.
William Barnes,"When you run, even in a local election, your life becomes an open book."
William Barnes,"So if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip or use a government stamp for personal mail, it will come out."
William Barnes,"So before we go any further, I need you to tell me, is there a scandal out there? Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?"
Leslie Knope,Nope.
William Barnes,All right.
William Barnes,"Well, we'll be in touch."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I think we can do that for a million."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we'll talk soon."
Tom Haverford,"There was no one on the other end of that phone call, but soon there will be."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to the Dreamatorium, A.K.A. the headquarters of Entertainment 720."
Tom Haverford,"We got a pool table, a ping-pong table, a couch with a ceiling on it, in-house DJ."
Tom Haverford,DJ Blunt.
Tom Haverford,"And best of all, former NBA superstar Detlef Schrempf is on retainer."
Tom Haverford,"What's up, Detlef?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jean-Ralphio, who's sitting at my clear purple desk."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Tom Haverford,Who's this person?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oh you're talking about this little sweetie right here?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This is our new assistant Tessa.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I saw her sweating real sweaty on the stairmaster.
Extra,"I need petty cash, my iPhone cover is gross and I need to get a new one."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get it to match your personality.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Petty cash, money bowl, go diving."
Extra,Gross.
Tom Haverford,Why do we keep our petty cash in a clear plastic toilet bowl?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Maybe because we're flush with cash.
Detlef Schrempf,"So, Tom, what does this business do, again?"
Tom Haverford,It's a multimedia entertainment production conglomerate.
Detlef Schrempf,"I don't know, man."
Detlef Schrempf,You have a lot of overhead here.
Detlef Schrempf,Ever thought about scaling back a bit and focusing on building your client base?
Tom Haverford,"Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine."
Tom Haverford,But we didn't hire you to give us business advice.
Tom Haverford,We hired you to look pretty and shoot baskets.
Tom Haverford,"So why don't you head over there and do your thing? We want people to see you when they come in, Detlef."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"We may not have any clients yet, but we're about to blow up."
Tom Haverford,"First you set up the pond, then you real in the fish."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Big D, hit me! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come on.
Tom Haverford,We're living the dream.
