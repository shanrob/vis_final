Ann Perkins,"Mr. Hotate, hi."
Ann Perkins,Thank you for coming.
Ann Perkins,Would you like some water?
Ken Hotate,Water?
Ken Hotate,Like fire water?
Ken Hotate,"That's racist, and I do not appreciate it."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,I didn't mean it like that.
Ann Perkins,"I just meant, you know"
Ken Hotate,I'm just messing with you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,He's funny.
Leslie Knope,This guy's funny.
Leslie Knope,He does that sometimes.
Ken Hotate,But seriously.
Ken Hotate,I'll have a whiskey.
Leslie Knope,"Ken Hotate is the leader of the Wamapoke people, and we are trying to get them involved in our Pawnee Commons project."
Leslie Knope,Ken and I get along great.
Leslie Knope,"But historically, Pawnee's relationship with the Wamapoke has been more Murdery."
Ken Hotate,What about and I'm just spitballing here a large neon advertisement for the Wamapoke casino?
Ken Hotate,"We have a new slogan that I'm quite proud of: ""Our slots are downright filthy."""
April Ludgate,I think it's a slam dunk idea.
April Ludgate,I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think we are.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if we could put that in a public park.
Ken Hotate,"In that case, the playground will be great."
Ken Hotate,Why don't we retire to my longhouse and smoke the ceremonial peace pipe to celebrate?
Ann Perkins,Is he joking?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."
Ann Perkins,If it isn't Mr. Best Man and Bachelor boy.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, Maid of Honor, are you ready for the bachelorette party?"
Ann Perkins,"Uh, more than ready."
Ann Perkins,"We've got dancing, Jello shots, private karaoke, and anything that can be penis shaped will be penis shaped."
Leslie Knope,Ohhh!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"As Leslie's maid of honor, I really need her bachelorette party to go well."
Ann Perkins,Which is why I'm stress eating gummy penises.
Leslie Knope,What are you losers doing for your bachelor party?
Chris Traeger,I told Ben he could do whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Sky is the limit.
Chris Traeger,"We have Haverford, Swanson, Dwyer Jerry forced his way in there somehow things are bound to get crazy."
Ben Wyatt,The game is Settlers of Catan.
Ben Wyatt,The object is be the first to build a civilization on this fictional island.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe this is what you want to do for your bachelor party.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, we don't have to play this game if you don't want to."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I'm nationally ranked, so it isn't even really fair."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, this is your night."
Chris Traeger,We do what you want to do.
Chris Traeger,"Come on, let's play."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not a big bachelor party kind of guy, so when the guys asked me what my perfect night would be, I told them the truth beer and board games."
Ben Wyatt,They thought I was kidding.
Ben Wyatt,I was not kidding.
April Ludgate,"Is this gonna be one of those cool bachelorette parties where things get out of control and we murder someone, and then we all have to take a blood oath to never reveal our secret?"
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Then I might have to leave early.
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well."
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you ladies look nice For once?
Jeremy Jamm,Just kidding.
Jeremy Jamm,I've actually always been attracted to this one.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, what the hell are you doing?"
Kathryn Pinewood,We're laying the groundwork for Pawnee's newest restaurant.
April Ludgate,"""Future home of Paunch Burger."
April Ludgate,"Start drooling, fatties""?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, the deal was that both of us had three months to get our proposals together, and then we put it up for a vote."
Leslie Knope,We still have two weeks left.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, that's true."
Jeremy Jamm,"However, here's the problem."
Jeremy Jamm,"Turns out, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,You can't stop this train.
Jeremy Jamm,Make all the ruckus you want.
Jeremy Jamm,"By the time this all gets cleared up, the people will be frothing at the mouth for that beef."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Aw, sweet!"
Bjorn Lerpiss,A new Paunch Burger.
April Ludgate,Their burgers will kill you!
April Ludgate,They're full of wasps!
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Yeah, but they taste real good."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Yes, they do, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,"Once again, open invitation."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm still technically married, but my wife knows the deal."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm sorry, what's this?"
Ben Wyatt,"Seven contiguous segments, giving me longest road and a sweetass ten points for the win."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, booyah!"
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,Gather round.
Chris Traeger,I want to propose a toast.
Chris Traeger,"To our new Lord of Catan, Ben Wyatt, a great friend and a wonderful man."
Chris Traeger,May you and Leslie find eternal happiness together.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for indulging me.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you want to stick around?"
Ben Wyatt,I got a bunch of Homeland episodes burning a hole in my DVR.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"On principle, I cannot stand idly by and watch a bachelor party peter out like this."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I know you said no strippers 'cause they make you sad."
Ben Wyatt,Correct.
Tom Haverford,Then let's go get a drink at Essence.
Tom Haverford,It's the hot new bar in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,Things Magazine said it's the next big thing.
Chris Traeger,"But, Tom, this is Ben's night."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, believe me, if the group's happy, I'm happy."
Jerry Gergich,I'd go.
Andy Dwyer,If you guys spot me.
Andy Dwyer,It sounds expensive.
Tom Haverford,"Just so you know, it's not your typical bar."
Tom Haverford,They specialize in molecular mixology.
Tom Haverford,It's kind of like an experimental new way to consume alcohol.
Ron Swanson,"Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol."
Extra,Here's your Bud light.
Andy Dwyer,I ordered a beer.
Extra,That is a beer.
Extra,And here's your Nimbus Martini.
Extra,May I go ahead and chisel your aromasphere?
Tom Haverford,Please!
Ron Swanson,This is the wrong way to consume alcohol.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, that's a pretty stiff cloud."
Extra,Who ordered the Scotch?
Ron Swanson,Right here.
Extra,"Hold out your hands, please."
Ron Swanson,What's happening?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is a sort of play on Scotch."
Tom Haverford,It's a whiskey infused lotion.
Ron Swanson,Can I ask if this entire establishment is a practical joke of some kind?
Tom Haverford,"If you don't like the Scotch, they have a vodka that's served in the form of a flash of light."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Having fun?
Leslie Knope,"Well, four years of work down the drain, and I have a penis on my head."
Leslie Knope,Jamm is stealing this lot right out from under us.
Leslie Knope,"My dream is dead, Ann."
April Ludgate,Mine too.
April Ludgate,This is why I prefer nightmares.
Ann Perkins,"You are sad drinking right now, and I need you to be happy drinking."
Ann Perkins,Like when we watch Grease together.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, but everything's gonna disappear."
Leslie Knope,"April's mini dog park, the Li'l Sebastian fountain, even the Wamapoke playground."
Leslie Knope,Yet another piece of Wamapoke land plowed over by the white man.
Ann Perkins,Just try to forget about it.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, there's nothing you can do to stop them tonight."
Leslie Knope,"For almost 200 years, Pawnee repeatedly built factories, restaurants, and other stuff on land held sacred by the Wamapoke people."
Leslie Knope,"So we passed a law saying that if any sacred Wamapoke artifact is found on a development site, all construction must immediately stop."
Leslie Knope,It would be terrible if that were to happen on this future Paunch Burger site.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is bad."
Leslie Knope,I should not have done this.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I wonder who that is."
Ann Perkins,"Well, if it isn't Babe Lincoln!"
Ann Perkins,Imagine that.
Extra,"Hello, ladies."
Extra,I'm Abraham Lincoln.
Extra,Who's the lucky Mary Todd?
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Donna Meagle,"Ah, ah, ah, me first."
Donna Meagle,Me first.
Extra,"Oh, okay."
Donna Meagle,"All right, tear it up, 16!"
Donna Meagle,Emancipate them abs.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ann, not now."
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Leslie, just loosen up."
Ann Perkins,I know for a fact this is a sex dream you've had.
Extra,Looks like it's time for the Gettysburg undressed!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna have to stop now.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for historical nudity."
Leslie Knope,"Please, Mr. president, put your pants back on."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can I speak with you privately?"
April Ludgate,Is your name Glenn?
Extra,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I sat behind you in middle school band.
April Ludgate,Do you still play the clarinet?
Extra,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"How have you been, man?"
Tom Haverford,"Man, if I ever have a bachelor party, I am definitely coming back here."
Chris Traeger,You never had one before you were married to Wendy?
Tom Haverford,"No, it was a green card wedding."
Tom Haverford,"I did watch the threeway sex scene from Wild Things a few times the night before, but it didn't really count."
Andy Dwyer,I never had a bachelor party either.
Andy Dwyer,"Me and April, we got married with no warning."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even have time to take a shower before my wedding.
Andy Dwyer,Or after.
Andy Dwyer,"For, like, a week and a half."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy One forbade me from any kind of celebration, and Tammy Two thwarted me by calling in a bomb threat to the steakhouse."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't have one either!
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, really, it's a funny story."
Jerry Gergich,"So two weeks before I married Gayle, I had an emergency appendectomy."
Tom Haverford,Boop!
Tom Haverford,That's me hitting the snooze button.
Tom Haverford,Don't talk again for another ten minutes.
Chris Traeger,New idea!
Chris Traeger,"Tonight, everyone gets the bachelor party they never had."
Chris Traeger,One activity per bachelor.
Chris Traeger,"Welcome to Tom's bachelor party, held in a white airplane hangar from the ice planet Hoth, replete with dangling, beautiful aerialists."
Chris Traeger,To Tom Haverford.
Ben Wyatt,To Tom Haverford!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey and to my bride, Rihanna."
Tom Haverford,We truly did find love in a hopeless place.
Tom Haverford,"Waiter, a round of light flash shots for me and my friends!"
Ben Wyatt,Ohhh!
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what happened?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I buried a bunch of Wamapoke artifacts in the dirt so that people would find them and have to stop developing at the site."
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad."
Ann Perkins,"No, that's bad."
Extra,"Yeah, that's pretty uncool."
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Glenn."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm was being sneaky, and then I tried to sneaky him back, and it turned to crummy, and I have to undo it."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Ann Perkins,You don't mean
Leslie Knope,I do.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I'm not doing that.
April Ludgate,"You guys, the penis hats cut your digging time in half."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Don't be afraid.
April Ludgate,Use the penises.
Ann Perkins,Bachelorette party.
Ann Perkins,Whoo.
Ann Perkins,Perkins does it again.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I met Gayle right here at Sherm's."
Andy Dwyer,Mmmm.
Jerry Gergich,She was slender.
Jerry Gergich,"Blonde hair, big breasts, long legs."
Jerry Gergich,"Ugh, not my type at all."
Ben Wyatt,"And what was it, exactly, that led to you two hitting it off?"
Ben Wyatt,"Was she ill, or did your father witness her father committing a crime?"
Ben Wyatt,Or was she temporarily blind
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,"All that matters is that you got married, and you're happy."
Chris Traeger,"So as all time best man, I suggest we raise a cone to Jerry Gergich."
Ben Wyatt,Jerry Gergich.
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Gergich.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Extra,"No worries, Gary."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thanks, Sherm."
Ben Wyatt,How did you have that ready so fast?
Extra,I always make a backup cone.
Extra,He drops it about half the time.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, you're next."
Chris Traeger,Any activity in the world.
Chris Traeger,What would you do?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, mine's impossible."
Andy Dwyer,I want to see a Colts game.
Andy Dwyer,"I want to see the Colts beat the Patriots 49 to nothing, then I yell at Tom Brady and make him cry, then I hook up with Dave Matthews, and we play golden tee for ten hours."
Andy Dwyer,Alala baby
Ron Swanson,"that's a very specific dream, son."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jim, Chris Traeger."
Chris Traeger,I need a favor.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dead.
Andy Dwyer,I am dead.
Andy Dwyer,And this is what heaven is like.
Andy Dwyer,I knew it.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is where they play the games!"
Jerry Gergich,"You're up, Andy."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys!"
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want you to meet Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay."
Jim Irsay,"Andy, good to meet you, my friend."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"I love your team, sir."
Andy Dwyer,I love them like they're my own children.
Jim Irsay,"You're big enough to play football yourself, it looks like to me."
Andy Dwyer,"I can't tell if you're joking, but I hope you're not."
Jim Irsay,This whole place is yours.
Chris Traeger,Jim Irsay and I became friends while volunteering to mentor Indianapolis teens.
Chris Traeger,I gave them tours of the state house.
Chris Traeger,Jim gave them Colts tickets and autographed jerseys.
Chris Traeger,They preferred Jim.
Andy Dwyer,Reggie Wayne.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't look at you, Reggie Wayne."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I got married in your jersey.
Andy Dwyer,That's no joke.
Reggie Wayne,That's weird.
Reggie Wayne,But I respect that.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm a big fan, Mr. Luck."
Andrew Luck,"Okay, guy, settle down."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, Mr. Andrew Luck, it's every groom's dream to catch a touchdown pass thrown by you."
Andy Dwyer,Could you do me the honor?
Andrew Luck,"Yeah, let's do it."
Andy Dwyer,Keep the spiral tight.
Andrew Luck,I'll try.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Touchdown, Dwyer!"
Ben Wyatt,Andy!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Andrew Luck,See ya!
Tom Haverford,"uh, here I go here I go here I go again"
Chris Traeger,girls what's my weakness?
Tom Haverford,let's call Ann real quick.
Tom Haverford,Rub it in.
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Tom Haverford,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,"We're having the time of our lives, and I'm calling you to rub it in!"
Chris Traeger,Whoo!
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ann Perkins,Really.
Chris Traeger,"We went to an insane bar, played football with the Colts."
Tom Haverford,With the Colts!
Andy Dwyer,The Colts!
Ben Wyatt,Football!
Chris Traeger,Now we're going to a steakhouse.
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, well, we're surrounded by hot guys."
Ben Wyatt,We're surrounded by hot guys.
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna just ripped off a stripper's underwear with her teeth."
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
April Ludgate,"Ann, who are you lying to?"
Ann Perkins,Shh.
Tom Haverford,No!
Extra,Can I take a break?
Extra,My hands are tired.
Donna Meagle,Uhuh.
Donna Meagle,We paid for an hour.
Donna Meagle,You gonna dig for an hour.
Ron Swanson,"Gentlemen, welcome to the Steak House of St. Elmo."
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ron Swanson,Tonight we eat something's flesh!
Ron Swanson,I want meat!
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, are you sure this is our table?"
Tom Haverford,There's only four settings.
Extra,"Excuse me, sir."
Extra,This is not your table.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I thought you said the Gergich party."
Extra,"No, no, I said the Gingrich party."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry."
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,But you know what?
Jerry Gergich,"Gingrich, Gergich."
Jerry Gergich,I wonder if we're related.
Newt Gingrich,"I don't think so, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Extra,"One rare porterhouse, one rare sirloin, and a rasher of bacon."
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"It's the lord's work you're doing, John."
Ron Swanson,I'd like four more glasses of Lagavulin in liquid form.
Extra,That's not something you really need to specify.
Ron Swanson,You'd be surprised.
Ben Wyatt,"So, bachelor boy, how's it going with Diane?"
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna be very candid with you all.
Ron Swanson,I like her.
Chris Traeger,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Chris Traeger,"Okay, okay, okay."
Chris Traeger,"There are so many things that I could say about Ron, but I think that the best man's speech should represent the groom."
Chris Traeger,So I will just say To Ron.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, to Ron!"
Tom Haverford,To Ron!
Ben Wyatt,To Ron.
Ron Swanson,Just perfect.
Ron Swanson,"Perfect, Chris."
Extra,"Here you are, sir."
Extra,And I thought you might also like to know that your meal has already been taken care of by Mr. Hibbert.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, whoa!"
Roy Hibbert,"What's up, Jello shot?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,Roy Hibbert.
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 reunion.
Roy Hibbert,"Hey, Tom."
Roy Hibbert,I am not paying for that guy.
Roy Hibbert,He owes me a lot of money.
Tom Haverford,It's true.
Ann Perkins,Coffee?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,"Take extra cream, 30 sugars."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I tried to exploit the Wamapoke for my own personal gain.
Ann Perkins,"Well, we got most of the artifacts, and even if we didn't, they probably won't find them."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and if they do, you'll just go to jail."
April Ludgate,"But you can make wine in your toilet and fight people, which is a super cool way to live."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Tweep.
Leslie Knope,I tweeped.
Leslie Knope,I called Tweep.
Jeremy Jamm,"Look, I'm telling the truth here, lady."
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't found any American Indian artifacts.
Jeremy Jamm,Or regular Indian.
Jeremy Jamm,"Japanese, Muslim, Jewish, none of those weird countries."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Weird countries?
Leslie Knope,Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm so glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing?
Extra,Found something!
Extra,There's other stuff too.
Extra,"Arrowheads, more pottery."
Extra,I also found some weird looking gummy candy.
Kathryn Pinewood,"All right, shut it down."
Kathryn Pinewood,This is a P.R. nightmare.
Kathryn Pinewood,We can't do anything until the Indian Affairs Commission weighs in.
Jeremy Jamm,This is [Bleep]ing bull[bleep].
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Lesie, Ken Hotate is right over there, you need to talk to him before the meeting and come clean."
Leslie Knope,He's gonna be so mad.
Leslie Knope,The zodiac killer never confessed.
Leslie Knope,Why do I have to?
April Ludgate,"Leslie, I want the Pawnee Commons as bad as you do."
April Ludgate,"Actually, that's not true."
April Ludgate,You want everything a thousand times more than I do.
April Ludgate,But we do not want to win this way.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, April, I wish you weren't right, but you are."
Leslie Knope,"You have turned into a very beautiful, wise, and fertile government employee."
April Ludgate,Stop.
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of weird when she just starts raining compliments on you, huh?"
April Ludgate,Don't try to bond with me.
Ann Perkins,Can't win.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, I had these Tshirts made."
Chris Traeger,They're not exactly a summary of the party we ended up having.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Chris Traeger,But they're a good memento.
Ron Swanson,Madness indeed.
Ben Wyatt,I love this!
Ben Wyatt,Usually you can only get board game tshirts in XXL.
Chris Traeger,I just remembered.
Chris Traeger,We left Jerry back at the gas station in Martinsville.
Chris Traeger,I'll go get him.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that guy's the best."
Tom Haverford,I feel bad he didn't get to have his moment last night.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you know what we should do for him?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get him a pet snake, but I keep it."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"In 1921, several Wamapoke families were removed from their homes so that Pawnee could install a bumper car track."
Leslie Knope,"In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal for people to, ""Dance or smell like a native American."""
Ken Hotate,Why are you telling me all this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I want to raise the bar of awfulness so that when I confess something to you, you have perspective."
Leslie Knope,Those artifacts found at lot 48 were placed there by me.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to delay construction on the Paunch Burger and buy some more time for my park project.
Ken Hotate,That is not great.
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,I have great respect for the Wamapoke culture.
Leslie Knope,And this isn't even about the Pawnee Commons.
Leslie Knope,"I just hope that you can forgive me, Ken."
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Chris Traeger,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,Congratulations.
Ben Wyatt,You have won the award for Best Man.
Tom Haverford,"Full disclosure I voted for Ryan Gosling, but you came in a close second."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've never been married, so you didn't get your own bachelor party."
Tom Haverford,But let's look ahead.
Tom Haverford,The year is 2018.
Tom Haverford,"America is thriving under president Nick Cannon, and tomorrow, Chris Traeger's getting married."
Ron Swanson,Who's the lucky lady? Maybe she's an upbeat gal who's nuts about fitness.
Jerry Gergich,Maybe she owns a juice bar in Snerling.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe it's April.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I die.
Andy Dwyer,Skydiving explosion.
Andy Dwyer,Pbbbt.
Andy Dwyer,And then you go marry April.
Andy Dwyer,"And it makes me sad, but if she's gonna be with somebody, I'd like it to be you."
Andy Dwyer,"Strange, but sweet."
Andy Dwyer,Only I didn't really die.
Andy Dwyer,I was faking it.
Andy Dwyer,And I come back.
Andy Dwyer,I spy on you from my red Corvette.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm planning to kick your ass, but I see how happy you make her, and I have to walk away."
Andy Dwyer,I have to.
Andy Dwyer,"And I do, slowly."
Andy Dwyer,In a rainstorm.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this isn't really in the spirit of what we're trying to do."
Andy Dwyer,"But as time goes by, it eats away at me."
Andy Dwyer,You're out living it up with my wife.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm alone.
Andy Dwyer,In a cave.
Andy Dwyer,Training.
Ron Swanson,Anyone else want to chime in?
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were my friend.
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were my friend!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what we're trying to say is that you are a great guy, and someday, you're gonna meet somebody who's into all the same stuff that you are."
Chris Traeger,"You know, the old Chris would've loved this super fit health goddess you guys are talking about."
Chris Traeger,"But our great adventure reminded me that now I just want someone that values the important things in life, friendships, passion, happiness."
Chris Traeger,And dimples are a plus.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that's sweet."
Andy Dwyer,"I forgive you, bro."
Andy Dwyer,You take care of April.
Ken Hotate,"After careful examination, we have determined that these Wamapoke artifacts could not have originated in lot 48."
Jeremy Jamm,Boom.
Jeremy Jamm,Knew it.
Leslie Knope,There's something else.
Leslie Knope,I would like to go on record and say that
Ken Hotate,"Hold on, Ms. Knope."
Ken Hotate,Please.
Ken Hotate,I would like to go on record.
Ken Hotate,"Speaking as a citizen of Pawnee, I do not like the way you went back on your deal with Councilwoman Knope."
Ken Hotate,"It reminds me of what the settlers of Pawnee did to my ancestors, taking their land without permission."
Leslie Knope,He really plays white people like a fiddle.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's amazing to watch.
Ken Hotate,You and Leslie had a deal.
Ken Hotate,"If that deal is not restored, well, I believe there are six Paunch Burgers in the Wamapoke casino."
Ken Hotate,Perhaps it's time that we revisited those contracts.
Kathryn Pinewood,Is that a threat?
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, I thought that was obvious."
Kathryn Pinewood,Take the sign down.
Kathryn Pinewood,We'll wait until everything's official.
Leslie Knope,"In the spirit of fair play, I suggest we put on these authentic Wamapoke headdresses and dance around the table."
Jeremy Jamm,Absolutely not.
Jeremy Jamm,That sounds highly offensive.
Ken Hotate,"Does it, white man?"
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,It's not offensive.
Jeremy Jamm,So let's do it.
Ken Hotate,You first.
Jeremy Jamm,"So clearly, this is not offensive."
Ken Hotate,It is offensive.
Jeremy Jamm,I am very sorry.
Ken Hotate,Take it off.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So I was chasing this story, but it seems like a dead end."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Then I heard about your crazy rotating bachelor party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Would you mind if I wrote about it?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,But is that really news?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,To me it is.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"A group of good friends having fun, doing nice things for each other."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I mean, that's what's important in life, and I want to write about it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger,And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Shauna's doing a story on our group bachelor party."
