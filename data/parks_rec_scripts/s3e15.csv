Leslie Knope,"Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is so nice!"
April Ludgate,"I put a poisonous gas in one of these balloons, so if any of them pops, you may die."
Andy Dwyer,"No, April, we would all die."
Andy Dwyer,Gases fill the volume of whatever container they're in.
Andy Dwyer,School.
Leslie Knope,We have activities every hour on your first day.
Leslie Knope,"10 a.m., Ann's first day waffle explosion."
Leslie Knope,11 a.m. The start paperwork jamboree.
Leslie Knope,"And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural ""D-Ann-ce Party."""
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to City Hall, cupcake!"
Ann Perkins,How many of you are in here?
Leslie Knope,There's seven.
Leslie Knope,And you have an office mate.
Leslie Knope,"His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch."
Ann Perkins,I have an office mate?
Stuart,Get these balloons out of here.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, I'm Ann."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds good.
Ben Wyatt,The meeting's at 2:00?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Conference room ""C""."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I think at some point, you and I should probably make out with each other."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
Leslie Knope,"No problems, no fights."
Leslie Knope,"Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should take separate cars to the restaurant tonight."
Ben Wyatt,Chris is deadly serious about this
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'll see you tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"By the way, I have a meeting with Marlene GriggsKnope."
Ben Wyatt,Is that any relation?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Just a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,We get it all the time.
Leslie Knope,We laugh about it.
Leslie Knope,But I've never met her.
Leslie Knope,She's Filipino.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just tell Ben she's your mother?
Leslie Knope,"Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ballbusting mother."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't think you thought this through."
Leslie Knope,You know what I should do?
Leslie Knope,"I should get my mother a oneway ticket to London, leaving today."
Leslie Knope,"And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London."
Leslie Knope,Everybody wins.
Ann Perkins,What if he sees a picture of her on your desk?
Ann Perkins,"What if Marlene says, ""Hey, have you met my daughter, Leslie?"""
Ann Perkins,"""She works in the Parks Department."""
Leslie Knope,"Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes?"
Stuart,"It's my office, too."
Leslie Knope,Stuart.
Leslie Knope,That guy was rude.
Chris Traeger,I feel that some structural changes could really unlock this department's potential.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm?
Chris Traeger,I believe you are capable of much more.
Jerry Gergich,I'm not.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,Look in the mirror.
Jerry Gergich,Huh?
Chris Traeger,"You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero."
Chris Traeger,"I'm making you head of Public Relations, which means you'll be leading the daily briefing sessions."
Ron Swanson,Excellent idea.
Ron Swanson,This is my favorite part about having a new city manager.
Ron Swanson,"They always try to shake things up, and their ideas are terrible, and it brings City Hall to a grinding halt."
Ron Swanson,"I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show."
Chris Traeger,"April, you are too valuable to just be Ron's assistant."
Chris Traeger,"So from now on, you are a multitasking executive aide, assisting the entire office."
April Ludgate,Is this a nightmare?
April Ludgate,"April, wake up."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I just wanna say that you are a wonderful employee and a terrific human being."
Tom Haverford,Meeting adjourned!
Chris Traeger,Tom.
Chris Traeger,I enjoy you.
Chris Traeger,You know what else I enjoy?
Chris Traeger,Your entrepreneurial spirit.
Tom Haverford,I did recently sell my Chronicles of Riddick DVD on eBay for $10.
Tom Haverford,Used the profits to buy the Bluray.
Chris Traeger,That's terrific.
Chris Traeger,I have an amazing project for someone of your talents.
Chris Traeger,You are going to digitize the entire city archives up on the fourth floor.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I hate the fourth floor!
Tom Haverford,"Last time I was up there, I saw someone buy crystal meth out of a vending machine."
Tom Haverford,It's a bad place.
Chris Traeger,You won't be alone.
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are nobody's shoeshine boy."
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are an administrative assistant."
Chris Traeger,For three weeks.
Chris Traeger,Then back to shoes.
Andy Dwyer,Chris!
Andy Dwyer,"I wasn't super paying attention to what you just said that we'll be doing, but I will give 110 percent. Well, as soon as you repeat yourself in a more interesting way."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing much.
Leslie Knope,"Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time."
Leslie Knope,And she's kind of a bully.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Go in there, you're gonna be great."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Ben Wyatt,I'm Mr.
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Looks like you got some shirt on your coffee.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You know what happened?
Ben Wyatt,"I spilled it, but you know how it goes."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Fun anecdote.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The county school district needs four new school buses.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I'm being stonewalled by the board, and I'm hoping your office can help us out."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Really?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, no."
Ben Wyatt,It It's probably not possible.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Then I'm confused, Ben, because you just told me it was."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Five seconds ago.
Ron Swanson,"I got a second box of donuts, if anybody-- What the [bleep] is this?"
Chris Traeger,"This, Mr. Director, is your new desk."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"This desk is the epitome of the Swedish concept of jamstalldhet, or ""equality."""
Chris Traeger,Imagine someone needs your attention.
Chris Traeger,Somebody say my name.
Jerry Gergich,Chris.
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,"What is it, Jerry?"
Jerry Gergich,You told me to say your name.
Chris Traeger,"And you did a great job, superstar."
Chris Traeger,Someone else say something.
April Ludgate,You look like a freak.
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,"April, that is not a very good attitude."
Chris Traeger,I will keep my eye on you from my circular desk where I can see everything.
Chris Traeger,Tiny swivel.
Chris Traeger,See how it works?
Ron Swanson,What about my office and its many walls?
Chris Traeger,That becomes a new public waiting room.
Chris Traeger,And we got rid of that giant pillar that was in front of your door.
Ron Swanson,I loved that pillar.
Ron Swanson,It made it really annoying to stand in my doorway.
Chris Traeger,"Well, get over it, because it's gone."
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be more accessible than ever.
Tom Haverford,The fourth floor.
Tom Haverford,"Small claims court, divorce filings, stateordered drug tests."
Tom Haverford,It's somehow both freezing and humid.
Tom Haverford,There's a whole room on the fourth floor where they store the knives they've confiscated from people who went to the fourth floor to stab someone.
Ethel Beavers,You from Parks and Rec?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Ethel Beavers,I'm here to show you around.
Andy Dwyer,"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,What's your name?
Ethel Beavers,Ethel Beavers.
Ethel Beavers,Follow me.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, this is you."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,Double computers?
Andy Dwyer,I get my own office phone.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Wall Street."
Andy Dwyer,Buy more stocks.
Andy Dwyer,Now.
Andy Dwyer,This phone kind of smells like a butt.
Ethel Beavers,Try not to move things around.
Ethel Beavers,"Because technically speaking, this is still a crime scene."
Ethel Beavers,Here's your name tags.
Ethel Beavers,Here.
Tom Haverford,"Ethel, this shirt is from Theory."
Tom Haverford,Name tags make holes.
Tom Haverford,I'm not wearing this.
Ethel Beavers,Do what you want.
Andy Dwyer,"Bye, Ethel!"
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Remind me next time to ask her where she was when Lincoln got shot.
Andy Dwyer,"""Remind Tom Ask Something."""
Andy Dwyer,"You got it, boss."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Somebody made somebody a mix!
Leslie Knope,"And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one."
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,Should we talk about how you claimed your mom was a Filipino woman you'd never met?
Leslie Knope,Should we?
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
Leslie Knope,"If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of unfun stuff."
Leslie Knope,But not yet.
Leslie Knope,I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Everything's good?
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Ben Wyatt,I was completely flustered.
Ben Wyatt,I came off like an idiot.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I loved him!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He's a total pushover.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Very odd guy, though."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"He's like a goofy, spineless jellyfish."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Why do you ask, sweetheart?"
Leslie Knope,No reason.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,It's totally fine.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not fine."
Ben Wyatt,What if she starts going around telling people I'm a pushover?
Leslie Knope,No one's gonna believe that.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hardass."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"A cute fascist hardass, but still, you give off a very--"
Extra,Education Department now officially requesting 10 school buses.
Leslie Knope,I thought they only wanted four.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, now that I'm a pushover, why not ask for 10, or 20, or 100 new school buses and a fleet of school yachts?"
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Ben Wyatt,Here's what we're gonna do.
Ben Wyatt,You are gonna tell me everything there is to know about your mom.
Ben Wyatt,"And I'm gonna have another meeting with her, and we're gonna have it out."
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,And we could look at the whale sharks.
Leslie Knope,"You're certified, right?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get you certified.
Jerry Gergich,"April, do you have that usage report that I asked for?"
April Ludgate,"Anything for you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Jerry Gergich,Why?
Gretel,Excuse me.
Gretel,"There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says ""Do not drink the sprinkler water,"" so I made sun tea with it, and now I have an infection."
Gretel,Sir?
Gretel,"Sir, are Are you listening to me, sir?"
Gretel,"Sir, I'm talking to you!"
Gretel,Sir!
Gretel,"Sir, are you aware that there is waste in your water system?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive."
Leslie Knope,This is not a meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's a battle.
Leslie Knope,Normal meeting rules do not apply.
Leslie Knope,"I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go!
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,No preambles.
Leslie Knope,No introductions.
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and start talking.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to discuss the new school bus.
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr. Seuss."
Leslie Knope,And you should be sitting by now.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and take a seat.
Ben Wyatt,Um.
Leslie Knope,"""Um"" is the sound in ""dumb."""
Leslie Knope,That's what she says to people.
Leslie Knope,And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
Ben Wyatt,God!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, should we just start over?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we need to put a pin in this."
Leslie Knope,"Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig."
Leslie Knope,You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Ben Wyatt,"Deliverance, the movie?"
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,"So Jerry is, like, basically my boss now, which I'm never gonna work for him."
April Ludgate,"Ron's trapped in this weird desk prison, and I now work at this traveling IV station."
Extra,This Mort Jansen's office?
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Extra,"Tell Mort I said ""Your move."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I wanna work up here with you guys.
April Ludgate,This is awesome.
Tom Haverford,How many more of those stupid documents do you have to scan?
Andy Dwyer,"Just this one, and all the ones in those boxes."
Tom Haverford,I gotta get out of here pronto.
Tom Haverford,Time to get those old ladies to do my work for me.
Tom Haverford,How?
Tom Haverford,By shining down on them with the Haverford charm ray.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Ethel Beavers.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, beautiful?"
Tom Haverford,Julianne Moore just called.
Tom Haverford,She wants her hair back.
Ethel Beavers,Nobody named Julien called.
Tom Haverford,Never mind.
Tom Haverford,I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
Tom Haverford,"One, can you help me out with this project we're doing?"
Tom Haverford,"And, two, will you please invite me to your 30th birthday party?"
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Ethel Beavers,I'm making a test call to your phone to make sure it's working so you don't miss any more calls.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,Don't bother.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll just find an open window and plummet to my death.
Ethel Beavers,Okay.
Donna Meagle,This isn't gonna work.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, you did not just swivel away while I was talking to you."
Donna Meagle,This spaceship keyboard is driving me crazy.
Donna Meagle,"I'm down to one word a minute, and the word is ""perflipisklup"" because I can't fly spaceships."
Ron Swanson,"Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out."
Ron Swanson,You just have to wait.
Donna Meagle,Usually I'm with you.
Donna Meagle,"But this is Chris Traeger, the six million dollar man."
Donna Meagle,He won't quit.
Donna Meagle,So you need to swivel your ass down to his office and have a word with him.
Leslie Knope,Mommy.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That is so thoughtful of you.
Leslie Knope,Of course!
Leslie Knope,"I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, it's my understanding that despite what I said in our meeting, you have somehow increased your request for more school buses."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we could do this another time.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're gonna talk about this now."
Ben Wyatt,"Or if you'd prefer, I could put a permanent freeze on the education budget."
Ben Wyatt,It's your call.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He seems pretty self-assured.
Extra,There's nothing left.
Extra,It's over.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, hey, hey, don't say that."
Chris Traeger,"Now, come on."
Chris Traeger,Get yourself together and go out there and be the woman you always knew you could be.
Extra,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,Who was that?
Chris Traeger,I don't know.
Chris Traeger,"I saw her crying, and so I helped."
Chris Traeger,What did you wanna talk to me about?
Tom Haverford,"Look, Chris, I'm very flattered you thought of me for this amazing opportunity, but I don't really know if this gig is in my wheelhouse."
Tom Haverford,"I tend to work best with young, attractive people."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have made you a project leader."
Chris Traeger,This is a big deal!
Chris Traeger,You should keep an open mind.
Chris Traeger,Let your brain unlock the door to your heart's future.
Chris Traeger,I made that expression up when I was 14.
Chris Traeger,Still in use today.
Chris Traeger,By me.
Chris Traeger,Gotta jam.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's just not possible.
Ben Wyatt,"And don't even bother trying to outflank me either, because you will fail."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on."
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Marlene.
Ben Wyatt,There's probably a compromise here.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Compromise is usually a sign of weakness.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is, according to Andrew Carnegie."
Ben Wyatt,"But your demands remind me of a different quote, from the great Bill Watterson."
Ben Wyatt,"""You need a lobotomy."""
Ben Wyatt,"""I'll get a saw."""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I love Calvin and Hobbes.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, this is some of my best work."
Leslie Knope,This could not have gone better.
Leslie Knope,They are really hitting it off.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,Crisis averted.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, I am very glad you came back up here."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me too."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So you have a deal.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, let me mull everything over, and then we can reconnect and hash things out."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"It might get rough, but that can be fun."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Ben can handle it.
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I can."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It was a pleasure.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you could tell instantly."
Leslie Knope,The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house"
Ethel Beavers,You two are just the cutest things on four legs!
Extra,But why so much black?
Extra,It's like you're going to a funeral.
Andy Dwyer,"She's got a point, babe."
April Ludgate,"So, marry her then."
Extra,I wish!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sorry to interrupt the love fest, but can you hand me that folder there, please, Ethel?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, great."
Tom Haverford,"Why you gotta be like that, Ethel?"
Ethel Beavers,Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the crib.
Tom Haverford,"Stop laughing, Muriel."
Tom Haverford,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, I'm a genius."
Leslie Knope,The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made her a McSteamystyle music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her."
Leslie Knope,She would love you for it.
Ben Wyatt,I think maybe that's not such a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but--"
Ben Wyatt,"Your mom kind of, um, made a pass at me."
Jerry Gergich,"So, Webster's dictionary describes a pork as a --No, it's park. Park."
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, okay."
Jerry Gergich,"So-- You know what, can we start over?"
Jerry Gergich,Let's-- Let's go from the first thing.
Jerry Gergich,"I said, pork, which By the way, they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today."
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Chris.
Ron Swanson,You have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Chris Traeger,"Now, wait a minute."
Ron Swanson,I mean that as a compliment.
Ron Swanson,"So, it pains me to say this."
Ron Swanson,My department has to go back to the way it was.
Chris Traeger,Give them time.
Chris Traeger,They'll adjust.
Ron Swanson,"No, they won't."
Ron Swanson,They're miserable.
Ron Swanson,"Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on Freak Island isn't helping anyone."
Ron Swanson,And you made April assistant to everyone? You know who April hates? Everyone.
Ron Swanson,And Jerry can only function if no one's looking.
Ron Swanson,"You shine a light on him, and he shrinks up faster than an Eskimo's scrotum."
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's very perceptive, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"And, very graphic."
Chris Traeger,"I understand your point, but there's no way that I can just roll over on this."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"You won't ever hear me say this again, so savor this moment."
Ron Swanson,I may have a compromise.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she was just flirting a little."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure she's not really interested in me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't even have this conversation.
Leslie Knope,The whole thing is screwed up now.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way?"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Leslie Knope,How were you dressed?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,I was wearing this.
Leslie Knope,Here's what we do.
Leslie Knope,"You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico."
Leslie Knope,Just for a couple of weeks.
Leslie Knope,Where are you going? Ben! Ben! Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Just-- Hey-- Hi, Mom."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hi again.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie and I are dating.
Ben Wyatt,We haven't told anyone because there's a rule against office relationships.
Ben Wyatt,But it's happening.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry we didn't tell you before you touched my knee, and I trust you won't tell anyone now since it could get your daughter fired."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That is hilarious.
Leslie Knope,"That's what we thought, too."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Well Four buses.
Ben Wyatt,Two.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Deal.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I like this one.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,You keep your hands off him.
Andy Dwyer,Margaret's pecan squares.
Andy Dwyer,They are like crack.
Andy Dwyer,I brought you one.
Tom Haverford,How are you so happy working here?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, man."
Andy Dwyer,It's not that bad.
Andy Dwyer,"A year ago, I lived in a pit."
Andy Dwyer,"Now I got a job, and a kickass wife."
Andy Dwyer,"And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square? When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
Andy Dwyer,I read that once on a can of lemonade.
Andy Dwyer,But I like to think that it applies to life.
Tom Haverford,I don't want lemonade.
Tom Haverford,It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.
Tom Haverford,So maybe it's time for a change.
Tom Haverford,"Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls."
Donna Meagle,Here you go.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you know how new city managers are."
Leslie Knope,Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
Leslie Knope,How long do you have to do this?
Ron Swanson,A week.
Leslie Knope,Citizen request.
Leslie Knope,"Swivel, swivel, swivel."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"I can help you in here, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, you're really screwing this up."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gone for one day and this entire shoe shine stand falls apart.
Andy Dwyer,Everything I built.
Andy Dwyer,Jump up here.
Andy Dwyer,I'll show you how it's done.
Andy Dwyer,"See, your problem is you're thinking too much."
Extra,Wow.
Extra,You're really good at this.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,I am.
Andy Dwyer,"When I come back here in a few weeks, I don't want all my regular customers to not be here waiting for me because somebody screwed it up."
Andy Dwyer,Huh? Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,No problem.
Andy Dwyer,"See you later, kid."
Extra,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,What a moron.
