Leslie Knope,"So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School."
Leslie Knope,Attendance has been low.
Leslie Knope,"And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh."
Leslie Knope,You can form like a Trans-Asiatic alliance.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I like it."
Ben Wyatt,And I see the merits of it.
Ben Wyatt,"I just worry if we're both in Asia, it might limit our scope."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,I kinda want to roll up my sleeves and make geopolitical problem solving my bitch.
Leslie Knope,"Amen, brother."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go back to plan ""A."""
Leslie Knope,"I'll be Denmark, you be Peru."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I didn't really do Model United Nations in high school, so Oh, wait."
Ben Wyatt,I super did.
Leslie Knope,I need a few more volunteers.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, will you be Iceland?"
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2?
Andy Dwyer,Don't think so.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how about Japan?"
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Karate Kid 2?
Andy Dwyer,Even worse.
Andy Dwyer,How 'bout Germany?
Andy Dwyer,They've never been the bad guys.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you be Finland?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.

Leslie Knope,"No, you're gonna be South Africa or Pakistan."
April Ludgate,"I'm the Moon, or I quit."
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,"Moon or quit, man."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon."
April Ludgate,The Moon accepts your ridiculous proposal.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,You wanna join us?
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,I'll let you be America.
Ron Swanson,And teach kids that not only is government good but that there should be a Worldwide super government?
Ron Swanson,I'd rather sand down my toenails.
Ron Swanson,"Every three weeks, I have to sand down my toenails."
Ron Swanson,They're too strong for clippers.
Allison,Excuse me.
Allison,Are you Leslie Knope?
Allison,"Oh, what am I talking about?"
Allison,Of course you are.
Leslie Knope,"Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur."
Allison,Thank you so much for coming and trying to help save our club.
Allison,We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model UN legend in action.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model UN legend.
Leslie Knope,I'd go with icon.
Leslie Knope,Or hero.
Tom Haverford,"Look, if you ask me, Enron is down but not out."
Tom Haverford,Who doesn't like a comeback story?
Tom Haverford,"All right, you wanna hear my plan, get at me later."
Tom Haverford,I gotta meet up with an old friend.
Tom Haverford,"All right, peace, man."
Tom Haverford,Let's go do this lunch thing.
Ron Swanson,I just have one more quick interview.
Ron Swanson,I'm still trying to find your replacement.
Ron Swanson,"That is, unless you want your old job back."
Tom Haverford,"I told you before, Ronseph, I moved on to bigger things."
Tom Haverford,E720 going under was a blessing.
Tom Haverford,I'm tearing it up all over town like a boss.
Ron Swanson,"Sounds great, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,"I've offered Tom his job back several times, and each time he's told me he's just too busy being an entrepreneur."
Ron Swanson,"Then two days ago, I saw him spraying cologne samples at Macy's."
Ron Swanson,The young man has a lot of pride.
Ron Swanson,This isn't gonna be easy.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris, how's it going?"
Chris Traeger,Not good.
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but I am romantically involved with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly hot daughter Millicent Gergich."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You were grinding with her pretty hard at April's Halloween party.
Chris Traeger,That's correct.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, we've been on four dates, but now Millicent Gergich hasn't returned my last two phone calls."
Chris Traeger,"I think the relationship may be in trouble, and I don't know why."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,A four date long relationship might not be 100% perfect?
Ann Perkins,I think you should launch a fullscale investigation.
Chris Traeger,"The root of sarcasm is truth, Ann."
Chris Traeger,I am going to launch a fullscale investigation.
Chris Traeger,And I sincerely thank you for that suggestion.
Ann Perkins,Glad I could help in these trying times.
Chris Traeger,Sarcasm again!
Chris Traeger,You're a delight.
Leslie Knope,You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Leslie Knope,"Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death."
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, have fun."
Leslie Knope,"Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over."
Leslie Knope,And I'm totally fine with that.
Leslie Knope,But Ben and I have so much in common.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're amazing friends."
Leslie Knope,And friendship is better because friends help you move.
Leslie Knope,They drive you to the airport.
Leslie Knope,Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Chris Traeger,Jerry!
Chris Traeger,"I am launching a fullscale investigation into my romantic relationship with your daughter Millicent Gergich, and I thought I could pick your brain."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez, I really shouldn't be involved in something"
Chris Traeger,Quick recap things were going wonderfully.
Chris Traeger,We clicked on an emotional level.
Chris Traeger,"And then suddenly, I just stopped hearing from her."
Chris Traeger,"Now, you must know her pretty well what gives?"
Donna Meagle,Here's what I saw go down.
Chris Traeger,Donna!
Chris Traeger,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,Get in on this.
Donna Meagle,You're too accessible.
Donna Meagle,"Every time she calls, you answer."
Donna Meagle,"You gotta dangle the carrot, literally and metaphorically."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Donna!"
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, Donna."
Ron Swanson,So Courtney.
Ron Swanson,This says you retired in 1968.
Extra,"No, no, no."
Extra,I was fired because I made a pass at an ethnic woman.
Tom Haverford,And what have you been doing for the last 43 years?
Extra,"Oh, you know, hitchhiking around."
Extra,I went to Mexico.
Extra,I met a lot of ethnic girls.
Extra,They grow on trees down there.
Extra,I was in jail for a spell That about brings it up to date.
Ron Swanson,"Sounds to me like you're ready to get back in the game, Courtney."
Ron Swanson,We'll be in touch.
Ron Swanson,Another very strong candidate.
Tom Haverford,Are you insane?
Tom Haverford,He was a million year old racist!
Ron Swanson,"He said he liked ethnic girls, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, Ron, but I created a legacy here, and I need to make sure it's protected."
Tom Haverford,Let's bring in some more people.
Tom Haverford,"In my four years here, I revolutionized the position of administrator and made this place cool."
Tom Haverford,I was the first person to abbreviate Parks and Recreation Department.
Tom Haverford,First it was Parks and Recreation.
Tom Haverford,Then Parks and Rec.
Tom Haverford,Then P&R.
Tom Haverford,Then lengthened it just a little bit to Tommy's place.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait a minute."
Leslie Knope,I think I have it.
Leslie Knope,What if we dropped interest rates.
Leslie Knope,Would that help you?
Ben Wyatt,Maybe.
Ben Wyatt,But what if Brazil and Argentina use their oil deposits as collateral?
Allison,"Oh, that's really good."
Leslie Knope,"Underexaggerate much, France?"
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha!
Ben Wyatt,Nice!
William Barnes,"Hey, Leslie, you ready?"
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, William."
William Barnes,Hi.
William Barnes,You ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Um They want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
Leslie Knope,Can we just press pause here?
Ben Wyatt,How long is it gonna take?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really sure.
Leslie Knope,Can you just tread water until I'm ready?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, sure, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,I'll just tread water until you're ready.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and I aren't dating anymore, but, uh, we're friends."
Ben Wyatt,So it's fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's just fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's fun it's fun It is fun.
Andy Dwyer,Thanks a lot.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Honey!
Andy Dwyer,I just traded Finland's military to Kenya for 50 lions.
Andy Dwyer,"That's pretty good, right?"
April Ludgate,Yeah
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,But also militaries are pretty good at protecting countries.
Andy Dwyer,But so are lions.
Andy Dwyer,And you don't have to pay them.
Andy Dwyer,These kids are idiots.
Andy Dwyer,I've just traded all of Finland's boring stuff for every other country's lions?
Andy Dwyer,I definitely have more lions than any other country in the whole world right now.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea what's going on.
Andy Dwyer,"But if that ends up meaning something in this game, I'd say I'm set."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so Russia and China are about to propose their own plan, so the kids kinda want to get ours out there."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes."
William Barnes,Let's say 10 or 15 to be safe.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about me make it a cool 40?"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's just important.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is important too."
Ben Wyatt,It's kinda why we came here.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, could you Just step over here?"
William Barnes,You're in the shot.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, of course."
Extra,Her life is so awesome.
Extra,You're lucky you're friends with her.
Ben Wyatt,"Shut up, Bulgaria!"
Ben Wyatt,"I know, well, that's the great thing about treaties, It doesn't even matter."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'm back.
Leslie Knope,"Or, as they say in Denmark ""I'm back."""
Leslie Knope,Most people speak English.
Leslie Knope,So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh actually, I merged our treaty with Russia and China's treaty."
Leslie Knope,I got cut out of my own treaty?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I got sick of treading water, so I swam over to Asia, made a deal."
Leslie Knope,The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Leslie Knope,Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
Leslie Knope,I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, just look I thought I could handle being friends with you."
Ben Wyatt,"But I can't, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together."
Ben Wyatt,I think that was the right call.
Leslie Knope,But that was in a romantic way.
Leslie Knope,We can still spend time together as friends.
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't work that way.
Ben Wyatt,You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,Because it's selfish.
Ben Wyatt,Stop being obtuse.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I understand where he's coming from."
Leslie Knope,"But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?"
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,That leaves me with only one option.
Leslie Knope,Just excuse me for a
Leslie Knope,Attention.
Leslie Knope,This is an urgent world matter.
Leslie Knope,"Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru."
Leslie Knope,"Scandinavian brothers, on my signal."
Leslie Knope,Unleash hell!
Chris Traeger,"See, I just don't believe in this whole don't let people know how you feel nonsense."
Chris Traeger,I love telling people how I feel.
Chris Traeger,Mostly because I love most people.
Chris Traeger,And I love telling them that I love them.
Donna Meagle,"You didn't tell that girl you love her, did you?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I'm not crazy.
Ann Perkins,What is this urgent meeting with Donna and Jerry?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I took your advice.
Ann Perkins,My sarcastic advice.
Chris Traeger,Precisely.
Chris Traeger,"And we're getting to the bottom of what's going on with me and Jerry's daughter, and I thought you would be a tremendous addition to this think tank."
Ann Perkins,This is incredibly inappropriate.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you!"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm game."
Extra,No.
Extra,I'm not kidding.
Extra,"My name's Gary, and I'm from Gary, Indiana."
Ron Swanson,Amazing.
Extra,People like hearing that.
Extra,It's probably one of my stronger anecdotes.
Tom Haverford,"A fact is not an anecdote, Gary."
Tom Haverford,Here's an anecdote Today I met the most boring man in the world.
Tom Haverford,His name was Gary.
Extra,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,Now Keith.
Ron Swanson,"Under sex, you wrote ""Yes."""
Ron Swanson,"Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha."
Ron Swanson,Well played.
Extra,Thank you.
Extra,"Ah, but all jokes aside."
Extra,I'm a boy.
Tom Haverford,"Keith, I had this job for four years."
Tom Haverford,"And I can tell you, you get out of it what you put into it."
Tom Haverford,What are you hoping to get out of it?
Extra,In like a month or so.
Tom Haverford,What?
Extra,Oh What!
Extra,What am I hoping to get out of this job?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,Like one one month of money... Would be would be just right.
Tom Haverford,Let me give you a situation.
Tom Haverford,You're hosting a town hall meeting for local businesses.
Extra,Uh That's so much stuff.
Extra,"You just, uh kept on going."
Tom Haverford,That was like one thing.
Tom Haverford,I didn't even get to the situation yet.
Extra,Oh!
Extra,All right.
Extra,"Well, thanks, guys."
Extra,I think we've all seen enough.
Extra,Still not totally sure what I'm applying for.
Extra,"But if you ask me, I think it went pretty well."
Leslie Knope,"What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there."
Allison,"Madame Ambassador, are you changing the scenario?"
Allison,We didn't prepare for this.
Leslie Knope,"Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, ""wait, I thought this one thing, but look over there."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's a different thing, and it's changing everything,"" and I'm like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Hold up."""
Leslie Knope,Who has tanks for me?
Extra,"I'm sorry, but... We're gonna keep trying to solve the food crisis."
Leslie Knope,Food schmood.
Leslie Knope,This is war.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe."
Andy Dwyer,"Say the word, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'll sick my army of lions on him.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, I think, um Things are starting to get a little out of control here."
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,"You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay."
Ben Wyatt,I need to I need to pay.
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,You might wanna borrow this.
April Ludgate,"Ew, no one wants your dirty underwear, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,It's not dirty underwear.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a white flag, and you may as well start waving it right now"
Leslie Knope,the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Tom Haverford,"They were duds, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Really, anything would be better than the people we interviewed today."
Ron Swanson,"I guess you're right, Tom."
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna find another you.
Ron Swanson,You were perfect.
Ron Swanson,"Competent enough to keep the bosses off my back, but selfish enough to slow down all the work."
Ron Swanson,Tom Haverfords don't grow on trees.
Tom Haverford,"If they did, I'd sell 'em."
Tom Haverford,Tommy trees.
Ron Swanson,Would you consider coming back?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ron."
Tom Haverford,No can do.
Tom Haverford,I'm like a shark.
Tom Haverford,I don't swim backwards.
Tom Haverford,"See ya later, man."
Allison,We've been making great strides with genetically modified crops and would gladly pledge to continue the growth of--
Ben Wyatt,"excuse me, Madame Ambassador."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Allison,I'm not finished.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Then why do I have the microphone?
Ben Wyatt,I move that the Security Council formally condemn Denmark and stop them from making any more unwarranted acts of aggression.
Extra,As long as you quit derailing the conference.
Extra,People are dying of hunger in Africa.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cry me a river."
Ben Wyatt,All in favor of the resolution.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,The resolution passes with flying colors.
Ben Wyatt,Denmark is formally condemned.
Ben Wyatt,Bam!
Leslie Knope,"That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs."
Leslie Knope,And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing?"
April Ludgate,The Moon shall join your coalition.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,We got the freaking moon.
Leslie Knope,"What are you gonna do without tides, Peru?"
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,We need to stop dealing in hypotheticals.
Chris Traeger,"Ann, we dated."
Chris Traeger,What happened to us?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna get real?
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Chris Traeger,Sounds like fun.
Ann Perkins,Sometimes your relentless cheeriness is confusing.
Ann Perkins,Like that time we went to Eagleton and we got that hotel room with the jacuzzi
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this just got real good!"
Ann Perkins,And the jacuzzi broke.
Chris Traeger,But I did eat food off of your body.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Donna Meagle,"All right, Chris and Ann!"
Jerry Gergich,I just wanna go back to work.
Leslie Knope,"So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon."
Andy Dwyer,The big three.
Leslie Knope,"Now, here's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
Leslie Knope,"While he does that, we are gonna make sure--"
Allison,Attention!
Allison,The Security Council has decided to expel Peru and Denmark from the United Nations.
Leslie Knope,Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi?
Allison,'Cause you guys suck.
Allison,Look around.
Allison,We thought you were gonna teach us how to solve problems.
Allison,You've ruined my favorite club.
Allison,Thanks a lot.
Andy Dwyer,Did we win?
Andy Dwyer,I think we won!
Andy Dwyer,What were we trying to do?
Andy Dwyer,I learned so much today.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I thought it was really cool how everything fell apart in there.
April Ludgate,"And also, maybe you should talk to Ben."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,"When Ben gets upset, he becomes a really bad roommate."
April Ludgate,He takes really long sadness baths and makes me late for stuff.
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,Can't wait to graduate.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but summer's gonna totally kick ass."
Chris Traeger,So you're saying that I intimidated you?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Not exactly.
Donna Meagle,Come on.
Donna Meagle,Talk more about that tantric workshop y'all went to.
Ann Perkins,"I was so into you, okay, and you basically turned me into a female version of yourself, and then you got bored dating me because you were dating yourself."
Ann Perkins,"Huh I mean, I was jogging."
Ann Perkins,I hate jogging.
Chris Traeger,Jogging's amazing!
Ann Perkins,"Jogging is the worst, Chris."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm sorry that I added five years to your life."
Chris Traeger,Now I'm being sarcastic.
Chris Traeger,Like you.
Chris Traeger,I'm doing something that you like.
Ann Perkins,"Being with you definitely made me do a lot of soul searching, and I came out the other side being a much more selfpossessed person."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm glad."
Ann Perkins,Good luck with Millicent.
Ann Perkins,Just back off a little bit.
Ann Perkins,Let her be herself.
Ann Perkins,Everything'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe."
Ben Wyatt,That's That's not true.
Andy Dwyer,Well You have to rearrange them.
Andy Dwyer,Oh Delegates!
Andy Dwyer,I know that you're angry with each other.
Andy Dwyer,"Hopefully, this will be your opportunity to have your very own Camp David."
Andy Dwyer,"In high school, my buddy David Fundis would have these campouts in his backyard."
Andy Dwyer,"We would just chill out, have a bonfire, talk about whatever was on our mind."
Andy Dwyer,We called it camp David.
Ben Wyatt,How do you know about Camp David?
Andy Dwyer,How do you know about camp David?
April Ludgate,okay.
April Ludgate,"You guys are being stupid, so why don't you work it out while Andy and I"
Andy Dwyer,Throw these scientist bottles off the roof?
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,See ya.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Go.
Leslie Knope,"It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle."
Ben Wyatt,I was perhaps a little icier than I needed to be.
Leslie Knope,I just need you to be in my life.
Leslie Knope,You're too important to me.
Ben Wyatt,I wish I could say it's possible.
Ben Wyatt,I just I don't know if it is right now.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes."
Ben Wyatt,I'll take it to the Peruvian senate.
Ben Wyatt,Or whatever.
Leslie Knope,Please do that.
Ben Wyatt,I'll try.
Ben Wyatt,I'll see what they say.
Leslie Knope,What do we do with those kids? We totally ruined their club.
Ben Wyatt,I could tell you what I would like when I was their age.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I regret telling you that very much.
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,I gotta come clean.
Ron Swanson,I saw you spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
Tom Haverford,What? Macy's? That wasn't me.
Tom Haverford,There's a Macy's in town? Where's the Macy's in town? I heard they have an amazing cologne sample guy.
Ron Swanson,"Just take the job, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,Come on back.
Tom Haverford,I quit to peruse my dream.
Tom Haverford,And my dream collapsed.
Tom Haverford,"It's embarrassing, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I can't go from a CEO back to being an administrator.
Ron Swanson,Is there anything I can do to make you feel okay about coming back?
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, please Help me."
Ron Swanson,I'm trying to get Tom back.
Ron Swanson,I'm begging.
Ron Swanson,This department just doesn't work without you.
Ron Swanson,What do you say?
Tom Haverford,"Ron, this is embarrassing."
Tom Haverford,Even for you.
Tom Haverford,I'm not coming back.
Tom Haverford,"Peace out, my dudes."
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, everyone."
Tom Haverford,That was great.
Tom Haverford,"So what I'm thinking is I'll come back in a few days, you'll beg me again aah! So if it's okay with you guys, I would like to ask Ron for my job back."
Tom Haverford,"Ron May I have my job back, please? Thank you."
Tom Haverford,I will see you all Monday.
Ron Swanson,Looking forward to it.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, France, bienvenue."
Allison,"My name is Cassidy, and I'm really annoyed with you."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that."
Allison,"What? Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee City Council chambers.
Leslie Knope,The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,Sit down.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie and I feel terrible for war breaking out at your Model U.N
Leslie Knope,"Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.N."
Leslie Knope,"In this room, and you're gonna run the show."
Allison,What?
Leslie Knope,And we will just be not here.
Leslie Knope,Or taking some small countries.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Not here.
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Allison,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Those kids are passionate about something.
Leslie Knope,That's important.
Leslie Knope,"That's all there is, really, is passion."
Leslie Knope,Passion is what makes for good treaties Good relationships Good pizza.
Leslie Knope,Good friends.
Leslie Knope,Good everything.
Leslie Knope,Including wars.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and Gentlemen, ""He was gone but never forgotten."""
Leslie Knope,"""He makes all the ladies want--"" No, I'm not gonna say that."
Leslie Knope,"""Swagger beats and I get the-- Who's the"" All right, forget it."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Tom Haverford!"
Tom Haverford,"Tick-tock, it's Tommy time!"
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, I have to object again."
Jerry Gergich,This just seems unfair.
Leslie Knope,"I understand that, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, but I can't even hear anything because of the noise from the copier."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,These are really important.
