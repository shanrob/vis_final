Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Morning.
Ron Swanson,"I know how much you enjoy paperwork, but don't hover."
Leslie Knope,Nice bench.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's been there since the '90s."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,I never Aha!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is."
Leslie Knope,Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday."
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,I was so careful.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it."
Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Was it?
Ron Swanson,I command you to do nothing.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.
Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.
Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.
Ron Swanson,"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, the whole thing is a scam."
Ron Swanson,Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
Tom Haverford,They put up a fence.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No!
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--"
Tom Haverford,Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.
Tom Haverford,There's even a security guard.
Tom Haverford,You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.
Donna Meagle,Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.
Donna Meagle,And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.
Donna Meagle,With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.
Ben Wyatt,Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?
Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else."
Leslie Knope,What was it again?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Her soul.
Ben Wyatt,Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?
Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.
April Ludgate,That's what people always say when something sucks.
Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier."
Tom Haverford,People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.
Tom Haverford,I would never set foot over there.
Tom Haverford,"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."""
April Ludgate,I am all over it.
Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.
Ron Swanson,But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
Extra,It's the only park in our neighborhood.
Extra,"I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?"
Extra,There's rocks in there.
Extra,Why don't we just set fire to the fence?
Extra,"You know, set it ablaze."
Leslie Knope,That's arson.
Extra,"Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers."
Extra,"The point is, it would work."
Extra,Why don't we build a fence around their fence?
Extra,Why?
Extra,"It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught."
Extra,"My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm."
Extra,You need to get those people to tear that fence down.
Leslie Knope,This woman's right.
Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence."
Extra,"Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down."
Extra,But whatever you guys think.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Great.
April Ludgate,"Yes, hi."
April Ludgate,I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.
April Ludgate,Do those come in different sizes?
April Ludgate,I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.
April Ludgate,"Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?"
April Ludgate,That was rude.
Ron Swanson,"Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately."
April Ludgate,I was just talking on the phone.
Ron Swanson,To whom?
April Ludgate,It was personal.
April Ludgate,I would never make a workrelated call.
April Ludgate,You know that.
Leslie Knope,Lindsay!
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hi.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Has it really been five years?
Leslie Knope,It has.
Leslie Knope,You look amazing.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thank you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This place hasn't changed a bit.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Still loveable, but grimy."
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, there."
Ben Wyatt,I'm Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,I'm assistant city manager
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hi, Dan."
Ben Wyatt,Ben.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not important.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It won't come up again.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann.
Leslie Knope,She is my best friend.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,"And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm sorry.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"It's just, nursing... You must be so tired and sad."
Leslie Knope,It's really nice outside.
Leslie Knope,Shall we speak in my courtyard?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was passing through Pawnee anyway.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do a lot of charity work here.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,There's only so much you can do.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Look at that.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Let me get a closer look.
Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Oh, yes."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm only trying to protect our children.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you."
Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone."
Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You know what's really great?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,A private park that's not for everyone.
Leslie Knope,Wowsers.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What do you care?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's just a crappy little park.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.
Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.
Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.
Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence stays up.
Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,But it was good seeing you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.
Leslie Knope,I'm awake.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you."
Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,This is where they have their public forums?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great."
Tom Haverford,They had a valet.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.
Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income."
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.
Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hello, Pawnee."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Welcome to our public forum.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, nice outfit."
Leslie Knope,"What, did you just come from the stables?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yes.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was just at the stables.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You look like you've been working hard.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You have a million flyaways right now.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book?
Leslie Knope,I would not.
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,Pun intended.
Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The forum is beginning.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Tom Haverford,Look how pretty the people are.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ron."
April Ludgate,How's the street parking at your house?
Ron Swanson,What?
April Ludgate,"Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a double decker party bus?"
Ron Swanson,There is no street parking at my house.
April Ludgate,My house is not even on a street.
April Ludgate,"Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent?"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron."
Ann Perkins,Have you seen
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ron Swanson,"Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy."
Ann Perkins,These were for a sick child at the hospital.
Ron Swanson,"My office, now."
Ann Perkins,I don't work for you.
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Tom Haverford,"Decisions, decisions."
Tom Haverford,"I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plait."
Leslie Knope,that the EagletonPawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Bertram Rolands,Hello.
Bertram Rolands,"I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton."
Bertram Rolands,"With all due respect, Ms. Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now."
Christine Porter,Hello.
Christine Porter,I'm Christine Porter.
Christine Porter,I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.
Christine Porter,I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett."
Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence."
Joey Plunkett,I can wave with this arm.
Leslie Knope,"No, you can't."
Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.
Extra,"All due respect, I recognize that boy."
Extra,He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.
Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town."
Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thanks to Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I'm not done.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Isn't she trying her hardest?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,So cute and so good.
Ron Swanson,I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Ron Swanson,What is going on with my birthday?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's your birthday."
Ann Perkins,Happy Birthday.
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ann Perkins,This is a fun conversation.
Ron Swanson,Just tell me what Leslie is planning.
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,I haven't heard anything.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, that was intense."
Ann Perkins,She totally surprised me.
Ann Perkins,"She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Senor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out."
Ann Perkins,"They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings ""Happy Birthday""?"
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ann Perkins,"And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger."
Ron Swanson,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming."
Ann Perkins,And then there was a bouncy castle.
Ann Perkins,Did you know they made those for adults?
Ron Swanson,Mmmhmm.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Tom Haverford,Can I try the andouille sausage?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, let's go."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, not you too."
Ben Wyatt,It's gross.
Ben Wyatt,I don't like it.
Ben Wyatt,It's disgusting.
Tom Haverford,Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?
Tom Haverford,There's an iPod touch in here.
Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway?"
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job."
Tom Haverford,And you said no? Are you insane?
Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live."
Leslie Knope,"And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Tom Haverford,Verbena-scented soy candles!
Chris Traeger,"You want me to do what, now?"
Ron Swanson,"Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts."
Chris Traeger,I don't understand.
Chris Traeger,Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?
Ron Swanson,"No, it has nothing to do with her work."
Ron Swanson,I don't want to get into it.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, look, this is me, okay? You know you can talk to me about anything."
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's my birthday on Friday."
Chris Traeger,Hey! Happy Birthday.
Ron Swanson,I'm ending this right now.
Ron Swanson,I'm just gonna leave early and go home.
Ron Swanson,Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Eagleton treats us like garbage.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna treat them like garbage.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park."
Leslie Knope,And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.
Leslie Knope,Put everything back in the truck.
Leslie Knope,Let's back it up.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, you promised we could throw garbage everywhere."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Wow.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town."
Leslie Knope,"I am so sick of this, Lindsay."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,I've got this.
Tom Haverford,"You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em."
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man."
Tom Haverford,"No! I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am! So here's what you could do, lady."
Tom Haverford,Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah! Shove it there!"
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget."
Leslie Knope,You're a Pawnee girl.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"No, Leslie, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J's Diner?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not for me.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,These waffles make great dog laxatives.
Leslie Knope,Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Sambuca need to make? There you go.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,How dare you? No!
Andy Dwyer,"Get her, Leslie!"
Andy Dwyer,Garbage fight!
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,I want her arrested for attempted murder.
Chief Trumple,"For God's sake Knope, get a grip."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Thank God you're here, I want her arrested, she attacked me and then she hurled my Kate Spade headband somewhere."
Chief Trumple,"I think my Eagleton colleagues would agree that we don't want to make a federal case out of this, so I suggest you both apologize to each never and we can pretend this never happened."
Leslie Knope,I will never apologize to her.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,I doth proclaim to be a stupid fart face.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Nice retort, did G.B. Shaw write that for you?"
Leslie Knope,Did G.B. Shaw write your stupid fart face?
Chief Trumple,"Ladies, if you don't apologize, we're going to have to toss the both of you in jail, so just swallow your pride say you're sorry."
Extra,We hope you enjoy your evening here at the Eagleton holding cell.
Extra,"May I offer you anything, herbal tea, Greek yogurt?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Morning Ron.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, dude, you forgot to put a shirt, I do it all the time, it's fine."
Ron Swanson,I slept here.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet.
Andy Dwyer,"So a little birdie told me it's your birthday coming up, how about a free birthday shoe shine?"
Ron Swanson,What did this little birdie tell you is going to happen for my birthday?
Andy Dwyer,"Nice try Ron, you're not going to get anything out of me."
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, please."
Andy Dwyer,"Look Ron, I love you like a father who's not that much older than me, like a young uncle, or like you're my camp counselor, but we hang out and it's not weird."
Andy Dwyer,"Or actually here's what it is, you're my lacrosse coach--"
Ron Swanson,"I get it, I get it, what's the point?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, coach, Leslie swore me to secrecy, so I can't say anything, I owe her so much I can't ruin it for her."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I respect that, see you later."
Andy Dwyer,"Not if I see you first, uncle Ron, and I probably will because Leslie assigned me to the kidnap squad."
Ann Perkins,Hey jail bird.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming to get me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my god, are you kidding, are you okay."
Leslie Knope,"It was a rough night, but I survived."
Leslie Knope,Scone? They only have maple walnut.
Ann Perkins,"Why did you get arrested, what did you do?"
Leslie Knope,The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"And punching Lindsay in the face, and shoving a coffee filter down her pants."
Leslie Knope,"But in my defense, I believe that assault should be illegal if the person is a jerk."
Ann Perkins,Why are you letting her get to you like this
Leslie Knope,Because she's a stupid jerk.
Leslie Knope,because we were best friends and then she sold out everything that we believed in.
Leslie Knope,"and the worst part, to her our friendship it's like it never happened."
Ann Perkins,"Well first of all, this color looks amazing on you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Second of all, this whole fence thing, she's obviously just trying to get a rise out of you."
Ann Perkins,"Third of all, she knows she only got the job because you turned it down which must drive her nuts."
Ann Perkins,"But most importantly, you say the word, and I will beat her senseless with a baseball bat."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, oh my god, okay we have a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, put these scones in your bra, let's go."
Ann Perkins,Can we just stop off at the lobby because the prison gift bags are amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Hey batter batter batter batter
Andy Dwyer,Crazy base hit.
April Ludgate,Dude stop rooting for the other team.
Andy Dwyer,You're just mad because they are lighting you up.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey Lindsay, introducing the Pawnee wiffle ball league."
Leslie Knope,It's an idea that I came up with after my best friend Ann over there said she wanted to bash your head in with a baseball bat.
Leslie Knope,"and I want to thank you for the fence, there's no way we could afford that high quality wood."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"What if someone hits a homerun, how will you get the ball back?"
Leslie Knope,One of the many Eagleton kids who signed up will just pop over and grab it.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing tonight?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Why?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, I thought maybe you could bust out your old Jazz sweatshirt and you and I could go to Sullivan's for a beer."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do still have that sweatshirt.
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Andy Dwyer,Foul ball.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You did all of this in a day?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I work with some really great people."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you hear the news?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and chris want us to go into conference room C for a meeting.
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Leslie Knope,"Happy birthday, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Ann said you had a big party, sombreros, karaoke."
Leslie Knope,I did that for Ann.
Leslie Knope,why would I throw Ron Swanson an Ann Perkins party?
Ron Swanson,What about that giant list of things April was doing?
Leslie Knope,That was just a list of ways to mess with you.
Leslie Knope,She do them all?
Ron Swanson,She did indeed.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have rented Bridge on the River Kwai and the Dirty Dozen."
Leslie Knope,Artie from security is outside the door so no one will bother you.
Leslie Knope,and a cab will be here whenever you're ready to take you home.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Do you remember what you said to me five years ago when Eagleton offered me that job and I asked you for advice?
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever the hell you want, what do I care?"
Leslie Knope,"Right, but after, when I pressed you?"
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Ron Swanson,"I believe I said that I thought we worked well together, and that I might disagree with your philosophy but I respected you."
Ron Swanson,"and I said that you'll get a lot of job offers in your life, but you only have one hometown."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's how I remember it."
Leslie Knope,"This, by the way, is a onetime only situation."
Leslie Knope,"Next year, your birthday party is going to be a rager."
