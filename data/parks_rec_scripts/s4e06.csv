Andy Dwyer,"Miss Leslie Knope, I present to you Herb Scaifer."
Leslie Knope,"Again, Andy, you don't need to bow."
Andy Dwyer,"As you wish, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Herb, what can I do you for?"
Herb Scaifer,"Well, please prepare yourself."
Herb Scaifer,I have terrible news.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Herb Scaifer,The world is going to end tomorrow at dawn.
Leslie Knope,Aw nuts.
Leslie Knope,You sure it's tomorrow?
Herb Scaifer,Afraid so.
Herb Scaifer,Right at dawn.
Herb Scaifer,"The entire planet, gone."
Leslie Knope,"Not giving me much notice Herb, let me see what I can do."
Leslie Knope,"For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult."
Leslie Knope,And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
Leslie Knope,And they have an all-night vigil in the park.
Leslie Knope,It's super annoying.
Leslie Knope,"Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the portapotties."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight the follower of Reasonablism, will be joining together to await the return of Zorp."
Leslie Knope,The giant lizard God who will destoy the Earth with his cleansing fire of judgment.
Leslie Knope,"Also, light refreshments will be served."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, last year, they had pizza."
Jerry Gergich,Are they going to get pizza again?
Leslie Knope,"It says they've got turkey sandwiches, and the nectar of a thousand sorrows."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that is so good."
Andy Dwyer,It's root beer and red wine.
Andy Dwyer,I went to one meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, I'm going to miss you, enormous chair."
Extra,You really sat in this thing?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it. Felt like a tiny king."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tcups, we did it baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We built a company from the ground up.
Tom Haverford,And then we ran it back into the ground.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Well the important thing to remember, is that it was a masive success."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Remy Martin?
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Tom Haverford,It's up in company heaven.
Tom Haverford,Along with pets.com
Tom Haverford,Blockbuster and askjeeves.
Tom Haverford,My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hello!
Tom Haverford,"So it looks like we'll each end up with about 5,000 dollars apiece."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Stop.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We get five g's each?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's amazing!
Tom Haverford,You started out with 450000.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You remember when DJ Bluntz made us our own personal entrance beats?
Tom Haverford,Remember the opening night party when you danced so hard with Tessa the receptionist that you broke one of your ribs.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It never healed properly.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Every breath is agony, son."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"So what's next, Tommy Davidson?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I say we invest our ten large and then I ""accidentally"" get run over by a city bus and we start our own hiphop label."
Tom Haverford,"Listen, we could play it safe, but that's not what E720 was about."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No it was not.
Tom Haverford,"We have this place for one more night, right?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We're outtie tomorrow at noon.
Tom Haverford,"What if we took every dime we had left, threw one last party."
Tom Haverford,Made it the essence of everything we wanted the company to be.
Tom Haverford,A party For the end of the world.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You had me at ""every dime we have left."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because I'm in, like Lara Flynn, Boyle, from the practice."
Tom Haverford,Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
Chris Traeger,"Why does the cult call themselves ""The Reasonableists""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, they figure if people criticize them, it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable."
Ben Wyatt,That's weirdly brilliant.
Leslie Knope,"Look, there's nothing to worry about, they've said that the world is going to end 15 times."
Leslie Knope,And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
Chris Traeger,That was a tragic day.
Chris Traeger,Live strong.
Chris Traeger,"In any rate, I think Ben and I should accompany you tonight."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't think we have to do that."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, I insist."
Chris Traeger,These people live on planet nutbrain.
Chris Traeger,I live on planet nut bran.
Chris Traeger,Bran and nuts are very helpful for your colon!
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, listen, I'll I'll come for a bit, but if it's okay with you, I'm not going to stay."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, you know, still kind of weird, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmhmm, totally get it."
Leslie Knope,Definitely get it.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Leslie Knope,"Big deal, lots of people don't hang out."
Leslie Knope,Jerry and April.
Leslie Knope,"Obama and Madonna, probably."
Leslie Knope,We're in good company.
April Ludgate,What should we do tonight?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I just figure we'll just order some pizza."
Andy Dwyer,"You watch me play Xbox, and then I could watch you make some prank phone calls?"
Andy Dwyer,We get hammered?
Andy Dwyer,Make out?
April Ludgate,We do that every night.
Andy Dwyer,That's because repetition is the key to a good marriage.
April Ludgate,Let's do something weird.
April Ludgate,"Come on, it could be the last night on earth."
Andy Dwyer,We could do something off my bucket list.
April Ludgate,You have a bucket list?
Andy Dwyer,Catch the winning touchdown at the super bowl.
Andy Dwyer,Make the most amazing grilledcheese sandwich ever.
Andy Dwyer,Win the lottery.
Andy Dwyer,Ride a unicycle.
Andy Dwyer,Invent something.
Andy Dwyer,I'd like to remake the movie Shazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Andy Dwyer,Go skydiving.
Andy Dwyer,Outrun a hippo.
Andy Dwyer,Fly first class on plane.
Andy Dwyer,"And when people are walking by, be like this."
Andy Dwyer,Teach my son to throw the perfect spiral.
Andy Dwyer,Have a son.
April Ludgate,"All right, well, this is what we're doing tonight."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, which one?"
Andy Dwyer,We could change my cell phone plan.
Andy Dwyer,That would be fun.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,This one.
Bank Teller,"800, 900, 1000."
April Ludgate,And how much is left in the bank account?
Bank Teller,18 dollars and four cents.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Still a lot left over.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you wanted to hold 1,000 dollars cash in your hands"
Andy Dwyer,that's super disappointing.
Bank Teller,"998, 999, 1000."
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Now this is what I imagined!
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever seen this much cash in your entire life?
Bank Teller,I just handed it to you.
Andy Dwyer,Nickels!
Andy Dwyer,I want nickels.
Andy Dwyer,A billion nickels!
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Herb."
Ann Perkins,Sorry to bother you.
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, sure."
Ann Perkins,Leslie said you still need to pay for the permit.
Ann Perkins,It's 28 dollars.
Herb Scaifer,"Oh, I'm sorry, here's a check. You can cash that tomorrrow."
Ron Swanson,"Evening, gentlemen."
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, Ron!"
Ron Swanson,Hail Zorp.
Ron Swanson,It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Ron Swanson,Congratulations to all of you for reaching the finish line.
Ron Swanson,The Zorpies are ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,"But, like the founding fathers, I believe in absolute freedom of religion."
Ron Swanson,Also their ceremonies require the playing of flutes.
Ron Swanson,I happen to make flutes in my wood shop.
Ron Swanson,Flutes are 80 dollars apiece.
Ron Swanson,And recorders are 150.
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, they're beautiful."
Herb Scaifer,Would you take a check?
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to E720's end of the world celebration.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The entire party's a VIP area.
Tom Haverford,There's also a double VIP area.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,A triple VIP area.
Tom Haverford,And the Centurion Club elite VIP area.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.
Tom Haverford,"No one's allowed in there, not even us."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uh uh.
Tom Haverford,"We have not one, but six open bars."
Tom Haverford,"and best of all, snake juice ice luge."
Tom Haverford,Juice is so chilled.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Juice is so chilled.
Tom Haverford,Craps.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Roulette.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Argh, matey."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Pirate ship bouncy castle, with bubbles."
Tom Haverford,Shrimp wall.
Tom Haverford,"and special shrimp distributor, Indiana Pacers center, Roy Hibbert."
Roy Hibbert,This is all you want me to do?
Roy Hibbert,Pass out shrimp to people at the party?
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,And stop asking questions.
Tom Haverford,Got a head? Maybe you want a free fedora.
Tom Haverford,Want to make out? Go to our makeout room.
Tom Haverford,"And before you leave, don't forget your gift bag."
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, are there any animals on the guest list tonight?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me check T.T.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oh just one.
Tom Haverford,Bengal Tiger.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Bengal Tiger.
Tom Haverford,"We also hired ten huge, scary bouncers with earpieces."
Tom Haverford,"What up, Keith?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,He actually once tossed me out of a club three years ago.
Tom Haverford,Water under the bridge.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,DJ Bluntz is mixing up some new beats.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Only 200 people will be admitted to retain exclusivity.
Tom Haverford,"Ballers and ballerettes, fasten your seatbelts."
Tom Haverford,The perfect party begins... Clink!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,No one shows up to a good party on time.
Tom Haverford,"If anybody actually showed up right now, the whole party would have been ruined."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It would have been a disaster.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I don't want to go to that party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Does the city consider them a threat to public safety?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, not at all, Shauna MalwaeTweep."
Chris Traeger,It's been over 30 years since there's been any incident involving the Reasonableists.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So I shouldn't interpret anything from the fact that there are two people from the city manager's office here?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, nothing except that I had nothing better to do."
Ben Wyatt,Which probably says more about me than them.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Headline idea.
Leslie Knope,"""It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a little long.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ""Zorp Shmorp!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Doomsday prediction falls flat as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Somehow longer.
Leslie Knope,"Right, okay let's go with the first one."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Great, um, hey, also. He's cute."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Is he single, do you know?"
Leslie Knope,Chris?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's his story?
Leslie Knope,Who?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"He's, um, a man and he's a worker."
Leslie Knope,"And he is, we've never discussed sex, so. It's... we've always just been very business-like, so... Your guess is as good nay, better than mine."
Leslie Knope,The end.
Leslie Knope,By Leslie Knope.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Cool, thanks."
Leslie Knope,Happy to help.
Ann Perkins,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,The world is ending.
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, I know how this goes."
Leslie Knope,I know how Shauna operates.
Leslie Knope,"She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie they're just talking."
Leslie Knope,"What's that, what do you mean just talking?"
Leslie Knope,He's smiling and she's being very charming.
Leslie Knope,Is she more charming than me?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, if you say yes, I will kick, I swear to God."
Ann Perkins,You're definitely more charming.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna remind you that the reason you're not dating him is because you decided to run for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy, okay."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm sure this is nothing."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, that was definitely something."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Ann Perkins,I know that move.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,I've gotta stop this.
Leslie Knope,I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna do that?
Leslie Knope,Unclear!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, ten bucks!"
April Ludgate,That counts as winning the lottery.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, now is this the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made?"
April Ludgate,"Mmm, it's pretty awesome."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, my bucket list doesn't say ""make a pretty awesome grilled cheese sandwich."""
Andy Dwyer,Gotta go back to the store.
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna get a different kind of cheese.
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, dude, seriously."
April Ludgate,"This is the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,What's next?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you two are still talking?"
Leslie Knope,Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So boring.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Actually, we were having a really great talk."
Leslie Knope,Keep your pants on.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, keep your pants on, girl!"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, those are really nice pants."
Leslie Knope,I really like your pants.
Leslie Knope,Where'd you get them?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to go buy some more pants?
Leslie Knope,"Or, um, walk away from here?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I actually think I have everything I need here.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I might head over to that end of the world party.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's where all the losers are going."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what is that?"
Ben Wyatt,Tom emailed me.
Ben Wyatt,I could check that out.
Leslie Knope,"Hur Well, then you should stay here then."
Leslie Knope,Because you can't go.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy, would your face be red."
Herb Scaifer,"When Zorp shows up, your faces will be melted off and used as fuel."
Leslie Knope,You want to be here for that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'll take my chances.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, thanks as always."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Melissa, get in there with your bad self."
Extra,All right.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You ready?
Extra,I'm ready.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Anything you grab is yours to keep.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hit it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!
Tom Haverford,The perfect party.
Tom Haverford,It's an elusive idea.
Tom Haverford,"People have to be completely entertained from the moment they walk in, to the moment they leave."
Tom Haverford,It's a grand experiment.
Tom Haverford,And I am a party scientist.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to my laboratory.
Chris Traeger,So you were living here when Reasonableism first swept in?
Ron Swanson,"I was. Lou Prozotovich, their founder, was an office supply salesman."
Ron Swanson,"One day, he had an interesting idea."
Ron Swanson,Maybe he could write a book to help people organize their offices.
Herb Scaifer,Organize It.
Ron Swanson,The book was a big success.
Ron Swanson,Then Lou had another interesting thought.
Ron Swanson,Maybe there was a 28 foot tall lizard with a volcano for a mouth who controlled the universe.
Chris Traeger,That is interesting.
Ron Swanson,So he wrote a second book.
Herb Scaifer,Organize it 2: Engage with Zorp.
Chris Traeger,"You know, can I have a look at that?"
Herb Scaifer,"Well, sure you can Chris, you can keep it."
Herb Scaifer,I'd skip the first couple chapters if I were you.
Herb Scaifer,"Between you and me, it doesn't really get good until Zorp shows up."
Ron Swanson,Zorp is the lizard.
Ron Swanson,What religion am I?
Ron Swanson,I'm a practicing none of your [bleep] business.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm ready!"
April Ludgate,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Wait!
Andy Dwyer,I'm not ready.
Andy Dwyer,Super scared.
April Ludgate,"Andy, you said you wanted to be an action star."
April Ludgate,This is your chance.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you, Natalie, follow the action."
Jerry Gergich,What do I have to do?
April Ludgate,Just hold up this butter knife to my throat and pretend like you're holding me hostage.
Jerry Gergich,What?
April Ludgate,Ready!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,It seems a little crazy.
Andy Dwyer,Just crazy enough to work.
April Ludgate,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my face!"
Andy Dwyer,My face!
Andy Dwyer,"Is fine, Mikhail Petrov!"
Jerry Gergich,"Forget it, Macklin, you're too late I'm sorry, guys."
April Ludgate,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,I need my cheaters.
Jerry Gergich,I cannot see any
Andy Dwyer,"you're doing really good, you're doing really good."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Help me, Agent Macklin, help me!"
April Ludgate,"He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks!"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's what you think!"
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,I hope you like pain!
Andy Dwyer,Pow!
April Ludgate,Say the line.
Andy Dwyer,Looks like this Siberian husky is going to be Russian off to jail.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, know what, can I go?"
Jerry Gergich,Gayle is making a roast.
Jerry Gergich,Ugh.
Ron Swanson,That was Symphony for the Righteous Destruction of Humanity in E minor.
Ron Swanson,By the late Lou Prozotovich.
Ron Swanson,Reminder.
Ron Swanson,These flutes are available for purchase.
Ron Swanson,You can't take it with you people.
Chris Traeger,"Herb, I just speedread both of your books."
Herb Scaifer,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,"And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkersfilled."
Chris Traeger,But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.
Chris Traeger,Tell me about that.
Herb Scaifer,"Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?"
Herb Scaifer,"From the universe, we emerge."
Herb Scaifer,"Into the universe, we return."
Herb Scaifer,And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.
Chris Traeger,What a lovely thought.
Herb Scaifer,"Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form."
Herb Scaifer,"That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth."
Chris Traeger,That was very strange what you just said.
Chris Traeger,I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.
Herb Scaifer,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, where you going?"
Leslie Knope,Where you headed off to?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chessrisk?
Leslie Knope,"It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go."
Leslie Knope,I okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's going to freak you out.
Leslie Knope,"It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, where are you going?"
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
Leslie Knope,"No spoilers, Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's been there before.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,Are you guys having a good time tonight?
Tom Haverford,I think we've gotta take things to the next level.
Tom Haverford,"Drum line, hit it!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Here we go, here we go."
Ben Wyatt,We've already been down this street.
Leslie Knope,"Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,Tom's party sounded kind of fun.
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,We're at the special place!
Leslie Knope,"Well, here we are."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?
Leslie Knope,"No, this is a great gas station."
Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M."
Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958."
Ben Wyatt,When he was 8.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome."
Ben Wyatt,"I know what you're doing, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
Ben Wyatt,You you can't do this.
Ben Wyatt,You know we broke up.
Ben Wyatt,"And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us."
Ben Wyatt,"Because every time we do, it just makes it harder."
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This one would get me arrested and this other one's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,because we need Eddie Vedder and a time machine.
Andy Dwyer,I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's it."
April Ludgate,What about this?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that would be awesome."
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible.
April Ludgate,"No, it isn't."
April Ludgate,"We have 1000 dollars in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, our car would break down."
Andy Dwyer,There's no way we could even get there.
April Ludgate,So I'll steal my dad's car.
April Ludgate,"Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is."
Andy Dwyer,You are absolutely right.
Andy Dwyer,"No thinking, just stupid."
April Ludgate,Yes!
Chris Traeger,Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.
Chris Traeger,So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.
Chris Traeger,Or a socket wrench.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?"
Ron Swanson,"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually."
Ann Perkins,I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins that was beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Let's go to that party that Tom's having.
Chris Traeger,Have some fun in this life.
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.
Ron Swanson,"Wait, I want to change my answer, I'll go with bolt cutters."
Ann Perkins,Maybe you'll be reincarnated as a good dancer.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, you zinged me. I love that."
Donna Meagle,This is the best party I've ever been to.
Donna Meagle,And I'm not just saying that.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"For real, T.T., think about it man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Drum lines, personalized gift bags, tigers."
Tom Haverford,It's pretty great.
Tom Haverford,But it's not perfect.
Tom Haverford,I mean David Beckham didn't show up.
Donna Meagle,You knew that one was a long shot.
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, this is perfect."
Tom Haverford,I guess.
Lucy,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here?"
Lucy,Jean-Ralphio called me and told me that this was a very special occasion and I should come down.
Lucy,It's nice to see you.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, good to see you too."
Lucy,Want to go dance?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah! Uh, give me a minute."
Lucy,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe you called her for me.
Tom Haverford,"That's really nice of you, man, for real."
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, no, thank you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I mean for everything.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I actually forgot they ever dated.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I was trying to hit that.
Herb Scaifer,"Dawn is nigh! Zorp the surveyor approaches, and all earthly debts will be repaid to the original source of life in the universe."
Herb Scaifer,Last call for doughnuts.
Leslie Knope,What would you do if the world was really going to end?
Ron Swanson,"I'd go home, drink some whiskey."
Ron Swanson,Then I'd go see my exwives.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I want to watch them meet their fiery end with my own eyes."
Ron Swanson,What would you do?
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you about a personal matter?
Ron Swanson,"Normally, no."
Ron Swanson,"But given there's only 20 minutes until the end of human existence Also, no."
Leslie Knope,I lost my mind tonight.
Leslie Knope,I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Ron Swanson,Did you not hear me when I said no?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we broke up because of me."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's significant."
Ron Swanson,"Problem is, Leslie, the world's not ending tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,The sun's going to rise right over there.
Ron Swanson,"It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I made my decision. I need to stick to it.
Leslie Knope,It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
Herb Scaifer,"If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope,That does make me feel better.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Herb."
Ron Swanson,Guy's got ears like a fruit bat.
April Ludgate,We did it!
Andy Dwyer,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,This car is nice!
Andy Dwyer,How long you think it'll take us?
April Ludgate,"Uh, the map says 30 hours but I drive really fast."
Andy Dwyer,30 hours?

Tom Haverford,"Are, uh, you sticking around for a bit, or"
Lucy,"Nah, I'm heading to Bloomington right now."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Lucy,"Grad school's fun, but I do miss this town."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Lucy,What's wrong?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"After this is done, I'm gonna be broke, and I'm not gonna have a job."
Lucy,"Well, if it's any consolation, this was honestly the best party I've ever been to."

Tom Haverford,I I was really aiming for something
Lucy,I'll see you around.
Tom Haverford,Whoo.
Tom Haverford,You saw that.

Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Leslie Knope,"Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children."
Leslie Knope,And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
Leslie Knope,So I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, Shauna's not here."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,See what I did?
Ben Wyatt,I do.
Leslie Knope,I'm very sneaky.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, well."
Andy Dwyer,It's so much more beautiful than I could have ever even imagined.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"I'm trying to find a way to be annoyed by it, but Coming up empty."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer,I never would have ever done this without you.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Where's all the faces? Like the presidents.
Herb Scaifer,"Frankly, Leslie, I'm shocked."
Herb Scaifer,All the scholarly work that I did on these texts? Indicated that the world would end.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb."
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, but when the world did not end, I went home and began to reevaluate the texts."
Leslie Knope,You don't say.
Herb Scaifer,And I realized that I'd made some crucial errors
Leslie Knope,"well, math is hard."
Herb Scaifer,"Yes, well, the actual end of the world is six months from now."
Herb Scaifer,May 19th.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's see what we've got."
Leslie Knope,"Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park."
Leslie Knope,We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Herb Scaifer,"Heh! Look here, I misspoke."
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, it's May 20?"
Leslie Knope,That is free.
Herb Scaifer,Ah!
Herb Scaifer,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"End of World, May 20th."
Herb Scaifer,And could you put aside ten tickets to that ice cream thing?
Leslie Knope,Already did.
