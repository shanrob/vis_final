Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,I guess we're even.
Ben Wyatt,"If you need me, I'll I'll definitely be awake."
Ben Wyatt,Because I won't be able to sleep.
Ben Wyatt,Because of the party.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,So All right.
Ben Wyatt,My family is very nonconfrontational.
Ben Wyatt,My parents' method of problem solving is to kind of keep everything bottled up and just subtly hint at what's bothering them.
Ben Wyatt,"And after 36 years, they are still divorced."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is not what I pictured at all."
Leslie Knope,This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,Is Entertainment 720 running for office?
Tom Haverford,It's a small business.
Tom Haverford,You're trying to show people you have a good relationship with small businesses.
Tom Haverford,"Now the party, that's all about you, Boo."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs?"
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, no."
Tom Haverford,It's always been a dream of mine to be a rug.

Chris Traeger,"Oh, good, I'll text her."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you can text without looking at your phone?"
Chris Traeger,I think it's rude not to maintain eye contact with people that I'm talking to.
Chris Traeger,That's from me.
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Jerry Gergich,that's amazing.
Chris Traeger,High five.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.

Ron Swanson,"Andrew, are you aware that your bathroom faucet is leaking?"
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
Andy Dwyer,I just stuffed a sock in it yesterday.
Andy Dwyer,What else do they want me to do?
Ron Swanson,There's an exposed wire above the bathtub as well.

Tanya,"Mm, I've never seen you buy a salad at Sue's Salads."
Leslie Knope,"That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things."
Leslie Knope,And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Leslie Knope,"Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well."
Leslie Knope,"When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr. President."
Martin Kernston,Martin.
Leslie Knope,Martin.
Martin Kernston,"You were responsible for the Harvest Festival, right?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Well It was a team effort.
Leslie Knope,I barely did anything.

Leslie Knope,They succeeded despite me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I worked very hard on that event.
Leslie Knope,I'm just.
Leslie Knope,Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, come over here and talk about how great I am."
Tom Haverford,"Martin, Tom Haverford I threw this shindig"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on the Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,It was incredible.
Tom Haverford,A lot of people say the Harvest Festival is what launched Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,No one says that.
Tom Haverford,I just said it.
Tom Haverford,"My company, Entertainment 720, has an amazing business opportunity for Kernston's."
Tom Haverford,Mind if I steal you away for a few seconds?
Tom Haverford,Give you the 'tails?
Martin Kernston,The 'tails?
Tom Haverford,The details.
Tom Haverford,"Most people would probably say ""the deets."""
Tom Haverford,"I say ""the 'tails."""
Tom Haverford,Just one example of innovation.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't like to throw around the word ""butthead"" too often."
Leslie Knope,"If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact."
Leslie Knope,But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You stole the nipple king.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks a lot, traitor."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, I just needed to ask him about this one thing, but we're all good now."
Tom Haverford,what if I just introduce you for your speech?
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face?
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your ""help"" anymore."
Extra,Hi there.
Extra,Is there a project you're working on?
Ron Swanson,I know more than you.
Extra,All right.
Ron Swanson,"When April and Andy married, I didn't get them a wedding present."
Ron Swanson,"In my experience, wedding presents are nothing more than kindling on a divorce bonfire."
Ron Swanson,But I think I found a way I can really help them make a home.
Ron Swanson,"You, beanbag, come with me."
Ann Perkins,I'm an eggplant.
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ann Perkins,Why?

Andy Dwyer,You should go wear that.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna put on a costume because I'm not really attending this party That's at my house."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, listen, if you're mad about something, you should just"

Ron Swanson,Now
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,We made it work.

Ron Swanson,I'm gonna go around this house and fix everything I can find that needs fixing.
Ron Swanson,You wanna help?
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,That's next.
Tom Haverford,"I can't reveal my identity because of various corporate enemies, but suffice it to say, I run a fairly popular social networking site."
Tom Haverford,"And let's face it, booking e720 was the smartest decision I ever made."
Tom Haverford,I hope you liked this story.
Tom Haverford,I invented Facebook.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um I know that video seemed like the rantings of a lunatic pretending to be Mark zuckerberg"
Tom Haverford,That's who that was?
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,That is impressive.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time."
Tom Haverford,Agreed.
Tom Haverford,Let's get right to it.
Tom Haverford,Please welcome the e720 mailing list divas!
Tom Haverford,I want all of y'all to write down the name and direct phone line for whoever's in charge of hiring independent contractors for your business!
Tom Haverford,Now come join me and let's all take a dip in the e720 mobile hot tub!
Tom Haverford,It's parked right outside.
Tom Haverford,Le'go.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
April Ludgate,Thought you weren't coming to the party.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm just having a butterfinger."
April Ludgate,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Is that okay?

April Ludgate,"You're not part of the party, you can't have the candy."
April Ludgate,Back up.
Ben Wyatt,All right.

April Ludgate,I have one sister.
April Ludgate,"We steal each other's stuff, hack each other's Twitter accounts, set each other's clothes on fire."
April Ludgate,There are no rules.
Andy Dwyer,We need to deal with what's bothering you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, please, come into my room."
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,You're angry at me and you're not talking about it.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna beat you up until you do, because I'm mature."
Ben Wyatt,What are you Stop it.
Andy Dwyer,I grew up with five brothers and we fought.
Andy Dwyer,"Using the Dwyer method, which was yelling, wrestling, crying, followed by lots of hugs."
Andy Dwyer,"And then more wrestling, but the fun kind, and then crying when the fun kind of wrestling got out of hand."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, can you let me go?"
Andy Dwyer,Not 'til you tell me what's wrong.
Leslie Knope,"Um, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Martin Kernston,"Leslie, I'm a frugal man."
Martin Kernston,I don't like extravagance or showmanship.
Martin Kernston,That's why I cut my own hair.
Martin Kernston,And it's what's made me a successful businessman.
Martin Kernston,"So if Entertainment 720 is the kind of business you trust, I'm afraid you and I don't share the same values."
Leslie Knope,"There you are, you little bastard."
Leslie Knope,Get out of there right now.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, can you do me a favor and just let me sit here?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends."
Tom Haverford,I'm not getting out.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, then I'm getting in."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get away from me."
Leslie Knope,You know what you are?
Leslie Knope,"You're a selfish little punk, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to listen to me!
Leslie Knope,You didn't even let me have my one night.
Leslie Knope,Look at me!
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face.
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face!
Leslie Knope,I've been looking at your face all night.
Leslie Knope,God!
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,My company's bankrupt.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Ron Swanson,Excuse us.
Ron Swanson,"Nice form, son."
Ron Swanson,Make sure you keep a firm pressure on the cranium.
Andy Dwyer,On the cranium?
Ron Swanson,Listen up!
Ron Swanson,I have to turn off the power for one minute.
Ann Perkins,"We're gonna go dark, people."
Ann Perkins,"Bear with us, okay?"
Ann Perkins,We gotta switch off the main fuse hose.
Ron Swanson,It's just a fuse.
Ann Perkins,"It's just a fuse, People."
Ann Perkins,Just a fuse.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub."
Tom Haverford,I'm too sad to get out.
Tom Haverford,And I'm all pruney.
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"I guess I just didn't moisturize enough this morning, and I've been laying around"
Leslie Knope,"With the company, Tom."
Tom Haverford,We're hemorrhaging cash ever since we opened.
Tom Haverford,They say you've got to spend money to make money.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know where we went wrong."
Tom Haverford,We spent all of our money.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what you need?
Leslie Knope,Some good oldfashioned comfort food.
Tom Haverford,Where are we gonna get Albacore tuna with crispy onions at this hour?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,Looks like you've got the handle on that torque wrench.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, the flange was a little warped."
Ann Perkins,So I just goosed it with a triple three bolt smack.
Ron Swanson,That was nonsense.
Ann Perkins,"I know, but it's so fun to talk like that."
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Keep this.
Ron Swanson,You earned it.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I need to get more chips.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, walk."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,This is a pacifist protest.
Ben Wyatt,Had enough?
Ben Wyatt,You need to let go of me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get it."
Andy Dwyer,That's good.
Andy Dwyer,There we go.
Ben Wyatt,Let go of me.
Andy Dwyer,He's got his back.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, fight me."
Ben Wyatt,No!
Andy Dwyer,Noooo.
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, I am so sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Psych!
Andy Dwyer,Blood capsules.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,I wanted to shock you into expressing your anger.
Andy Dwyer,And that way !
Andy Dwyer,My nose is broken.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I gotta go to the hospital.
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Didn't it feel good?
April Ludgate,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,Yup!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I thought you guys were doing great."
Leslie Knope,I remember trying to hire you once.
Leslie Knope,And you said you were all booked up.
Tom Haverford,That was a business tactic.
Tom Haverford,"For the first two weeks, we told everyone we were booked solid to make people want us more."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard."
Tom Haverford,"Well, hindsight is 20/20."
Leslie Knope,Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Leslie Knope,"Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't make any sense.
Leslie Knope,It's gibberish.
Tom Haverford,We made some mistakes.
Tom Haverford,Tonight was my last chance to land a big client.
Tom Haverford,And I failed again.
Tom Haverford,"God, it's so embarrassing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy."
Leslie Knope,And charming.
Leslie Knope,Occasionally.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,Sorry I screwed up your campaign thing.
Tom Haverford,I really wanted to do a good job.
Tom Haverford,I made you this amazing video biography.
Leslie Knope,Of my life?
Tom Haverford,It's back at the office.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's eat and go."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this?
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Ben Wyatt,"Ugh, does it hurt?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you broke my nose, so"
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,But I don't even care.
Andy Dwyer,"Just get it all out there, man."
Andy Dwyer,Go.
Ben Wyatt,All right maybe you have to start thinking about how how your actions affect me.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, tell me about stuff happening in the house."
Ben Wyatt,Stop referring to my bedroom as a common space.
Ben Wyatt,Stop using my comforter for your pillow forts.
Ben Wyatt,Just respect me.
Andy Dwyer,Absolutely.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,"And in return, I'll only ask for one thing, which is for you to pay for studio recording time for my band to do our new album."
Andy Dwyer,"It's gonna be about 5,600 bucks."
Andy Dwyer,Deal?
Ben Wyatt,That's not gonna happen.
Nurse,Here's something for the pain and some ice packs.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Nurse,You his friend?
Andy Dwyer,"Him? Hell, no."
Andy Dwyer,We're brothers.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
April Ludgate,We should go.
April Ludgate,I'm blocking an ambulance.
April Ludgate,"Ew, if your nose is all weird after this, I'm totally gonna divorce you."
Andy Dwyer,"Whatever, I'm gonna divorce you first for wearing my favorite hoodie."
April Ludgate,Is everything cool?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it is."
April Ludgate,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,We just can't use Ben's comforters anymore for our pillow forts.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, what are we gonna have sex on?"
Tom Haverford,The year was 1975.
Tom Haverford,It was a time of trouble.
Tom Haverford,"Watergate, Vietnam, Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis."
Tom Haverford,"But then, a ray of hope Leslie Barbara Knope was born on January 18, 1975."
Tom Haverford,And she has been a loyal patron of its businesses ever since.
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person."
Leslie Knope,He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
Leslie Knope,I think he technically might have bribed him.
Leslie Knope,"But hey, you know, whatever works."
Leslie Knope,"It was Mary Pickford who once said, ""This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down."""
Leslie Knope,Tom won't be down for long.
Tom Haverford,Her name is Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,And I'm gonna vote for her.
Tom Haverford,"And if Lil' Sebastian were still alive, he'd surely vote for her."
Tom Haverford,And I reckon you should too.
Tom Haverford,"Did ya like it? It's pretty great, right? Worked really hard on it."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
Leslie Knope,"And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone."
Chris Traeger,I had an amazing time at that party.
Chris Traeger,"And in the case of the woman who's stolen my heart, the culprit was Millicent Gergich."
Millicent Gergich,You should look into actual detective work.
Chris Traeger,I will.
Chris Traeger,"And, Jerry, I've decided to take your daughter home."
Chris Traeger,And we may be having intercourse.
Jerry Gergich,"Please, you've got to stop saying things like that to me."
Chris Traeger,"You've got it, man."
Millicent Gergich,"Bye, dad."
Millicent Gergich,Everything okay?
Chris Traeger,I can't find my car keys.
April Ludgate,"Solve this mystery, genius."
