Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department."
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a few questions?
Leslie Knope,"Would you say that you are, ""Enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?"""
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Child,"Ms. Knope, there's a drunk stuck in the slide."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, this is a children's slide."
Leslie Knope,You're not allowed to sleep in here.
Extra,What is?
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, ""Oh."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government stinks."""
Leslie Knope,"""The lines are too long at the DMV."""
Leslie Knope,But now things have changed.
Leslie Knope,People need our help.
Leslie Knope,And it feels good to be needed.
Leslie Knope,Could you put your arms to your side?
Leslie Knope,And that might help you slide down a little easier.
Drunk,We don't--
Leslie Knope,Do you want to come this way?
Drunk,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're gonna need you to get out."
Drunk,Can you please go away?
Leslie Knope,Get out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Drunk,You're Can you please go away?
Leslie Knope,Here we go!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wake up."
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,"You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore."
Leslie Knope,Women are everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Leslie Knope,"Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi."
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,"You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, because my ride's gonna be a big one."""
Leslie Knope,"And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one."
Ron Swanson,Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
Leslie Knope,And that is tonight.
Ron Swanson,That is tonight.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Ron Swanson,Leslie will be running it.
Ron Swanson,And we need one more.
Ron Swanson,Who wants in?
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,This is a great thing for you guys to see.
Leslie Knope,This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
Leslie Knope,"When I go through these doors, I need to be on."
Leslie Knope,Like the White House Press Secretary.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,It's locked.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,What an amazing turnout.
Leslie Knope,My name is Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as--"
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting in here.
Tom Haverford,Does anybody have any questions about permits?
Leslie Knope,"So, take two."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away."
Extra,"Well, it's a great day, because last month they put me in jail."
Extra,That's right.
Extra,The head of the police is a ninth degree Mason.
Extra,But the music is so loud.
Extra,"Stop the graffiti, please."
Extra,Please.
Leslie Knope,I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
Extra,"No, it drives me crazy."
Extra,I have kids.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Extra,"But I've got my little three year old, I'm going through the park and someone's like, ""Hey [bleep] my [bleep]"" And the guy's, ""You [bleep] my [bleep], you [bleep] head."""
Leslie Knope,"These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me."
Extra,"Now, I have a few things I want to say about Laura Linney."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barry."
Leslie Knope,Always great to have you here.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else who would like to contribute?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, hi."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Tell us about that.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's a problem."
Ann Perkins,It almost killed my boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year."
Leslie Knope,"Twelve months, yes."
Leslie Knope,Go on.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute."
Tom Haverford,"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?"
Tom Haverford,Are you guys living together?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you."
Tom Haverford,"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken."
Tom Haverford,He's just weak.
Tom Haverford,You have to take care of him.
Tom Haverford,You probably feel like you need to move on.
Ann Perkins,What does this--
Tom Haverford,"Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in"
Ann Perkins,Are you actually hitting on me right now?
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"God, no."
Tom Haverford,I'm not hitting on you.
Tom Haverford,I'm actually married.
Tom Haverford,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people."
Tom Haverford,"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women."
Tom Haverford,I've spent a lot of time with them.
Tom Haverford,And I just-- I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
Tom Haverford,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this."
Ann Perkins,Look --
Tom Haverford,I'd love to do it.
Ann Perkins,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government owned, and you need to do something about it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll do something about it.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we-- I will help you."
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats."
Leslie Knope,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam."
Tom Haverford,"No, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,"Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me."
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Mr. Mayor."
Tom Haverford,That sounds good.
Tom Haverford,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
Tom Haverford,Bye.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, hello."
Leslie Knope,You were talking to the mayor?
Tom Haverford,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things."
Leslie Knope,Tom and I work really well together.
Leslie Knope,We're both outsiders.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan."
Tom Haverford,"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina."
Tom Haverford,I am what you might call a redneck.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, brainstorm."
Leslie Knope,How do we make this park happen?
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
Leslie Knope,"No, parks are not a priority."
Leslie Knope,I need more firepower.
Leslie Knope,I need bigger guns.
Leslie Knope,You know what I need to do?
Leslie Knope,Form a committee.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that could work."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen."
Leslie Knope,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
Leslie Knope,That's really good.
Leslie Knope,Write that down.
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down."
Leslie Knope,He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Tom Haverford,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, read it back to me."
Tom Haverford,"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood."""
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Sounded better when I said it.
Leslie Knope,"It's still good, though."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,What about bringing Mark on board?
Tom Haverford,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz.
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that."
Leslie Knope,He's kind of like a fixer.
Leslie Knope,He fixes things.
Leslie Knope,"He's a smart, capable guy."
Leslie Knope,He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Brendanawicz?"
Leslie Knope,You crazy old Polish person.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it."
Leslie Knope,You gotta leave the locker room.
Leslie Knope,Let's get down to brass tacks.
Leslie Knope,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just work right there.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule."
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't clear anything.
Leslie Knope,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, Lot 48."
Mark Brendanawicz,Condo developer.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt."
Mark Brendanawicz,I checked it out like a month ago.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's pretty gross.
Leslie Knope,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
Mark Brendanawicz,"A park, huh?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not likely, you know."
Mark Brendanawicz,"But, is it possible?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not possible.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would give up on that one.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's like a million reasons why.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape--"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no way it can happen.
Leslie Knope,I can do this.
Leslie Knope,I just need a little help.
Leslie Knope,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?"
Leslie Knope,Mark and I-- It's complicated.
Leslie Knope,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen."
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I sort of-- No, but yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?"
Ann Perkins,'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Ann Perkins,Can-- Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit."
Ann Perkins,I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about--"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm trying to watch TV.
Ann Perkins,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
Leslie Knope,It's Ms. Perkins' house.
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I heard it."
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Ann Perkins,I'm getting it.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,Safety.
Leslie Knope,You remember Tom from last night.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ann, how are you?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hey."
Ann Perkins,Of course I do.
Leslie Knope,"And this is our college intern, April."
Leslie Knope,She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
April Ludgate,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Is this fun for you?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's so much fun."
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,This must be our hero.
Leslie Knope,The man heard 'round the world.
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"How you doing, son?"
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Andy Dwyer,Could you pass me my itch stick?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Ann Perkins,"So, Andy jumped over this fence."
Ann Perkins,"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,How did we let this happen?
Leslie Knope,"Dream with me for a second, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
Leslie Knope,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field."
Leslie Knope,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
Ann Perkins,It's really not that big of a pit.
Leslie Knope,We could do some of those things.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna take a little extra work.
Leslie Knope,But why not try?
Ann Perkins,I think that would be great.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm going in.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I have a hard hat on.
Ann Perkins,"I can see that, but--"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"April, document this."
April Ludgate,Document what?
Leslie Knope,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?"
Leslie Knope,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you okay?"
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website."
April Ludgate,Could you just be still?
Tom Haverford,Don't move around as much.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, squeeze my fingers."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Does it hurt a lot?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
Ann Perkins,But it-- It fell off.
Leslie Knope,After my head hit that rod.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't believe you fell in, too."
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Ann Perkins,"It's not awesome, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle."
Ann Perkins,It's not broken.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, you're fine."
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?"
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Are pancakes being made?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No way.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Leslie Knope,Give me my shot.
Leslie Knope,Let me have Lot 48.
Ron Swanson,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you."
Leslie Knope,When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?
Ron Swanson,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have."
Ron Swanson,When you fell in.
Leslie Knope,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means."
Leslie Knope,"And let me tell you something, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What it means is I want this subcommittee.
Ron Swanson,I've been quite open about this around the office.
Ron Swanson,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
Ron Swanson,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
Ron Swanson,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
Ron Swanson,Like Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,They have an impeccable business model.
Ron Swanson,I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I will definitely think about it."
Leslie Knope,I like the sound of that definitely.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, I presume."
Leslie Knope,Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?
Leslie Knope,Giving the park to me?
Ron Swanson,Still mulling.
Ron Swanson,She's insatiable.
Ron Swanson,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
Leslie Knope,"All right, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"All right, all right."
Leslie Knope,I'll ask him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Leslie Knope,Someone on the phone about the park.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't think I even want it."
Leslie Knope,Oh man.
Leslie Knope,My clavicle's still really hurting me.
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,This is a great shot.
April Ludgate,I know.
Tom Haverford,That's awesome.
April Ludgate,I think she's crying in that one.
April Ludgate,Look at this one.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, kids."
Tom Haverford,That's another good one.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,You gotta come check this out.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside."
Tom Haverford,And we have some awesome photos.
April Ludgate,One.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is she okay?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, she's fine."
Tom Haverford,Oh! This is a classic.
April Ludgate,That's the best one.
Tom Haverford,The up-skirt photo.
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,Give me the photo back.
Tom Haverford,What's going on?
April Ludgate,Don't worry.
April Ludgate,I can print more.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is unique.
Mark Brendanawicz,Government work can beat you down.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie's kept hers for six years.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules."
Mark Brendanawicz,I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
Ron Swanson,Why should I?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You owe me one, remember?"
Ron Swanson,Do you want to cash in for this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I do."
Leslie Knope,"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,This is our crown jewel.
Leslie Knope,It's one of our best murals.
Leslie Knope,It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster."
Ann Perkins,That is horrifying.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--"
Tom Haverford,Leslie! We did it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's approved our committee.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Ann Perkins,That's so great.
Leslie Knope,That's so exciting! This is huge.
Leslie Knope,"I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,I'm a rocket ship.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just heard the news.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it great?
Mark Brendanawicz,Congratulations.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited.
Leslie Knope,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Should I call a press conference now, or--"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, call one."
Tom Haverford,Definitely.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would.
Tom Haverford,"Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered."
Tom Haverford,One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.
Tom Haverford,She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.
Tom Haverford,"On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman."
Tom Haverford,Not Batgirl.
Tom Haverford,Batman.
Tom Haverford,And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
Tom Haverford,And it is my favorite thing in the world.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,America is awesome.
Leslie Knope,It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
Leslie Knope,You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You gotta be ready for it.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Ann Perkins,Definitely am.
Ann Perkins,Fired up.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,I'm really fired up.
Ann Perkins,"You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved."
Ann Perkins,So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Ann Perkins,Even if it takes two months.
Leslie Knope,"Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sweet Lady Marmalard
Ron Swanson,I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
Ron Swanson,This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
Ron Swanson,People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Ron Swanson,Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.
Ron Swanson,I don't want to see any double dribble.
Ron Swanson,I don't want to see any three second violations.
Ron Swanson,Bobby Knight!
