Ben Wyatt,So what do we got so far?
Ben Wyatt,We need big ticket items.
April Ludgate,I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers to send us a signed guitar.
Leslie Knope,"That's great, April."
Leslie Knope,How'd you do that?
Leslie Knope,"It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis."
Leslie Knope,"We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too."
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we put a pin in this?
Ben Wyatt,'Cause we have to do that thing.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"All right, yep."
Ben Wyatt,"Just, likeâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, keep working."
Leslie Knope,We'll be back.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, hey, you haven't told anyone about the baby, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, but my brain is about to explode from stress."
Andy Dwyer,I am not good at keeping secrets.
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly what I told Kyle when he told me his wife was cheating on him.
Kyle,"Andy, come on!"
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Kyle,"Not cool, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Not him, not that Kyle."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people."
Leslie Knope,"So just hang in there, please."
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,People do this.
Andy Dwyer,People keep secrets.
Andy Dwyer,My neighbor Eric he's kept a secret for 20 years.
Andy Dwyer,He's in Witness Protection.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Donna Meagle,You wanted to see me?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I need to ask you for a favor.
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson asking for help?
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman!"
Ron Swanson,Part of the unity concert is a youth revue about the history of Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,"They require volunteers, so I want you to come with me to my daughters' public elementary school to help make costumes."
Donna Meagle,The elementary school?
Donna Meagle,"I'll do you this solid, but you're gonna have to keep an eye out for my ex-boyfriend Joe."
Donna Meagle,"He teaches music at that school, and he is a nightmare."
Donna Meagle,He's my Tammy.
Ron Swanson,Your Tammy?
Ron Swanson,"Donna, my two ex-wives are the worst people in the world."
Ron Swanson,Tammy two once seduced a coroner and had me declared legally dead just so she could get a discount on a plane ticket.
Donna Meagle,"When I'm with Joe, he turns me into a person I don't like or recognize."
Donna Meagle,I go insane.
Donna Meagle,All I'm asking is for you to keep him away from me.
Ron Swanson,I understand this problem well and agree to this exchange of services.
Leslie Knope,"We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble."
Leslie Knope,What else can we auction off?
Leslie Knope,What about those fish?
Leslie Knope,Think they're valuable?
Leslie Knope,Cover me.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should start taking it easy.
Ben Wyatt,You're stressing out for two now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, that's actually a pretty decent tshirt idea."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I cannot slow down."
Leslie Knope,The concert is in three weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr. Saperstein what he thinks."
Dr. Saperstein,"Someone say ""Saperstein""?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Come on, you two."
Dr. Saperstein,Let's saddle you up and put some jelly on the belly.
Leslie Knope,He's a little weird.
Ben Wyatt,Mmhmm.
Craig Middlebrooks,Look at me!
Andy Dwyer,Geez.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, here's what's happening-- I want to auction off a personalized Johnny Karate song tomorrow, so I need you to come to the auction."
Andy Dwyer,Auction?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Let me write that down.
April Ludgate,"Andy, you already have three Johnny Karate shows tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,"No, not according to my file here."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I forgot, other hand."
Andy Dwyer,Crap.
April Ludgate,"Okay, we need a better system."
April Ludgate,"Look, I'll just write down an itinerary for you, so you can just focus on songs."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, you have to catalog all this stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, this is hours' worth of work."
April Ludgate,What is that?
April Ludgate,"""Don't tell secret""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, that's not one."
April Ludgate,"Andy, if you have a secret, you have to tell me."
April Ludgate,That's the whole point of marriage.
April Ludgate,You get twice the secrets.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, it is nothing."
Andy Dwyer,I don't have anything.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,You're acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,I have to get back to work now.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Donna Meagle,I'm getting a picture of you volunteering at a public elementary school in case I ever need to blackmail you.
Donna Meagle,"That's Joe, 12:00."
Joe,"Donna, how are you?"
Joe,It's really nice to see you.
Donna Meagle,Mmhmm.
Joe,Thank you so much for helping out.
Joe,These kids are so lucky to have your fashion expertise.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Joe."
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I am Donna's work proximity associate.
Joe,"Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me so much about you."
Joe,It's nice to put a face to the name.
Ron Swanson,Mmhmm.
Joe,"Well, I gotta get back to my classroom."
Joe,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Ron."
Joe,"And if either of you guys need anything at all today, please do not hesitate to ask, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm onto you, friend."
Joe,What?
Ron Swanson,Tread lightly.
Joe,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam."
Dr. Saperstein,"Your body is going through some changes, but you're a healthy gal, right, Leslie?"
Dr. Saperstein,There is no reason for you not to be yourself.
Leslie Knope,I win.
Ben Wyatt,It wasn't a competition.
Dr. Saperstein,All right.
Dr. Saperstein,Let's see what's going down in baby town.
Dr. Saperstein,There's your healthy baby.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, and there's another one."
Ben Wyatt,The baby has two bodies?
Leslie Knope,Twins.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're having twins."
Dr. Saperstein,"No, you're not, 'cause look who's hiding over here."
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Dr. Saperstein,And here's a fourth.
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm so sorry, no."
Dr. Saperstein,It's a little fleck of cream cheese on the screen.
Dr. Saperstein,Just triplets.
Dr. Saperstein,"Wow, you guys really dodged a bullet."
Dr. Saperstein,Can you imagine raising four children at one time?
Dr. Saperstein,"Ha, a nightmare."
Ben Wyatt,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,We knocked it out of the park on the first try.
Leslie Knope,"If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!"
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Leslie Knope,This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!"
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, actually, one in 8,000."
Dr. Saperstein,"Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine, especially at your age."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Dr. Saperstein,Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.
Dr. Saperstein,"It's what we doctors like to call, and I don't mean to be insensitive, a going out of business sale."
Ben Wyatt,"So, doctor, um, what do we like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Um, how do we how how how how what do we do?"
Dr. Saperstein,"The first thing you do is, you forget everything that I said before because you, young lady, need a lot of rest and especially avoiding stress."
Dr. Saperstein,"Leslie, I need you to be Buddha on quaaludes, and, Ben, you are Matthew McConaughey in a hammock on the beach."
Ben Wyatt,"Alright, alright."
Ben Wyatt,Alright.
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Ben Wyatt,Three kids?
Ben Wyatt,"I just multiplied all our future expenses by three, and you know what happened?"
Ben Wyatt,The numbers got a lot higher.
Ben Wyatt,I think I heard the computer laugh at me.
Ben Wyatt,And Saperstein wants us to relax?
Leslie Knope,"Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I will be there in two flaps of a butterfly's wing, and I love you."
Ben Wyatt,We are so [bleep] screwed.
Ron Swanson,Uh-oh.
Ron Swanson,"What did you do now, Joe?"
Extra,Thank you so much.
Extra,We thought we were gonna have to tell Dylan that his doggie was gone forever.
Joe,"Oh, my gosh."
Joe,"Barbara, don't even mention it."
Joe,"Look, I hate it when my students are upset, so I just went out, driving around."
Joe,I checked a few neighborhood parks.
Joe,It took barely six hours.
Extra,"Oh, how can we ever repay you?"
Joe,No need.
Joe,Would you like a muffin?
Joe,I made them last night.
Extra,It's the best muffin I've ever had.
Joe,"You're welcome, guys."
Joe,You're welcome.
Joe,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,So whose birthday is it anyway?
Councilman Dexhart,"Oh, who knows?"
Councilman Dexhart,"I got so many kids from different women, I just get all of their birthdays out of the way one day a year."
Councilman Dexhart,Ladies.
April Ludgate,"Okay, so when this ends, we have a half hour to get to the next party."
April Ludgate,"That gives us 15 minutes of travel time, and 15 minutes for you to take a wetnap shower in the car."
Andy Dwyer,"Good, I need one."
April Ludgate,"Also, tell me your secret."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, don't make me tell."
Andy Dwyer,I don't wanna break my promise.
Andy Dwyer,Tell me now.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, Geez, this is heavy."
Jerry Gergich,Pardon me.
Andy Dwyer,It's about Larry.
Andy Dwyer,He is very sick.
Andy Dwyer,He has some kind of disease.
April Ludgate,"Oh, so that's why you've been so nice to him and let him carry all your stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, that's the reason."
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."
Jerry Gergich,Geez.
April Ludgate,Poor guy.

Leslie Knope,How magnificent.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Leslie, that's less than face value."
Craig Middlebrooks,"You need passion, zeal, showmanship."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I don't have the gavel, so I'm powerless."
Craig Middlebrooks,I respect the hierarchy of the auction!
Ben Wyatt,I think Leslie's doing a great job.
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, Craig."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you doing all right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You want to do some tai chi?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm doing really fine."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie is already the queen of stress, so I have to be like her stress shamwow."
Ben Wyatt,"I wrap myself around her, I soak up all of her stress, and then after the kids are born, someone can squeeze me out into a bucket."
Zoe Lewis,Ron!
Ivy Lewis,Ron!
Ivy Lewis,"Ron, play with us!"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Zoe Lewis,"Ron, play with us."
Ron Swanson,"Girls, Ron's got sharp tools now."
Zoe Lewis,"Oh, Ron!"
Joe,Ladies.
Joe,"Eyes are watching, ears are listening lips are closed, hands are still feet are very quiet you should really try it, listen well, listen well"
Ron Swanson,That was well played.
Joe,Children their age respond positively to melody and rhyme.
Joe,They are great girls.
Joe,You must feel very lucky to be their stepdad.
Ron Swanson,"I do, indeed."
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, Joe, I have to finish hogging out the cheeks on these lap joints."
Joe,"Oh, maybe you could use this jig I made."
Joe,It's just a hardwood clamping block connected to a small piece of hackberry.
Joe,You could use it to locate your cuts for the inside shoulder
Ron Swanson,Without having to reset the fence.
Joe,Without having to reset the fence.
Joe,Exactly.
Joe,Muffin?
April Ludgate,"Thirsty there, big guy?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Geez, yes."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Jerry Gergich,Do you remember the time when you put sleeping pills in my soda?
Jerry Gergich,I fell right over in the middle of a town hall meeting.
April Ludgate,"Mm, no."
April Ludgate,I don't remember that.
Jerry Gergich,You made a video of it and showed it at my birthday party.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, it went over really big."
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Jerry Gergich,That's very sweet.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, um, I have got an itch that I have not been able to get to all day, and even against the wall, nothing will do it."
Jerry Gergich,Would you mind doing that?
April Ludgate,"No, not at all."
Jerry Gergich,"Justâ¦ if you could, like okay, go up."
Jerry Gergich,Go up the back.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,Can I just please tell just April?
Andy Dwyer,I am hanging on by a thread over here.
Ben Wyatt,"No, justâ¦ look, everyone's healthy and fine, but it's complicated."
Ben Wyatt,There's a lot going on.
Ben Wyatt,"So just don't say anything to anyone about anything forever, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Andy?
Ben Wyatt,"You can say ""Okay."""
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't mean to say ""Bye."""
Leslie Knope,"Our next item up for bid is the naming rights for our children's tent, so let's start the bidding at 1,000 dollars, please."
Jeremy Jamm,I'll bid 100 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"Anyone want to-- Oh, thank you, madam."
Leslie Knope,A very wealthy and elegant looking woman with a diamond encrusted eye patch just raised her hand.
Leslie Knope,Don't look at her.
Leslie Knope,"She doesn't like attention, but she's there."
Leslie Knope,She's real.
Leslie Knope,"So do I hear 2,000?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, yeah, here we go."
Leslie Knope,The sheik has thrown his hat into the ring.
Leslie Knope,Well..

Leslie Knope,It looks like we've got a real bidding war between
Jeremy Jamm,There's no bidding war.
Jeremy Jamm,No one's talking
Leslie Knope,An elegant
Jeremy Jamm,"'Cause there's no sheik, and there's no old lady with a diamond what is it, a diamond eye patch?"
Leslie Knope,"3,000, says the gentleman"
Jeremy Jamm,"There's no 3,000."
Leslie Knope,With the crazy hat and a monkey on his shoulder.
Jeremy Jamm,It's 100 bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,It's my bid.
Leslie Knope,That is outrageous.
Jeremy Jamm,That's the only bid out there right now.
Jeremy Jamm,Naming rights for the kids' tent go to Jamm Orthodontics for 100 smackers.
Jeremy Jamm,Now that is the steal of the day.
Ben Wyatt,I think it's going great.
Ben Wyatt,You want a head massage?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So, um, Andy told me what's going on."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,I was trying to keep it hush-hush.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of embarrassing.
April Ludgate,"Well, if you ever need to talk to anyone, I'm here for you."
April Ludgate,"Or, like, you know, I'm here, standing near you."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, earlier today, I was licking icing off of my finger, and then, boom, I swallow my wedding ring."
Jerry Gergich,"And I wish I could say it was the first time, butâ¦"
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate,"So you're not, like, dying?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, I mean, can it be painful?"
Jerry Gergich,"Sure, but the good news is, I've gotten very good at passing it."
Jerry Gergich,It's just a matter of getting out the old colander.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pearl, jump in."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me pull the permits on your rental units.
Extra,"Hey, all the paperwork on those buildings are under my dog's name, so if you got a problem, take it up with Princess."
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, why don't you take a whale sounds break, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I'll finish this up.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, come on, now."
Ben Wyatt,This is signed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Ben Wyatt,"Just think about all their great songs, covering everything from the culture of Southern California to drug use in Southern California."
Herman,I'll bid 30 bucks.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This is easily worth 500 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, anyone."
Ben Wyatt,"We're just trying to raise some money for this concert, so no one gets stressed out."
Herman,Fine.
Herman,50 and another win for old Herman.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you erase the signatures?
Herman,I'm more of a Jack Johnson guy.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, give it back."
Herman,"If you want it so bad, bid on it."
Ben Wyatt,I don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Ben Wyatt,It's not even the original lineup.
Ben Wyatt,Give it back!
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,Stay relaxed.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, my God, there's blood everywhere."
Craig Middlebrooks,Call a doctor!
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, call a coroner!"
Craig Middlebrooks,It just got insane!
Dr. Harris,You have very weak hands.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you say that?
Dr. Harris,Just making an observation.
Leslie Knope,Poor Ben.
Leslie Knope,"You know the EMT said that if flea had sent you his bass, you could've lost a thumb."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm totally fine, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Everything is A-okay coolio beans.
Ben Wyatt,You want to meditate real quick?
Leslie Knope,"No, we do not have time."
Leslie Knope,We have a concert to save.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, he's feeling better."
Leslie Knope,"He can go, right, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'll ever stop doing that.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"I honestly don't care, but I'm just gonna say it."
Ron Swanson,I like Joe.
Ron Swanson,"He's a nice man who's good with kids, and he seems to be smart and patient."
Donna Meagle,I know.
Donna Meagle,That's why he's my Tammy.
Donna Meagle,I'm a social butterfly.
Donna Meagle,"When we're together, all we do is have sex, sit on the couch, eat homemade pasta, have sex again."
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Donna Meagle,"He's constantly being respectful, wanting to spend time with me, trying to ""connect"" with me."
Donna Meagle,It's a nightmare.
Donna Meagle,I become boring.
Ron Swanson,"Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness."
April Ludgate,"So I've been talking to Larry, and he's definitely not dying."
Andy Dwyer,"Technically, we're all dying, unless you choose the right grail."
Andy Dwyer,It's the dusty one.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I was nice to Larry."
April Ludgate,I scratched his back.
April Ludgate,I had a conversation with him.
April Ludgate,It was horrible.
April Ludgate,How can you do that to me?
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,I'll tell you the secret.
Andy Dwyer,Ben's dog is dying.
April Ludgate,Lie.
Andy Dwyer,Ben is dyingâ¦ he has the same disease Larry has.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie is dying.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,They're both dying.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dying.
Andy Dwyer,Chris and Ann are moving.
April Ludgate,They already moved.
Andy Dwyer,They're moving again to Chinatown in France.
April Ludgate,No!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, fine."
Andy Dwyer,Do you really want to know?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie is a spy.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Tom has something wrong with his butt.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,They need an encore.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, they wantthe kids want an encore, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,What song should we do?
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do Toots?
Joe,"I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you."
Joe,But you're still gonna want to go to a garage 'cause I don'tâ¦
Donna Meagle,I like to do things.
Joe,Excuse me.
Donna Meagle,"Museums, opera, nightclubs."
Donna Meagle,Sometimes I disappear for a day or two 'cause I'm flyfishing or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.
Donna Meagle,I promise not to cheat on you if you promise not to try to pin me down too fast.
Joe,I have no problem with that.
Donna Meagle,You can take me to dinner Friday.
Joe,"I have only one request-- that you wear that, uh, red thing."
Donna Meagle,I'll wear that red thing when you deserve to see me in that red thing.
Joe,Gotta go make some muffins.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we'll win the lottery.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus."
Ben Wyatt,We're screwed.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert."
Leslie Knope,It'll be fine.
Ben Wyatt,"No, not the concert."
Ben Wyatt,The triple cherries.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, of course it's the most amazing and wonderful thing to ever happen, but, okay, I am an accountant, and I am looking a cold, hard facts."
Ben Wyatt,Raising three kids is going to cost 2 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, our kids will be geniuses."
Leslie Knope,They'll get scholarships.
Leslie Knope,Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read.
Leslie Knope,It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize-- different time.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I have been trying so hard not to stress you out, but we just spent our entire savings account on a trip to Paris."
Ben Wyatt,What were we thinking?
Ben Wyatt,We spent too much money on macaroons.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, honey--"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, wait, what's the number for the Louvre? I mean, maybe I can get a refund."
Ben Wyatt,We barely looked at the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope,"Honey, can you just breathe for a second?"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, these numbers are going to determine everything for the rest of our lives!"
Leslie Knope,Breathe.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe we should move because we could make more money, or maybe we should stay here because it's cheaper to live here than in Chicago."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God! I'm shamwowing all of your stress, and there's no one here to wring me out."
Leslie Knope,Benjamin Wyatt
Ben Wyatt,I don't even know--
Leslie Knope,"The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we are in trouble here."
Ben Wyatt,We are in real trouble!
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"You just look so crazy right now, but cute."
Ben Wyatt,You're always stressed out.
Ben Wyatt,How are you calm right now?
Leslie Knope,Because I realized something.
Leslie Knope,"Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this."
Leslie Knope,I am immune to stress because I have you.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Ivy Lewis,Ron is King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
Ron Swanson,Much obliged.
Donna Meagle,So I'm going to dinner with Joe next week.
Ron Swanson,Glad to hear it.
Donna Meagle,It's always nice to see someone actually change for the better.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, Joe seems like a good man, but at this point, I'm done talking about him."
Donna Meagle,I was talking about you.
Donna Meagle,Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person.
Ron Swanson,You take that back.
Donna Meagle,"Come on, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,Did you think even two years ago you'd be playing matchmaker for me while wearing a glittery crown?
Donna Meagle,Now you're a dad.
Donna Meagle,"You care a little, itty bit about your friends."
Donna Meagle,You're King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
Donna Meagle,It suits you.
April Ludgate,"Andy, the camo is not working."
April Ludgate,I can see you.
Andy Dwyer,"Damn, really?"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Babe, you don't have to hide from me."
April Ludgate,"I don't care about the secret anymore, okay?"
April Ludgate,"I just thought, when we got married, we would share everything, but if you really can't tell me or whatever, it's fine."
April Ludgate,I trust you.
Andy Dwyer,"It's just that it's a really big secret, and for once, I wanted to keep my word."
Andy Dwyer,But screw it.
Andy Dwyer,You're more important than anything.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna tell you 'cause it's super juicy-- you ready?
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, if you could gather aroundâ¦"
Andy Dwyer,They're here-- don't try to get it out of me anymore.
Leslie Knope,The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Geez, I've been up all night trying to make sure--"
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter, Larry."
Leslie Knope,It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time.
Leslie Knope,The truth is I'm pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I did it! I kept a secret."
Ron Swanson,Congratulations.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you will both raise a wonderful child with whom I will profoundly disagree on nearly everything.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, actually, and this is crazy, but it's children, plural."
Leslie Knope,"We're having triplets, andâ¦"
Jerry Gergich,Shut the--
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,A little freaked out about it.
April Ludgate,That's amazing.
April Ludgate,"Babe, I am so glad you didn't tell me."
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I'm incredible.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now listen to me, you two."
