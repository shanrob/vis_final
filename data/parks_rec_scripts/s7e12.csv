Leslie Knope,Which brings us to 2005.
Leslie Knope,"The Circle Park renovation was complete, and a young man named Thomas Haverford was still two years away from getting hired."
Ron Swanson,"Perhaps we could skip ahead, and just hit the highlights?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I planned a comprehensive retrospective, but I guess I can just focus on the really important moments."
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,The debate about getting a pod-based coffee machine.
Leslie Knope,Garry and I wrote a little musical number about that.
Leslie Knope,And it goes a little something like this.
April Ludgate,"Why can't we just quickly shake hands, pretend we liked each other, and get out of here?"
Ron Swanson,I'm all for that.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, Ron, we need to celebrate everything that we've done together as a group."
Leslie Knope,This is our last day here.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when we'll all be together like this again?
Extra,Excuse me.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,There's a swing in a park near my house that's been broken for about three months.
Extra,Is it possible to get that fixed?
Andy Dwyer,"""Anything is possible, if you follow your dreams."""
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate.
Donna Meagle,Except getting a swing fixed.
Donna Meagle,None of us actually work here anymore.
Donna Meagle,Come back in two hours when the office is open.
Extra,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, sir, we can help."
Leslie Knope,"We can, and we will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when we used to work here, helping people was our job."
Leslie Knope,Forget about these old stories.
Leslie Knope,Let's make a new one.
Leslie Knope,Let's fix the swing.
Leslie Knope,One last ride for the Parks and Rec gang.
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
All,Yeah!
Jerry Gergich,The vote was four to three Donna said to get rid of me But Ron was suspicious Because my coffee was delicious--
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Garry."
Tom Haverford,You're the mayor now.
Tom Haverford,Have some dignity.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, what is our first step on our quest to help this man?"
Leslie Knope,Does anyone remember?
Jerry Gergich,A Parks and Recreation equipment requisition form.
Leslie Knope,Correct!
Leslie Knope,Five points for Hufflepuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everything is paperless now."
Ben Wyatt,And none of us has a login.
Ben Wyatt,So we can't access the computers.
Donna Meagle,Hang on.
Donna Meagle,I have one right here.
Donna Meagle,"Thanks to Leslie's scrapbook, ""Thanks Form the Memories""."
Leslie Knope,I knew those scrapbooks were going to come in handy.
Leslie Knope,You came through like you always do.
Leslie Knope,"God, I'm going to miss you."
Leslie Knope,"Your confidence, your joie de vivre."
Leslie Knope,That crazy story about you getting kicked out of En Vogue.
Donna Meagle,"Technically, I kicked them out."
Leslie Knope,When do you leave for Seattle?
Donna Meagle,Soon as I get my local real estate license.
Donna Meagle,"I'm married to a teacher, and I love the man, but I also love diamond watches."
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever happens, I know that you are going to live an exciting and full life."
Donna Meagle,"3400 square feet, a beautiful view of Puget Sound, and if you look out this window, you can watch them build the new Space Haystack around the Space Needle."
Extra,Wow.
Extra,I can hardly see the needle anymore.
Donna Meagle,"I know, that's kind of the point."
Donna Meagle,"So, what are we thinking?"
Joe,Wow.
Joe,It sold in two hours?
Donna Meagle,You cannot beat the Seattle real estate market.
Donna Meagle,"I think it's all that coffee and legal marijuana, has people wanting to buy houses quickly and irrationally."
Joe,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,But the giant commission check has me thinking aboutâ¦
Joe,Mmmhmm?
Donna Meagle,Donna Joe Adventure Quest.
Joe,Ooh!
Joe,Where are we going?
Joe,"Well, it can't beat last year."
Joe,"I mean, Middle Korea is so beautiful."
Donna Meagle,Here's my idea.
Donna Meagle,The Amazon.
Joe,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Three weeks of the best and most expensive places South America has to offer.
Joe,I love it.
Joe,"Honestly, with the way work is going, I just need this right now."
Joe,The school cut the math club.
Joe,And math.
Joe,They just don't teach math anymore.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,My poor little do-gooder teacher baby.
Donna Meagle,"Why don't we cuddle up on the couch, watch a movie, and then maybe later, I'll wear that little red thing?"
Joe,"Yes, the red thing."
Joe,"Here, let me get this."
Donna Meagle,Call Satan's Niece.
April Ludgate,"Hey, what do you want?"
Donna Meagle,And this is me DJing a boat party in Venezuela.
Donna Meagle,Kind of reminded me of the two weeks you and I spent there.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,That happened.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it did."
Joe,April!
Joe,What are you doing here?
Donna Meagle,"Babe, have a seat."
Joe,What's going on?
Donna Meagle,"Recently, I was thinking, for the millionth time, how lucky I am to have found you."
Donna Meagle,"So, I've decided to treat yo' self."
Joe,You're going to buy me a bunch of leather handbags?
April Ludgate,Donna is going to take some of the money you usually use on your trips and establish an education program through the foundation I work for.
Donna Meagle,It's called Teach Yo' Self.
Donna Meagle,And you and the other teachers will get money for afterschool programs.
Donna Meagle,"For music, art, math, whatever you want."
Joe,"Baby, this is really generous."
Joe,But I love our trips.
Joe,"And honestly, it's your money."
Joe,You should spend it how you want.
Donna Meagle,This is what I want.
Donna Meagle,I've had a lot of adventures.
Donna Meagle,I single-handedly started that doorknockers earring trend.
Donna Meagle,I came in ninth in Italy's Got Talent.
Joe,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,I served on a NASCAR pit crew.
Donna Meagle,"I want a new kind of adventure, and I want to take it with you."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I feel like it's time for me to get out of here."
Craig Middlebrooks,What is this mess?
Craig Middlebrooks,Why are you all in my office?
Leslie Knope,We are on one last mission to help the people of Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,"Craig, can you sign the requisition form?"
Ben Wyatt,It will speed things up.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Craig, when I first met you, I thought, ""There is a man who loves his job."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, wow, he's intense."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, no, he's insane."""
Leslie Knope,"""That person is psychotic, and I need to call the police."""
Craig Middlebrooks,"Yeah, that's usually the way it goes."
Leslie Knope,But I just think you've come so far.
Leslie Knope,And I'm so glad that we are leaving the Parks Department in your hands.
Craig Middlebrooks,Funny though it's true Those silly things you do They only bring me Closer to you
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"The gentleman over by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know--"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, fine."
Pastor,We are gathered here today to join Craig Middlebrooks and Typhoon Montalban in holy matrimony.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't know about this.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm very scared.
Typhoon,"Oh, just relax, you nervous nelly."
Craig Middlebrooks,You're right.
Craig Middlebrooks,"We love each other, and the tax break is substantial."
Pastor,Will the best man please present the rings?
Ron Swanson,"Good luck, you two."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Typhoon, my love, happy anniversary."
Craig Middlebrooks,Do you have any regrets?

Typhoon,Do you have any regrets?
Craig Middlebrooks,Are you kidding?
Craig Middlebrooks,Thousands!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Most recently, this trout!"
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, I need to file this."
Leslie Knope,Would anyone like to accompany me to the fourth floor?
April Ludgate,One last journey to the weirdest place on earth?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun!
Leslie Knope,We're just taking the elevator.
Andy Dwyer,I get to push buttons.
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,He called it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,I heard.
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,"We need this filed, please."
Ethel Beavers,We've gone digital.
Ethel Beavers,"Get with the times, you Luddite."
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"Of all the places in Pawnee, I'm going to miss the fourth floor the most."
April Ludgate,"The disturbing murals, the ominous lighting, the creepy people."
Kyle,"Hi, April."
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to miss the food in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut."
Andy Dwyer,"But most of all, I'm going to miss you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Andy, all of those things, including me, will still be with you in Washington."
Andy Dwyer,That is a beautiful sentiment.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say that we are about to embark on an amazing adventure.
Leslie Knope,"And whatever happens, just know that Ben and I are always there for you."
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,"Agent Macklin, I need you."
April Ludgate,Some thieves are trying to steal the legendary Snakehole Sapphire.
Andy Dwyer,What the... No!
Andy Dwyer,That sapphire has the power to activate the Cuban Missile Crisis.
April Ludgate,"Damn it, Macklin, I love it when you take charge."
April Ludgate,"Make love to me, you fool!"
April Ludgate,You animal!
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Raincheck that, all right?"
Andy Dwyer,They're here.
All,Trick or treat!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look at them!"
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, you little monsters!"
Andy Dwyer,I love this.
Andy Dwyer,You guys are the best.
April Ludgate,"My love, we have to go."
April Ludgate,Just put all the candy in a bowl or something.
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
April Ludgate,Did you eat all the candy?
Andy Dwyer,No!
April Ludgate,Did you?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, but that's not what's wrong."
Andy Dwyer,It's just... Seeing all those kids out there... Babe.
Andy Dwyer,"I want to put a babe in you, babe."
April Ludgate,"Andy, you know where I stand on this."
April Ludgate,"Yes, I would love all the awesome stuff my body would go through."
April Ludgate,"I mean, if all it meant was puking and getting weird stretch marks and veins everywhere, then sign me up."
April Ludgate,"But at the end, we've brought a child into the world?"
April Ludgate,That's disgusting.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,They wipe all of the disgusting stuff off of it immediately.
April Ludgate,We're going to be late for dinner.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Always nice to see Janet Snakehole and Burt Macklin in the mix.
April Ludgate,What are you guys dressed as?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor."
Leslie Knope,Get it?
Leslie Knope,Sandra Dee plus Sandra Day O'Connor?
April Ludgate,Who's Sandra Dee?
Andy Dwyer,Who's Sandra Day O'Connor?
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Ben Wyatt,"And I am the Lamplighter, a character from my new board game sequel, Cones of Dunshire, Winds of Tremorrah."
Ben Wyatt,"Gameplay Magazine called it ""punishingly intricate."""
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, where are the kids at?"
Andy Dwyer,I want to say hi and wrestle all three of them at once.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, they're trick-or-treating in Georgetown with some friends."
Ben Wyatt,It's just us grownups tonight.
Ben Wyatt,No kids at all.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Andy, why don't you give me a hand in the kitchen?"
Andy Dwyer,So?
Andy Dwyer,What do you need a hand with?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I just thought you might want to talk."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that's really slick."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, that's some secret agent stuff right there."
Ben Wyatt,"So, April's still on the fence about kids, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and I'm freaking out, man."
Andy Dwyer,I want kids so bad.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, yesterday, I was at the park, and I saw this group of eight year olds laughing and playing and having a good time."
Andy Dwyer,I almost started crying.
Andy Dwyer,"Granted, I had just faceplanted on my rollerblades."
Andy Dwyer,That's what they were laughing at.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
April Ludgate,"All right, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,What?
April Ludgate,You're going to lecture me about how Andy and I should have kids.
April Ludgate,"You're going to be like, ""They're so great."""
April Ludgate,"""They change your life."""
April Ludgate,"""And yes, they drive you nuts, but it's all worth it for the beauty and the majesty and the glory of their little faces in the morning."""
April Ludgate,"Blah, blah, blah and barf."
April Ludgate,You know why it's so unfair?
April Ludgate,Because you guys got so lucky.
April Ludgate,"You had sex one time and you had three kids and they're all, like, smart and great and healthy."
April Ludgate,"And now, your lives are perfect."
April Ludgate,But our life is pretty perfect already.
April Ludgate,And you know what?
April Ludgate,Kids act the opposite of their parents.
April Ludgate,That's why your kids are so cool.
April Ludgate,"But Andy and I are cool already, so our kids will be, like, really lame and weird."
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,I just don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,Please tell me what to do.
April Ludgate,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,It's not about trying to make your life perfect.
Leslie Knope,Nobody's lives are perfect.
Leslie Knope,"You have kids because you and Andy are a team, and you want to bring in some new team members."
April Ludgate,"So, you think we should?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know if you should have kids.
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,But I do like your team.
Dr. Saperstein,"All right, Ms. Ludgate."
Dr. Saperstein,We're getting close.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look more beautiful right now than I have ever seen you."
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,Just your luck that you're going into labor on Halloween.
Dr. Saperstein,Can I get a warm towel to get that makeup off?
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,I want it on.
April Ludgate,That's the whole point.
April Ludgate,I put the makeup on after I went into labor.
Dr. Saperstein,Whatever blows your skirt up.
Dr. Saperstein,Okay.
Dr. Saperstein,You ready to push?
April Ludgate,"Wait, no, babe, my birth mix."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Music,He did the mash
Dr. Saperstein,Here comes a contraction.
Dr. Saperstein,Are you ready?
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm ready."
April Ludgate,Let's do this.
Music,It was a graveyard smash He did the mash It caught on in a flash He did the mash He did the monster mash From the laboratory in the castle east
Andy Dwyer,Burt Macklin Junior?
April Ludgate,"Mmm, we need a Halloween angle."
April Ludgate,How about Demon Spawn Baby Satan Dwyer?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I like that."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe, Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jacko'Lantern Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,We call him Jack for short.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I want to scream, but I don't want to wake up my godchild."
Leslie Knope,"I'm assuming it's my godchild, right?"
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it later.
Ben Wyatt,"Congrats, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"I know it came unexpectedly early, but pretty cool he was born in Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Where do I put these?
Ben Wyatt,"I have so many presents, it's weird."
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, for the baby?"
Andy Dwyer,Just put them over there.
Leslie Knope,What's his name?
April Ludgate,Jack.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to the team, little guy."
Ethel Beavers,Take this down to maintenance.
Leslie Knope,"I know just where to take it, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,And I know just the person who should accompany me.
Kyle,I'm a little busy right now.
Leslie Knope,"Not you, Kyle."
Leslie Knope,"How many times did you and I deliver a form to maintenance, just like this?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so many great conversations, bonding and mentoring moments."
Leslie Knope,It seems only right that we make this journey one final time.
Tom Haverford,"What was that, booboo?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ohhh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tommy T and Sexy Lexy Knope.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What are you two bad Larrys up to?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is our last day in Pawnee and we have one last problem to fix."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're leaving?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,For truth?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I am going to miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,You're not injured?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh, yeah, I'm injured."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I got a terminal case of ""get me to the front of the line at Six Flags!"""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shaboosh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's a winter wonderland!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm going to be so sad to see you go.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Will you do me one final kindness?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Will you pretend to be my wife for an insurance scam, but then we fall in love for real?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Also, can I have a pair of your gym socks?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And don't worry.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's not for anything weird.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's just a fetish I have.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Although I truly hope that I never see you again, I do wish you a long and happy life."
Extra,Today we say goodbye to Jean-Ralphio Saperstein.
Extra,"As per his last will and testament, we will now listen to his favorite song, Bend Over, by Lil Jon featuring Tyga."
Music,Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Whoo!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, okay, they bought it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,They bought it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have the insurance money?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"No doubt, no doubt."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Let's hit it, bro."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Time to start a casino in Uh, Tajikistan"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Tajikistan!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Talking about Tajikistan!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Shh, shh, shh."
Extra,Jean-Ralphio?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Go!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Go, go, go, go!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Leslie Knope,So Tom and I have a swing to fix.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Leslie?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I've always loved you.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man, I forgot that maintenance was closed on Fridays."
Tom Haverford,What would our last ride be without one more bureaucratic snafu?
Tom Haverford,"Don't worry, booboo."
Tom Haverford,"Tommy will solve this problem, no sweat."
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, Tom, you have accomplished so much, you have come so far, now you're so successful"
Tom Haverford,Don't forget well-dressed.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and well-dressed."
Leslie Knope,I am so very proud of you.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"I'm proud of me, too."
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, the gentleman by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know, Tom's Bistro has been presented with a huge expansion opportunity, and I don't want to make a decision until I hear from my senior advisory board."
Tom Haverford,"So, is this a good idea?"
Tom Haverford,Accounting Nerd.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a congressman, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Can you at least call me Ben?
Tom Haverford,"No can do, Accounting Nerd."
Tom Haverford,We all knew you before you were a big shot.
Tom Haverford,Let's keep the whining to a minimum.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there are always going to be risks when you open new restaurants."
Ben Wyatt,But you've done your homework.
Ben Wyatt,All the numbers line up.
Ben Wyatt,"Side note, I would again strongly recommend adding calzones to the menu."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,The worst.
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Ron Swanson,"It's a bold capitalistic gambit, son."
Ron Swanson,"But nothing ventured, nothing gained."
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle?
Donna Meagle,Real estate is pretty cheap right now.
Donna Meagle,"If you're going to do it, this is a good time."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I'm doing it.
Tom Haverford,"Over the next five years, there's going to be 20 Tom's Bistros across America."
Tom Haverford,"Look out, world."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's about to blow up.
Tom Haverford,"And blow up he did, but not in a good way."
Tom Haverford,He lost everything.
Tom Haverford,"Today, Tom Haverford is broke, destitute."
Tom Haverford,"And worst of all, swaggerless."
Lucy,"Tommy, you've got to stop watching this."
Tom Haverford,I can't tear myself away.
Tom Haverford,It's a whole documentary about my failures.
Lucy,That you made!
Tom Haverford,I had to.
Tom Haverford,I have to remember every tiny awful aspect of this.
Tom Haverford,"I lost everything, Lucy."
Tom Haverford,"The franchises, most of my money-- I had to sell my pocket square collection!"
Tom Haverford,What are people's eyes going to be drawn to?
Lucy,"Look, you had a tough break."
Lucy,"The stock market tanked, credit dried up."
Lucy,Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?
Lucy,You've just got to move on.
Tom Haverford,"That's the problem, though."
Tom Haverford,"I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless."
Tom Haverford,"This time, I was smart and careful, and I still went broke."
Tom Haverford,What do I do now?
Lucy,"Well, you and I are going to be fine."
Lucy,And you'll come up with a new idea.
Lucy,You always do.
Tom Haverford,I once started an entertainment company. It failed in four months.
Tom Haverford,I opened a clothing rental store.
Tom Haverford,I built a restaurant empire.
Tom Haverford,They all failed.
Tom Haverford,But the story of America isn't about second or third chances.
Tom Haverford,"It's about fourth, fifth, sixth, twentieth, fiftieth chances."
Tom Haverford,That's how long it took me to get where I am today.
Tom Haverford,"Best selling author of Failure, An American Success Story."
Tom Haverford,"As you know if you've read the book, I've outlined seven different types of successful people."
Tom Haverford,You can be an Andy.
Tom Haverford,An April.
Tom Haverford,A Ben.
Tom Haverford,A Leslie.
Tom Haverford,A Ron.
Tom Haverford,A Donna.
Tom Haverford,Or my personal favorite.
Tom Haverford,A Tom.
Tom Haverford,But what do we definitely not want to be?
All,A Garry!
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,Do not be a Garry.
Jerry Gergich,He's talking about me.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Thanks so much for coming, guys."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is incredible."
Leslie Knope,"A bestselling book, a 40 city tour."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I couldn't have done it without you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the book is called Failure."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to take that.
Tom Haverford,I'm serious.
Tom Haverford,You guys have always supported me.
Tom Haverford,"Here, I inscribed you a copy."
Ben Wyatt,"""When I think of success, I think of you."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You are a true inspiration to me."""
Ben Wyatt,"""I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, sorry, that's actually for Kendrick Lamar."
Tom Haverford,Here's yours.
Leslie Knope,"""Best wishes."""
Tom Haverford,And I mean every word of it.
Leslie Knope,"So, how are we going to fix this swing?"
Leslie Knope,Hold a public forum?
Leslie Knope,Have a rally?
Leslie Knope,Smash that door and do some looting?
Tom Haverford,"Actually, I think there's a simpler solution."
Tom Haverford,We just need the help of the most powerful man in Pawnee.
Jerry Gergich,"Jim, how the heck are you?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, look, I hate to bother you, but I'm here with my two best friends, Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Jerry Gergich,And we need the first floor maintenance room open.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, great."
Jerry Gergich,And best to Louise and the girls.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, bye bye."
Jerry Gergich,You guys are all set.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mayor Gergich."
Leslie Knope,You really saved our butts.
Leslie Knope,I am so happy that you get to be mayor.
Leslie Knope,Are you enjoying yourself?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, are you kidding me?"
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I know that this is purely ceremonial and it will be over in just a couple of weeks, but I just don't know how my life could get any better than this."
Perd Hapley,"In a turn of events both shocking and unexpected, interim mayor Garry Gergich was officially elected today, thanks to a massive write-in campaign."
Perd Hapley,"Mayor Gergich, what are your plans for your first actual term?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, geez."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, you know what, I have no idea, Perd."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, this is so crazy."
Jerry Gergich,"I just hope I do a good job, and I promise I'm going to try my best."
Jerry Gergich,"And faithfully serve the people of Pawnee, Indiana."
Brandi Maxxxx,"As President of City Council, I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx, star of more than 11,000 adult films in the last two years, officially declare Garry Gergich Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana, for the fourth time."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Morris,"Okay, great."
Morris,"Garry Gergich, you are now mayor, again, for the tenth time, proving conclusively that in these corporate states of America, it's the entrenched powers who hold all the cards."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Councilman Morris."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Gayle Gergich,"Happy birthday, my sweet, sweet husband."
Gayle Gergich,We all love you so much.
Jerry Gergich,I have had the perfect life.
Jerry Gergich,I have had the perfect marriage.
Gayle Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,The perfect children and the perfect grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Jerry Gergich,And I just want you to know how much I love you.
Gayle Gergich,Okay.
Gayle Gergich,"Come on, everybody."
Gayle Gergich,"Say ""Gergich."""
All,Gergich!
Extra,"Mayor Garry Gergich died peacefully, in his sleep, on his 100th birthday, holding the hand of his beloved wife, Gayle."
Ben Wyatt,"Man, Gayle looks amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Extra,"He will now be given the Indiana Notary Society's highest honor, the 21 Stamp Salute."
Leslie Knope,"Rest in peace, friend."
Ben Wyatt,They spelled his name wrong on the tombstone.
Leslie Knope,Close enough.
Ben Wyatt,Eh.
Extra,It's time to go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How's this for a headline?
Leslie Knope,"""Still Swinging: Parks Gang Reunites for One Last Bang."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,That's a little dirty.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a headline, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Sex sells.
Ron Swanson,Knope.
Ron Swanson,Make yourself useful and hand me that crescent wrench.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Not bad craftsmanship, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It is perfect craftsmanship.
Ron Swanson,I calculate the cost of my labor at 38 dollars.
Ron Swanson,I can send the bill to you?
Leslie Knope,"So, you think you're going to stick around Pawnee?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I imagine so."
Ron Swanson,"Not sure where I would go, really."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're going to come back here a lot."
Leslie Knope,You know what they say.
Leslie Knope,Don't be a stranger.
Trevor Nelson,"Despite the recent financial crisis, Very Good Building Company will finish fiscal year 2022 in excellent financial shape, thanks in large part to the stewardship of your chairman, Ron Swanson."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Chairman, would you like to say a few words?"
Ron Swanson,I resign as chairman.
Ron Swanson,Effective immediately.
Trevor Nelson,"Uh, would you like to explain why?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Don Swanson,Should we discuss your retirement package?
Ron Swanson,Just give me whatever the Board thinks is fair.
Don Swanson,Agreed.
Vaughn Swanson,Best of luck.
Ron Swanson,"Don't get emotional, Vaughn."
Ron Swanson,You're embarrassing yourself.
Trevor Nelson,What just happened?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family is beautiful."
Ron Swanson,They are a handsome bunch.
Ron Swanson,"Diane and I are especially proud, because Ivy was just accepted at Stanford University."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,It's going to cost an arm and a leg.
Ben Wyatt,Did you take my advice?
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,Thank you again.
Ron Swanson,"I sold some of my gold, and officially diversified my portfolio."
Extra,Congratulations.
Extra,You now own 51% of the Lagavulin Distillery.
Ron Swanson,Pleasure doing business with you.
Extra,And with you.
Ron Swanson,Slainte.
All,Slainte.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, what brings you here?"
Ron Swanson,I am at something of a personal crossroads.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I love personal crossroads.
Ron Swanson,"I once made the mistake of not talking to you at such a moment, and I do not intend to repeat that error."
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's take a walk."
Leslie Knope,There's a cute little park nearby.
Ron Swanson,"I suppose I had simply accomplished everything I wanted to, and there seemed to be little point in continuing."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to do now?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's the problem."
Ron Swanson,I am not sure.
Ron Swanson,My kids are growing up.
Ron Swanson,My days in an office feel like a waste.
Ron Swanson,I would like to turn my attention to something that would make me feel useful.
Ron Swanson,"But for the life of me, I cannot figure out what."
Ron Swanson,"And there are not many people-- I mean, we were workplace proximity acquaintances for many years."
Ron Swanson,"And so, I thought I thought, maybeâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Say no more, you big softie."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to spend every waking moment trying to figure this out for you.
Leslie Knope,You want to stay for dinner?
Leslie Knope,We're having steak.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,But we're also hosting several members of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs.
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that steak to go, please and thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for meeting me here.
Ron Swanson,"Well, if you'd held them here instead of that conference room, I would have come to more meetings."
Ron Swanson,"I've got to tell you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Establishing this national park right next to Pawnee is quite an accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,This is a fine piece of land you saved.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to run it?
Leslie Knope,"The superintendent of Bryce Canyon retired, and I convinced the superintendent of this park to transfer, shuffled a few things around."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, someone needs to take care of this place now."
Leslie Knope,Thought it should be you.
Ron Swanson,"I... Well, first of all, I would be working for the federal government--"
Leslie Knope,Your job would be to walk around the land alone.
Leslie Knope,You'd live in the same town you've always lived in.
Leslie Knope,"You'd work outside, you'd talk to bears."
Leslie Knope,Next argument.
Ron Swanson,"Well, there must be dozens of people gunning for this job."
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't want you to ruffle any feathers.
Ron Swanson,Am I even qualified?
Leslie Knope,"Well, a few people might be annoyed."
Leslie Knope,But they'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,"And as far as your qualifications, you're Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Stop being a dummy and accept.
Ron Swanson,When do I start?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, today."
Leslie Knope,I already accepted for you.
Leslie Knope,I still remember how to forge your signature.
Leslie Knope,Let's go meet your staff.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss."
Ron Swanson,Rangers.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Your job, and mine, is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it."
Ron Swanson,"If you show up on time, speak honestly, and treat everyone with fairness, we will get along just fine."
Ron Swanson,"Though hopefully not too fine, as I am not looking for any new friends."
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Leslie Knope,Well said.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"You're welcome, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Time to go to work.
Music,"Laugh with me, buddy Jest with me, buddy Don't let her get the best of me, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have to make a couple more adjustments."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I don't want to seem dramatic, but I have just reconsidered every decision that we have made over the last year and I think we need to stay in Pawnee forever."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,But we have to pick up the kids and we have a flight to catch.
Leslie Knope,But when is this group of people ever going to be all together again?
Leslie Knope,That's all I want.
Leslie Knope,All of these people in the same place at the same time.
Ben Wyatt,It will happen.
Ben Wyatt,Someday.
Leslie Knope,What's going to happen between now and then?
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
Ben Wyatt,And it's all going to be great.
Leslie Knope,You promise?
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,This is a nice house.
Leslie Knope,You say that every time we're here.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just trying to distract you, so you don't have a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,I think I am past that point.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to worry about me anymore.
Joe Biden,"Hey, folks."
Joe Biden,Welcome back.
Joe Biden,Great to have so many good friends and colleagues.
Joe Biden,We're looking forward to a great conversation and a good dinner.
Jill Biden,"As usual, there is only one rule."
Jill Biden,No shop talk.
Jill Biden,"So, if you want to discuss politics, you're going to have to wait until after dinner."
Jill Biden,"I'm looking at you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, as long as we get to play charades later."
Joe Biden,Okay.
Joe Biden,"Last time we played charades, she spent three and a half hours here."
Jill Biden,You're just mad because you lost.
Joe Biden,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Damn, that food was good."
Leslie Knope,I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Leslie Knope,Joe Biden knows his way around a seafood risotto.
Extra,You've said that before?
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point is, yes, I do like working at Interior."
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,But I'm always looking for new challenges.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Extra,There's a rumor the Governor of Indiana isn't going to run again.
Extra,And my friends at the DNC are very interested in you as a candidate.
Leslie Knope,For governor of Indiana?
Extra,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Someone's been reading my kindergarten dream journal.
Extra,"So, what do you think?"
Extra,I'll call you next week and we can talk about it?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is exciting."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to take this energy and I'm going to go crush Joe Biden in charades.
Leslie Knope,Dr. Jill?
Leslie Knope,Let's pick teams.
Jennifer Barkley,Oh.
Jennifer Barkley,Move.
Jennifer Barkley,Need the congressman.
Jennifer Barkley,This is time sensitive.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Jen, I didn't know you were here."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm everywhere.
Jennifer Barkley,You want to be governor of Indiana?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,Colquitt is not going to run again.
Jennifer Barkley,"It's a rumor for now, but my gut says it's for real."
Jennifer Barkley,You're the perfect candidate.
Jennifer Barkley,"Local hero, state government experience."
Jennifer Barkley,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, the only potential problem is that devastatingly nerdy Cones of Dunshire thing."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, that's a problem?"
Jennifer Barkley,Mmm.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but it's the ninth highest selling multiplayer figurine based strategy fantasy sequel game in history."
Ben Wyatt,Please don't bail on me because of what just happened.
Leslie Knope,So I had a pretty interesting conversation with Janet from the DNC tonight.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,That kind of sucks.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, Jen Barkley kind of approached me about running."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, obviouslyâ¦"
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, obviously, weâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Pros of you running for governor.
Leslie Knope,You would be a great governor.
Leslie Knope,We could make Pawnee our home base.
Leslie Knope,The kids could go to school in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it would be a huge career move for you.
Leslie Knope,The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the same list.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Leslie Knope,The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.
Leslie Knope,And vice versa.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"So, we've solved it."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,We're going back to Pawnee in a week.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just talk about it after that?
Ben Wyatt,Good idea.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, maybe we can drop by the old stomping grounds."
Ben Wyatt,See how the Parks Department has changed.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?"
Leslie Knope,Kids!
Leslie Knope,Dinner!
Kid,"Hey, I'm going to eat in my room because I have to study."
Kid,Can we go to Bobby's house to watch the game?
Kid,Have you finished your homework?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't forget"
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your ice skates.
Leslie Knope,You have a lesson tomorrow.
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Ben Wyatt,Want some broccoli?
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we need fresh eyes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, other people to weigh in."
Leslie Knope,We should talk to Ron.
Leslie Knope,Or Tom.
Leslie Knope,Or April.
Leslie Knope,Or Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Or Andy, even."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, he can be wise."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, good idea."
Ben Wyatt,Let's call them.
Ben Wyatt,Or you know what else we could do?
Ben Wyatt,Just talk to them in person.
Andy Dwyer,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Ben Wyatt,"It's what you wanted, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone in the same room, at the same time."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you.
Leslie Knope,We're all here together in the same room.
Leslie Knope,In this room.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could be happier right now.
Ben Wyatt,Want to bet?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Ann's here.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Good.
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ann's here."
Ben Wyatt,Should we move away from here?
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, this could go on for some time."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"Your hair looks amazing, by the way."
Leslie Knope,You look like a cartoon princess.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thank you."
Ann Perkins,It's from the pills I was telling you about.
Leslie Knope,"I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach."
Ann Perkins,"No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight."
Ann Perkins,Not eat them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious."
Tom Haverford,"Because my first book was such a smash, I had to come up with a new angle for the follow-up."
Tom Haverford,"Then, it hit me, Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail."
Donna Meagle,Love it.
Tom Haverford,How's everything? You properly treating yo' self out there in Seattle?
Donna Meagle,In a manner of speaking.
Donna Meagle,Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe you went non-profit.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for."
Tom Haverford,You've changed.
Donna Meagle,Maybe you're right.
Donna Meagle,"By the way, what time is it? Oh, it looks like it's half past spla-dow!"
Tom Haverford,What? I take it all back.
Tom Haverford,That's a lot of diamonds.
Tom Haverford,"Gimme, gimme, gimme."
April Ludgate,"Hey, Oliver."
April Ludgate,"Hey, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"Hello, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, April."
April Ludgate,"Your kids are, like, surprisingly awesome."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Did you use an egg donor, or give Chris a hall pass for a night?"
Ann Perkins,"Once again, they are my biological children."
April Ludgate,"Once again, I don't believe you."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you opalescent tree shark."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you are the master of the metaphor."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Chris Traeger,I recently compared her to a nutrient-rich chia seed.
Leslie Knope,What's that thing on your wrist?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Extra,You are extremely healthy.
Chris Traeger,I do that literally 50 times a day.
Leslie Knope,Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer?
Chris Traeger,"Well, I am now."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, there he is."
Andy Dwyer,Chip Traeger.
Andy Dwyer,You old son of a gun.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, it's Chris."
Andy Dwyer,Is it? Huh.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Jack."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Strong handshake.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, you two."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,"So, are you going to have another one?"
April Ludgate,Um Shh.
Andy Dwyer,Shh.
Andy Dwyer,'Cause 'Cause he's sleeping? How can you tell?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's a common misconception that the Oculus holds all of the power."
Ben Wyatt,It's actually the Lamplighter.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's happening! It's totally happening.
Leslie Knope,Our kids are falling in love.
Ann Perkins,This is good.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, remember."
Ann Perkins,"If this is ever going to work, we have to pretend to disapprove."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, no."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Chris Traeger,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, is literally the greatest city that I have ever lived in."
Chris Traeger,But Pawnee is better.
Chris Traeger,"So, we're moving back."
Ben Wyatt,That's great.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,I'm going to run admissions at Indiana.
Chris Traeger,I'm trading Wolverines for Hoosiers.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you're getting the better end of that deal."
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,I took the quiz in your book about what kind of person I am.
Ron Swanson,I'm a Ron.
Tom Haverford,"Ha! I'm usually a Tom, but sometimes, I'm a Donna."
Ben Wyatt,"Last time I took it, I was a Tom."
Tom Haverford,What? No.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no! Take it again."
Tom Haverford,I've got to go recalibrate the quiz.
Ben Wyatt,"So, did anyone have any insights on our ""running for governor"" situation?"
Leslie Knope,"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me neither."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what I think."
Leslie Knope,I hate when we're on opposite sides.
Leslie Knope,It stinks.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.
Ben Wyatt,"So, all that matters is that we are good."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Which is why I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,I think we should flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,I mean it.
Leslie Knope,Let's literally flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.
Leslie Knope,"And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need."
Leslie Knope,"So, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,So let's flip a coin.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists."
Ben Wyatt,You want to leave this to chance?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together."
Leslie Knope,"So, let's go tell everybody."
Leslie Knope,"And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America."
Leslie Knope,"And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.
All,What?
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, Knope."
April Ludgate,That's amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win."
Ben Wyatt,"Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal."
Ben Wyatt,Just makes sense.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm running for governor."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car."
Leslie Knope,"But right now, I'd like to make a toast."
Leslie Knope,"When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better."
Leslie Knope,That's what public service is all about.
Leslie Knope,"Small, incremental change, every day."
Leslie Knope,"Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."""
Leslie Knope,And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.
Leslie Knope,"I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor."
Leslie Knope,"And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me."
Leslie Knope,"Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work."
Leslie Knope,Not to say that public service isn't sexy.
Leslie Knope,Because it definitely is.
Leslie Knope,But that's not why we do it.
Leslie Knope,"We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love."
Leslie Knope,"So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor."
Leslie Knope,"Now, go find your team, and get to work."
Extra,"In addition to Governor Knope's honorary doctorate from the School of Public Policy, in recognition of all she has done for the people of Indiana, the campus library will henceforth bear her name."
Leslie Knope,A [bleep] library?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, that should do it."
Ron Swanson,The swing is fixed!
Leslie Knope,"Well, there you have it, sir."
Leslie Knope,Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.
Extra,"Okay, great."
Extra,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's about right."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Jerry Gergich,Hang on.
Jerry Gergich,"Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture, just for old times' sake."
Leslie Knope,Good idea! Garry had a good idea.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,The lighting is all wrong.
Tom Haverford,I'm going to send you a glamor shot.
Tom Haverford,Just photoshop me in later.
April Ludgate,"I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.D.?"
April Ludgate,Where did you get that?
Andy Dwyer,Found it in the sandbox.
April Ludgate,Ew.
Donna Meagle,Go Macklin.
Donna Meagle,Macklin's the hottest.
Ron Swanson,Get on with it.
Ron Swanson,I can't hold this smile forever.
Ron Swanson,I look ridiculous.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, hang on."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"You ready, babe?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I'm ready.
Extra,That is a series wrap on Parks and Recreation.
