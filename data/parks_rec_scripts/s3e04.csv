Jack Cooper,Ron?
Jack Cooper,"Jack Cooper, from the Controller's Office."
Jack Cooper,Got a second?
Ron Swanson,"Sure, what can I do you for?"
Jack Cooper,"Frankly, this is a little awkward."
Jack Cooper,We've received this letter from a collection agency about an outstanding debt from the Pawnee Public Library.
Jack Cooper,It appears you have an overdue book.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, do I?"
Jack Cooper,"It's not the size of the boat, embracing Life with a Micropenis."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing okay.
Ron Swanson,"And if I am, she tries to everything up."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send."
Ron Swanson,You're worrying over nothing.
Leslie Knope,"If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free."
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,She's flashing a whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tammy."
Tammy 2,Oh!
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,I didn't see you come in.
Tammy 2,I was just checking myself for scoliosis.
Ron Swanson,And?
Tammy 2,Straight as an arrow.
Tammy 2,Just like somebody else I know.
Tammy 2,Jerky?
Ron Swanson,Call off the dogs.
Ron Swanson,"You and I both know that in my entire adult life, I have never checked a book out of the library."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, she's amazing."
Tammy 2,Ooh!
Tammy 2,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,I admit there was a time when that sort of behavior would've driven me wild.
Ron Swanson,"But I am in a healthy relationship now, Tammy."
Tammy 2,A relationship?
Tammy 2,With whom?
Ron Swanson,"A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy."
Tammy 2,Sounds like a real whore.
Ron Swanson,Clear the late charges and cut the crap.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Tammy 2,"Good day, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Good Good day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings."
Andy Dwyer,"Sausage, onion, and peppers."
Andy Dwyer,Scientifically proven to be the best toppings.
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Ben Wyatt,Should we throw in some salads for a healthy option?
Tom Haverford,"Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas."
Leslie Knope,So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does."
Leslie Knope,And they do.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, how about some calzones?"
Leslie Knope,Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,"They're dumb, and so was that idea."
Ben Wyatt,Seriously?
Tom Haverford,This is embarrassing for you.
Wendy,Sorry to interrupt.
Wendy,"Ron, are you ready?"
Ron Swanson,"Absolutely, my dear."
Ron Swanson,"I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Ron's girlfriend's pretty.
Andy Dwyer,Tom's ex-wife.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to see them together.
Tom Haverford,It's like they're rubbing it in my face.
Tom Haverford,All I can think about is Captain Mustache plowing my exwife.
Andy Dwyer,And you imagine he's wearing a cape while he's plowing her?
Tom Haverford,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, just, Captain Mustache?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if all you can think of is Ron, you know... Maybe put him in some tights and a cape, and then it would be funny."
Tom Haverford,Now I'm imagining a cape.
Chris Traeger,April?
April Ludgate,Did you call me?
Chris Traeger,I did call you.
Chris Traeger,Good ears.
April Ludgate,"Chris's assistant went back to Indianapolis, so he's borrowing me for a few days."
April Ludgate,Yay!
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to get me some more Postits.
Chris Traeger,I'd like them in multiple colors.
Chris Traeger,I'd like green.
Chris Traeger,I'd like yellow.
Chris Traeger,Do not buy orange.
Chris Traeger,I do not want orange.
Chris Traeger,I have plenty of orange.
April Ludgate,Got it.
April Ludgate,You want five million orange Postits.
Chris Traeger,That's hilarious.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait!"
Chris Traeger,I have a Postit for you.
Chris Traeger,"It says, ""Great job!"""
Chris Traeger,Great job.
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Wendy,"They're getting really old, and I'm an only child."
Wendy,I just feel like the right thing to do is to move back home.
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry to see you go.
Ron Swanson,I've really come to think of you as a companion.
Wendy,"Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to move to Canada?"
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't suppose I would."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I hate to nag, but shouldn't we be talking strategy, like, when to ask the chief for this huge critical favor?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I know exactly when we should do it.
Leslie Knope,"Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer."
Leslie Knope,"He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk."
Leslie Knope,Should be around 9:00.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you've thought this through."
Leslie Knope,Just sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'll get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Can I have two beers, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you okay?"
Ron Swanson,Wendy and I are over.
Ron Swanson,She's moving back to Canada.
Ron Swanson,It's too bad.
Ron Swanson,I just taught her how to whittle.
Ron Swanson,She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped."
Leslie Knope,Men are dogs.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,That does not apply to this situation at all.
Ron Swanson,But thank you.
Ron Swanson,I appreciate it.
Chris Traeger,This is a disaster.
Chris Traeger,You're not into football?
Chris Traeger,I knew there was something wrong with you.
Chris Traeger,I knew it.
Chris Traeger,"I knew it, knew it, knew it."
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years."
Ann Perkins,And it's not just because of the supplements he has me taking and the soluble fiber and the increase in regularity.
Ann Perkins,It's him.
Ann Perkins,"He's moving back to Indianapolis in a couple of weeks, which sucks."
Ann Perkins,"But if he asked me to move with him, I think I would."
Chris Traeger,I would like a local beer.
Chris Traeger,I'd like it in a bottle.
Chris Traeger,I'd like the bottle to be cold.
Ann Perkins,I would like a glass of white wine.
Ann Perkins,I would like it to be chardonnay.
Ann Perkins,And I would like that with one ice cube.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Chief Trumple?
Chief Trumple,"Hey, Knope."
Leslie Knope,You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Chief Trumple,"Yeah, how's it going?"
Chief Trumple,Thanks for the party.
Chief Trumple,Good pizza.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"So, yeah, the pizza's dynamite, isn't it?"
Chief Trumple,I just said it was good pizza.
Chief Trumple,It's good.
Chief Trumple,Pizza's good.
Ben Wyatt,You-- You know what I like?
Ben Wyatt,Calzones.
Chief Trumple,What the hell is wrong with this guy?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,We'll check in with you later.
Leslie Knope,Take it easy.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, will do."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,I was getting somewhere with that.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, great small talk over there."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let me handle this."
Ben Wyatt,I get a little nervous with cops.
Leslie Knope,I'm in control.
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford's in the building.
Tammy 2,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,"Same thing you're doing, celebrating Pawnee's finest."
Tom Haverford,"I believe you know my date, Tammy Swanson."
Tammy 2,"Hiya, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"Hiya, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Is seeing your ex-wife on my arm making you uncomfortable?
Tom Haverford,"Gee, I can't imagine why."
Tom Haverford,Or can I?
Tom Haverford,I like this song.
Tom Haverford,"Do you wanna dance, Tammy?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,Oh.
Tammy 2,Ah.
Leslie Knope,I know Tammy seems scary.
Leslie Knope,"But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library book peddling, sex crazed shedemon."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I think that's enough.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Tammy 2,"I was just tasting my new boyfriend, Glenn."
Tom Haverford,Tom.
Ron Swanson,"You don't know what you're mixed up in, son."
Ron Swanson,This isn't about you.
Ron Swanson,It's about me.
Tom Haverford,Typical Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford,Always thinking about yourself.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we like each other.
Tammy 2,"Yeah, maybe we do."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Let's take it easy.
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, leave him out of this."
Tammy 2,"So it's okay for you to have a girlfriend, but I'm not supposed to see anybody?"
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Ron Swanson,Just crawl back into the dank hole you came from and leave my friends alone.
Cop,"Okay, okay."
Cop,Let's settle down.
Cop,What seems to be the problem?
Cop,What seems to be the problem?
Cop,Is there a problem here?
Cop,Basically what we had here was a dispute of a domestic nature.
Cop,"White male, 40, 45."
Cop,Caucasian male.
Cop,Stocky build.
Cop,"Approximately 5'10""."
Cop,Verbal altercation transpired at approximately 8:55 P.M. with a female unsub.
Cop,Appears to be slightly intoxicated.
Cop,Claims to be an ex-spouse.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Leslie Knope,"I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake."
Tom Haverford,"Fight fire with fire, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"He dates my ex, I date his."
Leslie Knope,Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
Leslie Knope,She's moving back to Canada.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hey."
Leslie Knope,What's happening here?
Tammy 2,Ron and I are going to get a cup of coffee and talk things out.
Ron Swanson,It's time for Tammy and me to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Ron Swanson,Everything will be fine.
Chief Trumple,It's been like this for hours.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,Snap out of it!
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,Congratulate us.
Tammy 2,Ron's got one just like it on his penis.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,What the hell happened to you?
Ron Swanson,Well... Here you go.
Tammy 2,Rock and roll!
Tammy 2,"Yeah, baby!"
Ron Swanson,I got it!
Extra,You may now kiss the bride.
Ron Swanson,It's been kind of a crazy night.
Tammy 2,"Come back, come back."
Chris Traeger,"April, could you come in here a second?"
Chris Traeger,"April, way to come in."
Chris Traeger,Great initiative.
April Ludgate,You called me in.
Chris Traeger,"Listen, could you please call Ann Perkins and tell her that I will be unable to enjoy lunch with her today, as I am just swamped."
Chris Traeger,All day.
April Ludgate,Copy that.
April Ludgate,"Hi, Ann."
April Ludgate,This is April.
April Ludgate,I'm just calling to let you know that Chris can't make lunch today.
April Ludgate,I knew you wouldn't care.
April Ludgate,Goodbye.
Chief Trumple,They started having sex at the court house.
Chief Trumple,We had no choice.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, I completely understand."
Leslie Knope,"Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
Leslie Knope,And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
Chief Trumple,All right.
Chief Trumple,But keep him away from that crazy librarian.
Leslie Knope,I'll do my best.
Chief Trumple,"In fact, I don't want him within 500 feet of the library."
Leslie Knope,That's good advice for all of us.
Chief Trumple,Nothing but trouble there.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks a lot, bro."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop."
Ron Swanson,Take me back to Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"For the millionth time, no."
Ben Wyatt,"That was not the favor we needed to ask for, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"If we don't get the police for the Harvest Festival, there is no Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out later.
Ron Swanson,Can you turn the radio off?
Ron Swanson,This is our song.
Ben Wyatt,Your song is Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,You shaved off part of your mustache.
Ben Wyatt,That's lovely.
Ron Swanson,I didn't shave it off.
Ron Swanson,It rubbed off.
Ron Swanson,From friction.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron Swanson, this is an intervention."
Leslie Knope,You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the people in this room are your methadone."
Leslie Knope,And we're here to get you clean.
Jerry Gergich,Congratulations!
Jerry Gergich,"Holy matrimony, there's the man of the hour."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what is this?"
Jerry Gergich,That is the set of tumblers that I got from the registry.
Leslie Knope,This is an intervention.
Jerry Gergich,I thought you said on the phone it was a reception.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's begin."
Donna Meagle,"I would like to address the goofy Iooking, dirty kimono wearing, cornrowed clown in the room."
Donna Meagle,"If you see Ron Swanson, can you give him this message?"
Donna Meagle,You used to be a man.
Donna Meagle,You need to get your house in order.
Donna Meagle,"Look, I love you like a brother, but right now, I hate you like my actual brother, LeVondrious, who I hate."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you look great."
Tom Haverford,Your skin is glowing.
Tom Haverford,I've never seen you so happy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit down."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, I do not really understand what is going on right now."
Andy Dwyer,"But no matter what, you must keep going."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,You must stop.
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,Follow your dreams.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
April Ludgate,I work for your boyfriend.
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,"I came to see why Chris stood me up for lunch, but I think I just figured it out."
April Ludgate,Because he doesn't like you.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm pretty sure that's not it."
April Ludgate,Actually it's because I didn't call you deliberately.
April Ludgate,"Which, if you ask me, is a fireable offense."
April Ludgate,So I would tell him that.
April Ludgate,"Also, he's not into you sexually."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,Literally two of my favorite people on earth.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry that I had to cancel lunch.
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Ann Perkins,It's not a problem.
Ann Perkins,April here was very apologetic on the phone.
Ann Perkins,She also sent me flowers.
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,Nice touch.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It's Ron.
Ron Swanson,"If you're watching this, it means that once again you have danced with the devil."
Ron Swanson,"Right now, you're probably thinking, ""Tammy's changed."""
Ron Swanson,"""We'll be happy together."""
Ron Swanson,But you're only thinking that because she's a monstrous parasite who entered through your privates and lodged herself in your brain.
Ron Swanson,So you have two choices.
Ron Swanson,"One, get rid of Tammy, or two, lobotomy and castration."
Ron Swanson,Choose wisely.
Ron Swanson,You stupid.
Ron Swanson,This is a waste of time.
Ron Swanson,You people have no idea what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,That was you on the tape.
Leslie Knope,That was you talking.
Tammy 2,Ron?
Tammy 2,Ron!
Tammy 2,Ron.
Tammy 2,There you are.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"God, please."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't do that."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, it's done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy and I are in love, and we're gonna start a family together."
Ron Swanson,"In fact, she's ovulating."
Ron Swanson,"So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon."
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Ron Swanson,We're gonna spend 11 days in my cabin in the woods.
Tammy 2,We bought 10 cases of Gatorade and a 40-pound bag of peanuts for energy.
Ron Swanson,Give me it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Ann and I are headed out and I just wanted to thank you for everything today, and I will see you tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Chris."
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson has sent me over to deliver to you this document.
Chris Traeger,"""To whom it may concern, dear Chris, there is an emergency regarding the Parks Department, and April may just be the only person who can help."""
Chris Traeger,"""I can't get into details because it's superclassified."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please release April back to us permanently."""
Chris Traeger,"""God bless America."""
Chris Traeger,"""Love, Bert Macklin, FBI."""
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, bye."
Chris Traeger,"April, listen."
Chris Traeger,"If you don't want to work for me, I'm not gonna force you."
Chris Traeger,You didn't have to do this.
Andy Dwyer,She didn't do that.
Andy Dwyer,That was-- I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.
Chris Traeger,"Look, I get it."
Chris Traeger,"You're young, and trying isn't cool."
Chris Traeger,But I think you're smart.
Chris Traeger,"I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me."
April Ludgate,"Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements."
Chris Traeger,Everybody starts somewhere.
Chris Traeger,"You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people."
Chris Traeger,Think about it.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I will.
Ann Perkins,Apparently he wants April to move to Indianapolis with him.
Ann Perkins,So that's something.
Leslie Knope,I hope you're happy.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your exwife date someone you know."
Tom Haverford,Whatever happened after that is not my fault.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that."
Leslie Knope,Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, chief."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to interrupt.
Chief Trumple,"Hey, calzone boy, what's up?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, here's hoping that that nickname doesn't stick."
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Ben Wyatt,But that's not why I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope asked you for a favor the other day, but the real favor we need is much bigger."
Chief Trumple,"You mean, like calzone size?"
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,We need the Pawnee police force to volunteer as security during the upcoming Harvest Festival.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the city won't let us throw the festival unless Say no more."
Chief Trumple,Just send me a schedule of how many officers you need and when.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Just like that?
Chief Trumple,Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask why?
Chief Trumple,Because she's the kind of a person who uses favors to help other people.
Chief Trumple,"And also, my buddy Dave was the crankiest bastard in the department till he started dating Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,So she-- Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Are they still dating or--
Chief Trumple,No. Moved to San Diego a year ago.
Ben Wyatt,"Was it a serious thing, or..."
Chief Trumple,What do you care? You a pervert?
Ben Wyatt,"Nope, nope."
Ben Wyatt,I'm all good.
Ben Wyatt,Everything's fine.
Ben Wyatt,This is fine.
Tammy 2,Don't think I won't do it.
Tammy 2,I'll wear this to work.
Tammy 2,"All right, one more."
Tammy 2,"What's in here, huh? A new library card?"
Extra,Read the name.
Tammy 2,"""Tammy Swanson Swanson."""
Tammy 2,"You guys, that's amazing."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you about ready to go, my love?"
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, Ron! Stop!"
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, what the hell? Don't do it."
Tom Haverford,She doesn't love you.
Ron Swanson,You don't know what you're talking about. What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I do, okay? When I asked her to be my date, she cackled for a full minute and said, and I quote, ""Anything to make Ron miserable."""
Tom Haverford,"It's not real, man."
Tom Haverford,She's just messing with you.
Tammy 2,"He's lying, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Stay out of this, Glenn."
Tom Haverford,It's Tom! And I'm not lying.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna let you destroy Ron.
Tom Haverford,You're just gonna have to-- Ow! Ow!
Tammy 2,"He's attacking me, Ron! Kill him! Yeah! Do your worst, Glenn! You're gonna have to do better than that."
Tammy 2,"Why are you hitting yourself, Glenn? Stop hitting yourself."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, that's enough!"
Tammy 2,"What? Hey, baby."
Ron Swanson,You almost had me.
Ron Swanson,Again.
Ron Swanson,"But seeing you pick on this pathetic, defenseless little man..."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Ron Swanson,Reminded me what kind of a monster you are.
Tammy 2,You're a joke.
Tammy 2,You're not even a man anymore.
Tammy 2,"Oh, and by the way, last night, I faked four out of the seven."
Ron Swanson,So did I.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, son."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Sorry about the whole mess.
Leslie Knope,"The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief."
Ben Wyatt,I already talked to him.
Ben Wyatt,"They'll give us the hours we need, no problem."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you hungry? I haven't eaten."
Leslie Knope,"You know, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"There's a really great calzone place over in ""Idiotville."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Down on ""Terrible Idea Avenue."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,That's weird.
Ben Wyatt,"'Cause I thought it was on Beating a Dead Horse Boulevard."""
Leslie Knope,Calzones are pointless.
Leslie Knope,They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,No one likes them.
Leslie Knope,"Good day, sir."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I-- You know, I..."
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,That was funny.
Ron Swanson,High and tight.
Tom Haverford,Do you think it's gonna leave a scar?
Ron Swanson,"Tom, women like scars."
Ron Swanson,"Shows you survived an attack, and they'll assume the attack was from a man."
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ron, about everything."
Ron Swanson,To true love.
Ron Swanson,May we both find it.
Tom Haverford,I'll drink to that.
Tom Haverford,Nice glasses.
Ron Swanson,Wedding present from Jerry.
Tom Haverford,You're not gonna return them?
Ron Swanson,"Nah, too much hassle."
