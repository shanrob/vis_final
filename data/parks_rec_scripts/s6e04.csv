Character,Line
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I've gained a lot of ground in the polls."
Leslie Knope,That's good news.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I have you down only four points, but they're running a ton of new negative ads."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should fight back.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, your heart's in the right place."
Leslie Knope,Your heart and your butt.
Leslie Knope,I will not go negative.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a turd!
Extra,"Care for a ""Recall Knope"" gift bag?"
Leslie Knope,The committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.
Leslie Knope,Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
Extra,I'm Leslie Knope.
Extra,Tell your parents to recall me.
Leslie Knope,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers."
Leslie Knope,"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't."""
Donna Meagle,"Why don't you just put the ""Don't"" in front of ""Recall Knope""?"
Leslie Knope,"Yep, that's a much better idea."
April Ludgate,Can I have these question mark stickers?
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,I want to put them on stop signs.
Leslie Knope,"April, no!"
Nadia Stasky,Hi.
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I need to talk to somebody about reserving a park."
April Ludgate,"Oh, we have a new policy."
April Ludgate,Parks can only be reserved for witch covens or slip-and-slide competitions.
April Ludgate,Which one are you?
Nadia Stasky,"Uh, slip-and-slide competition."
April Ludgate,Seriously?
Nadia Stasky,No.
Nadia Stasky,Why would you even compete in something like that?
Nadia Stasky,It doesn't matter.
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I called earlier about the free vaccinations thing."
Nadia Stasky,We're hoping to set up a mobile hospital in one of your parks.
Nadia Stasky,"I'm sorry, is there something wrong with him?"
April Ludgate,"Tom, this witch wants to reserve a park for her satanic ritual."
April Ludgate,Can you help her?
Tom Haverford,Right.
Tom Haverford,Smashing.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford,I sort of run the whole department.
Tom Haverford,"Um, what was the name, then?"
Nadia Stasky,"Uh, Nadia Stasky."
Nadia Stasky,I'm from Doctors Without Borders.
Tom Haverford,Brilliant.
Tom Haverford,"The old ""D""s without ""B""s."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, we can definitely help."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Tom's your guy."
April Ludgate,He actually used to run the Parks Department in his home country of Russia.
Tom Haverford,This one is mental.
Tom Haverford,"She's joking, obviously."
Tom Haverford,How could I be from Russia?
Tom Haverford,Not with this spot-on British accent.
Tom Haverford,We can definitely get you sorted.
Tom Haverford,Right this way.
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,I am pretty sure you shouldn't have a weapon at work.
Ron Swanson,"Literally everything is a weapon, son."
Ron Swanson,"That folder, in my hands, is far deadlier than this bow in yours."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's probably true."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness."
Ben Wyatt,You mind signing it?
Ron Swanson,That's your will?
Ron Swanson,"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a complicated legal document.
Ron Swanson,It doesn't have to be.
Ron Swanson,I've had the same will since I was eight years old.
Ben Wyatt,"""Upon my death, all of my belongings shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me."""
Ben Wyatt,What are these weird symbols?
Ron Swanson,The man who kills me will know.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you should really have a will that's more than one sentence long."
Ben Wyatt,You have a wife and kids now.
Ben Wyatt,I could introduce you to our lawyer.
Ron Swanson,"The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor."
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, that document is nothing."
Ben Wyatt,It's not even notarized.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if you die and you don't have a real will, most of what you own will go to the government."
Ron Swanson,Where is this lawyer you speak of?
Leslie Knope,"I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park."
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table this bill.
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,I also submit Bill 68R.
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table.
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,You guys want to delay all my bills?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well, uh, motion to end this session early so nothing can get done."
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.
Jeremy Jamm,It's nothing personal.
Leslie Knope,It absolutely is personal.
Leslie Knope,"That is the definition of ""personal."""
Jeremy Jamm,"""The definition of personal."""
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, we have an issue."
Chris Traeger,"A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic."
Leslie Knope,It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.
Chris Traeger,"Whoever it is, it's quite serious."
Chris Traeger,Take a look at this.
Donna Meagle,"I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager."
Donna Meagle,"And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em."
Chris Traeger,"Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'."
Leslie Knope,We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,What'd it say?
Leslie Knope,"""See you tonight."""
Leslie Knope,"""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman."""
Chris Traeger,Then there's a picture of a pair of lips and then a picture of an eggplant.
Chris Traeger,"I'm both confused, and if we're being totally honest, a little aroused."
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Donna Meagle,"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse."
Leslie Knope,"What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future."
Leslie Knope,This could've really blew up in my face.
Perd Hapley,"I'm here live, at a press conference, where Councilman Jeremy Jamm will discuss a government scandal we are calling ""Twitter Watergate"" until we can find a snappier name for it."
Jeremy Jamm,Tongue baths?
Jeremy Jamm,Eggplants?
Jeremy Jamm,Firemen?
Jeremy Jamm,Those men are heroes who deserve respect!
Jeremy Jamm,9/11!
Jeremy Jamm,This is how Leslie Knope runs her Parks Department?
Jeremy Jamm,"We are going to hold hearing after hearing, until we are satisfied."
Jeremy Jamm,This will be blown way out of proportion!
Jeremy Jamm,You have my word on it!
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this is bad."
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna get fired.
Leslie Knope,"No one is getting fired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.
Leslie Knope,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Chris Traeger,Not on her watch.
Leslie Knope,He is not gonna sully your name.
Chris Traeger,No sullying allowed!
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry about it, Donna."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna nip this in the bud.
Chris Traeger,"Guard your buds, 'cause they're about to get nipped!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, why does Doctors Without Borders want to come to Pawnee?"
Nadia Stasky,Pawnee is like a petri dish of weird diseases.
Nadia Stasky,Did you know you have a higher rate of the West Nile virus than the actual Western Nile?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, West Nile, looks like Pawnee wins again."
Nadia Stasky,What else have you beaten the Western Nile in?
Tom Haverford,Cricket.
Tom Haverford,"Uh just fill out these forms, and we will be all set like two biscuits inside a tin."
April Ludgate,"So, you've gone insane."
April Ludgate,That's fun.
Tom Haverford,I just panicked.
Tom Haverford,"She's so out of my league, my brain just made me talk that way so I'd seem cooler."
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
April Ludgate,Nothing!
April Ludgate,This is amazing.
Tom Haverford,April.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"If you want to have a chance with her, obviously, you have to stop."
April Ludgate,"It's either that, or you talk like that for the rest of your life."
Tom Haverford,You think she'd marry me?
Ben Wyatt,"All right, just let me do the talking here, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant."
Ben Wyatt,We speak the same language.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there."
Ron Swanson,When will this be over?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some ""Good Will Hunting."""
Ben Wyatt,"Because he has to draw up a new will, so"
Trevor Nelson,"Yes, I understood, Mr. Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,"As I've said before, I just don't like puns."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, my accountant friends seem to enjoy 'em."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, let's begin by filling out this form, listing your assets and liabilities."
Ron Swanson,Nice try.
Ron Swanson,"I'm not telling you how much money I have, where it's hidden, or which precious metals and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of."
Trevor Nelson,"If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"Where there's a ""Will,"" there's a way."
Trevor Nelson,"I'm gonna say this one last time, Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,Check the accountant crap at the door.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, sir, I will."
Ben Wyatt,Unintentional.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, let's begin."
Jeremy Jamm,These hearings have two goals.
Jeremy Jamm,"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent."
Jeremy Jamm,"And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's actually quite simple."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again."
Jeremy Jamm,Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!
Leslie Knope,I just told you what happened.
Leslie Knope,It was an unfortunate mistake.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, sadly, due to your ""intracksidence"""
Leslie Knope,Not a word.
Jeremy Jamm,We may never find out what happened.
Jeremy Jamm,"When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, ""The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager."""
Jeremy Jamm,Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.
Jeremy Jamm,Why do you keep flip-flopping?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because I learned new information."
Leslie Knope,"When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!
Leslie Knope,It's utterly meaningless.
Jeremy Jamm,I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.
Jeremy Jamm,Perhaps he or she
Councilman Dexhart,Or them.
Councilman Dexhart,It could be a bunch of hot ladies.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need."
Tom Haverford,"What, what, what?"
Tom Haverford,There she is.
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, I didn't know what you wanted, so I got you a cappuccino, a latte, four bags of coffee beans, and a mini espresso machine."
Nadia Stasky,What happened to your accent?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,It's gone.
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,"You know, I had a cold recently."
Tom Haverford,"I think that may have affected my voice, like, in certain British ways."
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's all there is to that story, so no need for any more questions."
Nadia Stasky,You have a cold?
Nadia Stasky,Can I feel your glands?
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Nadia Stasky,"Wow, you are wearing a lot of moisturizer on your throat."
Tom Haverford,Best way to prevent crow's neck.
Nadia Stasky,Is this glitter?
Tom Haverford,"So, those are the forms."
Tom Haverford,You filled 'em out.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,April's gonna file these.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, when is the thing you're doing in the park?"
Tom Haverford,I'd love to come by and maybe help administer vaccines?
Nadia Stasky,Oh.
Nadia Stasky,"Are you a doctor, somehow?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Nadia Stasky,No followup to that?
Nadia Stasky,"Okay, great."
Nadia Stasky,"Um, well, I'm not actually gonna be attending the event, so if you could just give me the permit, so that I can go home to Indianapolis and never come back here?"
Tom Haverford,"I am in love with Nadia Whatever her last name is, and I'm gonna keep her here, using the most powerful weapon I have-- bureaucratic incompetence."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,You filled out Form 3208.
Tom Haverford,You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.
Nadia Stasky,"Oh, God."
Nadia Stasky,This is to lease a hangar at the airport.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up."
Tom Haverford,"Bureaucracy, right?"
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna do?
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,"Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?"
Tom Haverford,"I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now."
Tom Haverford,"I like to have music on while I work, you know?"
Nadia Stasky,What is this place?
Councilman Dexhart,"Ms. Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing."
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Councilman Dexhart,It's good stuff.
Councilman Dexhart,Really good stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial."
Councilman Dexhart,She was talking dirty to me.
Leslie Knope,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.
Donna Meagle,"Look, I obviously never meant to embarrass the parks department."
Donna Meagle,"My personal account is set to ""private."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, you may not know what she's writing, but we do."
Jeremy Jamm,"In a shocking twist to an already juicy story, we have obtained access to Ms. Meagle's account, via a third party."
Jeremy Jamm,Same hairdresser.
Donna Meagle,"Damn it, Typhoon!"
Donna Meagle,Why'd you do this?
Typhoon,"Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know."
Trevor Nelson,I don't even need an exact number.
Trevor Nelson,Just ballpark it.
Trevor Nelson,That's all I need to get started.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library."
Ron Swanson,"Fine, a ballpark figure."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,God.
Trevor Nelson,Holy [bleep].
Trevor Nelson,Is this a joke?
Ron Swanson,"Another word for ""jokes"" is ""lies."""
Ron Swanson,I do not lie.
Ron Swanson,"Therefore, I do not joke."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, an estate of this size means that your children would never have to work a day in their lives."
Trevor Nelson,This is going to take some time.
Trevor Nelson,"Trusts need to be drawn, tax shelters."
Ron Swanson,That's enough.
Ron Swanson,I do not need some drawn-out legal expedition to tell me what I knew when I was eight.
Ron Swanson,Here's my original will.
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever lawyer nonsense you have to to make it official, and I will sign it."
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Trevor Nelson,Wait.
Trevor Nelson,What are all these symbols?
Ron Swanson,I was right not to be threatened by you.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I would like to enter into the record a selection of Ms. Meagle's tweets."
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, can I request a brief recess?"
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let them fire you.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Beavers, if you please."
Ethel Beavers,"""Yesterday, 9:02 A.M. Annoying ass Leslie has given me another annoying ass task."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Number sign stickers, number sign bitch boss."""
Ethel Beavers,""" September 25th. Twitter poll: On a scale of 98 to 100, how annoying is Leslie Knope?"""
Ethel Beavers,"""Cuz u know it ain't less than 98."""
Ethel Beavers,"""All my number sign true blood fans know what's up."""
Jeremy Jamm,Page after page of personal attacks on Leslie Knope.
Jeremy Jamm,"Not only do you have no control over your department, you don't even have the respect of your employees."
Leslie Knope,That's what you really think of me?
Leslie Knope,You think I'm annoying?
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, sometimes you're kind of annoying."
Donna Meagle,"I mean, I thought that was your thing."
Leslie Knope,My thing?
Leslie Knope,My thing is not being annoying.
Leslie Knope,"My things are making friendship bracelets and dancing like nobody's watching, thinking up really cool nicknames for my friends."
Leslie Knope,"You of all people should know that, El Diablo!"
Donna Meagle,"Look, the only reason I'm even on Twitter is to blow off steam about work and tweet nasty stuff to dudes with washboard abs."
Donna Meagle,"You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?"
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know anymore.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having."
Chris Traeger,He is just determined.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for trying."
Leslie Knope,I have a question for you.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm annoying?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you lying?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you trying to protect my feelings?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Leslie Knope,So you do think I'm annoying.
Chris Traeger,"I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you."
Chris Traeger,"But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers."
Chris Traeger,I think a lot of things.
Chris Traeger,I like thinking.
Chris Traeger,And racquetball.
Leslie Knope,Now who's annoying?
Chris Traeger,"I spent the last hour reading some of Donna's old tweets, and it turns out there are some more things that she said about you."
Chris Traeger,"""Message to the recall haters: You can't keep Leslie Knope down."""
Chris Traeger,"""She's too real for this ish."""
Chris Traeger,"""hashtag boss bitch."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings and taking a bullet for me."""
Leslie Knope,"""hashtag sister from another mister, hashtag boss bitch."""
Chris Traeger,"It appears, whereas ""bitch boss"" is clearly an indication of her frustration, ""boss bitch"" is a term of endearment."
Chris Traeger,Isn't language fun?
Chris Traeger,It's like racquetball for your mouth!
April Ludgate,Did you change your outfit?
Tom Haverford,"I changed five times, and she hasn't noticed yet."
Tom Haverford,I can only stall for so long.
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I just finished filling this one out."
Nadia Stasky,"I didn't know what to put for ""Name of commercial airline,"" because I do not operate a commercial airline, so I just made one up."
Tom Haverford,What did you name your imaginary airline?
Nadia Stasky,"""Jet Blue Ivy."""
Nadia Stasky,I figure JayZ and Beyonce's kid will own her own airline eventually.
Tom Haverford,She's the one.
Nadia Stasky,"So, can I have my permit now?"
Nadia Stasky,Finally?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, no, there was a mistake, and we gave the park to someone else."
Nadia Stasky,What?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can drive you around and we'll pick another one?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll bring a picnic lunch.
Tom Haverford,Do you like tamales?
Nadia Stasky,You said that that park was ours.
Nadia Stasky,"You said it a long time ago, in a British accent."
Nadia Stasky,"I probably shouldn't say this, as a doctor."
Nadia Stasky,It's probably not cool.
Nadia Stasky,But I really hope you all get West Nile virus.
Nadia Stasky,"Nice meeting you, April."
Nadia Stasky,Kind of.
Nadia Stasky,You're weird too.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,We need to talk.
Ron Swanson,That has never been true.
Ben Wyatt,I think I know what's happening.
Ben Wyatt,"Thinking about how to divide up your possessions for when you die, it's tough, confronting your own mortality, and I think it's got you spinning a little bit."
Ben Wyatt,Am I right?
Ron Swanson,Wow.
Ron Swanson,I had not considered that.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, son, I am."
Ron Swanson,First joke ever.
Ron Swanson,Don't care for it.
Ron Swanson,Death does not scare me.
Ron Swanson,What I am worried about is spoiling my children.
Ron Swanson,"I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture."
Ron Swanson,"I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids."
Ben Wyatt,What matters is that you teach them the right values.
Ben Wyatt,"But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death."
Ron Swanson,I'd never lose to a boar.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?"
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry for writing those things.
Donna Meagle,Some of those things.
Leslie Knope,I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.
Donna Meagle,And I can't promise that I won't complain about it.
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,I got you an apology present.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too."
Leslie Knope,"I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually."
Donna Meagle,Let me take a picture.
Leslie Knope,Are you tweeting this?
Donna Meagle,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,"What's the hashtag gonna be? ""Boss bitch"" or ""bitch boss""?"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's ""psycho boss."""
Leslie Knope,"Eh, I don't hate that."
Ron Swanson,"Benjamin, after thinking about what you said, I've decided to leave each of my children 5% of my fortune."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, 5 whole percent."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I guess you are gonna teach them a lesson."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, that's 5%? That is a lot of money."
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, is this a joke?"
Trevor Nelson,It is not a joke.
Trevor Nelson,Not that an accountant would know the difference.
Ron Swanson,"Also, if something should happen to Diane and me, we decided that the kids should go to the most important people in our lives."
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly flattered."
Ron Swanson,Ralph Piatkowski and his wife Helen.
Ron Swanson,"He's the Maitre D' at Mulligan's Steakhouse, and he knows me better than anyone."
Ron Swanson,"However, if they are not able to do it, which seems likely, as they're in their 90s, you and Leslie are choice number two."
Ben Wyatt,I'm honored.
Jeremy Jamm,"Everyone, take your seats, so this witch hunt may proceed as scheduled."
Jeremy Jamm,"Speaking of, uh, where are the witches?"
Leslie Knope,"They're right here! Well, we're not witches."
Leslie Knope,That's sexist and offensive.
Leslie Knope,"But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points."
Jeremy Jamm,How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring?
Leslie Knope,We have had enough.
Leslie Knope,"I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me."
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Donna Meagle,"I prefer ""El Diablo."""
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, this is not over, Ms. Knope."
Typhoon,"Donna, quit punishing me! I miss you."
Donna Meagle,#NAME?
Donna Meagle,"Or should I say, ""Norman""? Uh-huh."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm just gonna man up, tell her how I feel, and hope she feels the same way about me, and that's that."
Tom Haverford,"If she doesn't, no big deal."
Tom Haverford,It's done.
Tom Haverford,I'm an adult.
Tom Haverford,Let's do it.
April Ludgate,Great.
Tom Haverford,"Nope, I can't do it."
Tom Haverford,New plan.
Tom Haverford,Tell her all the screw-ups were your fault.
Tom Haverford,"I'll tell her I had to cover for you, because you are so dumb."
Tom Haverford,Nadia! We're very sorry for everything you went through today.
Tom Haverford,I have reserved the park for your event.
Tom Haverford,"Now, April has something she'd like to admit."
April Ludgate,"Tom wants me to tell you that all the screw-ups were my fault, but really, he kept messing up so that you would stay in Pawnee as long as possible because he is super into you."
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Nadia Stasky,Several questions.
Nadia Stasky,Is any part of him British?
April Ludgate,No.
Nadia Stasky,"So, that was just weird, panicky dude behavior?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Nadia Stasky,"I'm just trying to figure out if acting that insane is, like, romantic, or totally scary."
Nadia Stasky,I'll go with romantic.
Nadia Stasky,He is kind of cute.
Nadia Stasky,What's his deal?
April Ludgate,"He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here."
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Nadia Stasky,"Well, I am going to Rwanda in, like, two weeks for my job, so, what the hell?"
April Ludgate,Cool.
Nadia Stasky,"So, you want to go out with me?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, please."
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Nadia Stasky,Bye.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you owe me, like, 1,000 favors."
April Ludgate,See ya.
