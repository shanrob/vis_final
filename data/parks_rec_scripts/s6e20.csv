Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Alcatraz."
Andy Dwyer,Can't believe Michael Bay spent a billion dollars of his own money to build that for The Rock.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you were able to recite that entire movie from memory on the plane ride.
Andy Dwyer,"You weren't trying to sleep, were you?"
Andy Dwyer,"I couldn't tell, 'cause you had that mask thing over your eyes."
Leslie Knope,This may be the craziest week of my entire life.
Leslie Knope,I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.
Leslie Knope,I am pregnant with triplets.
Leslie Knope,"I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco."
Leslie Knope,It is gonna be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,"Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, ""What happens at a national parks conference... Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday."""
Andy Dwyer,We got to find a way to break in there.
Ben Wyatt,They give tours.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly how they'll be expecting me to try to break in.
Tom Haverford,"My restaurant opens in six weeks, and I'm making sure I get every detail right."
Tom Haverford,This is the hardest I've worked on anything since... Wow.
Tom Haverford,I've never worked hard on anything.
Tom Haverford,What a cool life!
Mitch Savner,Looks like everything's on track for July.
Mitch Savner,It's just too bad we're not opening in time for this Unity concert.
Mitch Savner,The extra publicity would've given us a nice boost.
Tom Haverford,Why don't we?
Tom Haverford,We could do a soft opening tomorrow and be ready just in time for the concert crowd.
Mitch Savner,You really think you can pull that off?
Tom Haverford,"Well, nobody can predict the future except me."
Tom Haverford,"I guarantee it'll work and in six months, this place will be bigger than McDonald's."
Mitch Savner,"As always, I love your enthusiasm."
Mitch Savner,"See you tomorrow, partner."
Craig Middlebrooks,A soft opening tomorrow?
Craig Middlebrooks,"From now on, everyone call me Kristin, because I am wigging out right now!"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we're not even close to being ready."
April Ludgate,They're not even done painting that sign.
April Ludgate,"It says, ""Tom's Bi."""
April Ludgate,"Actually, no, that's good."
April Ludgate,We're ready.
Tom Haverford,Mitch is right.
Tom Haverford,The amount of buzz we get from opening next weekend is too big to pass up.
Tom Haverford,We can do it.
Tom Haverford,"""This little Italian restaurant will put McDonald's out of business"" on three."
Tom Haverford,"One, two, three."
April Ludgate,Dark Lord rise--
Tom Haverford,This little Italian restaurant will be bigger than McDonald's!
April Ludgate,In hell fire.
Leslie Knope,"""Lester Kanopf""?"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, get it together."
Lester Kanopf,That's mine.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Lester."
Grant Larson,Yours is right here.
Leslie Knope,"Grant, hi."
Grant Larson,"Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here, and since you've been ducking my calls, I just thought that I'd drop in."
Grant Larson,Care to join me for lunch?
Leslie Knope,I I wouldâ¦
Grant Larson,Liam Bonneville's gonna be there.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville-- the department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,"Well, now you've got my attention."
Leslie Knope,"Let me go grab my autograph book, and we'll head out."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with a tech company called ""Gryzzl."""
Ben Wyatt,"Now, they're giving away free wifi to a few cities across America, and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them."
Ben Wyatt,And what exactly does Gryzzl do?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, ""It's the cloud for your cloud."""
Ben Wyatt,No idea.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?"
Extra,"Uh, yeah, it's been a crazy ride."
Extra,"Our music service, Gryzzldump, launched in November, and now we have 170 million users."
Mike Bean,"Six months ago, I was working in a taco truck."
Mike Bean,Now I own one-third of the Portland trail blazers.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I think Pawnee is a great candidate for your free wireless initiative."
Ben Wyatt,We lead the country in online pizza ordering.
Ben Wyatt,"In fact, a lot of people go to the library just to order pizza online."
Mike Bean,"Right now we're kind of focused on, like, bigger cities, like Shreveport, Akron."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Obviously, we're no Akron."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're more like Dayton."
Ben Wyatt,"But with your help, we can become Toledo."
Mike Bean,"Ben, we don't like to say the word ""no""â¦"
Mike Bean,At this company.
Mike Bean,"We feel it's counterproductive to our creative mission, so, instead, let me say ""Nah, bro."""
Ben Wyatt,How is that better?
Tom Haverford,"Dwayne ""the Rock"" Swanson."
Tom Haverford,Donna told me I'd find you up here.
Tom Haverford,What's all this?
Ron Swanson,"Over the last few months, I've remodeled the entire third floor wiring, heating and cooling, restored this red pine back to its original glory."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wow."
Tom Haverford,The stripes are so wavy.
Tom Haverford,"It's really... all right, I can't keep this facade up any longer."
Tom Haverford,I need a favor.
Tom Haverford,You know those chairs you were making for my restaurant?
Tom Haverford,I need 'em now.
Ron Swanson,I was told I had until July.
Ron Swanson,My chairs take time.
Ron Swanson,"Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?"
Tom Haverford,"Please, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,I've never asked you for anything today.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,I'll get to work right away.
Tom Haverford,"Please, you're really far behind."
Grant Larson,"Hello, everybody."
Grant Larson,This is Leslie Knope.
Grant Larson,"Leslie, this is Rebecca---"
Leslie Knope,"Varuvian, yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,I know who you are.
Leslie Knope,I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.
Rebecca Varuvian,What poster?
Leslie Knope,I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.
Leslie Knope,I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.
Rebecca Varuvian,My God.
Liam Bonneville,"So you're the author of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?"
Liam Bonneville,It wasn't bad.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville read my proposal.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Rebecca Varuvian,"Liam's being withholding, as usual."
Rebecca Varuvian,That proposal was brilliantly written.
Leslie Knope,Rebecca Varuvian.
Rebecca Varuvian,Yes?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,That was the best lunch I ever had.
Leslie Knope,I have to see the photos that you took.
Grant Larson,I didn't take any photos.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Grant, come on."
Grant Larson,"Leslie, you're treating those people like they're your heroes."
Grant Larson,They could be your peers.
Grant Larson,"Look, I really hope you take the job, but we're at the end of the line here."
Grant Larson,I need a decision by tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's fair."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Grant Larson,"Hey, here's someone who may be able to convince you."
Grant Larson,"Hello, Mrs. Obama."
Michelle Obama,"Hey, Grant."
Michelle Obama,How you doing?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Grant Larson,Doing good.
Grant Larson,This is Leslie Knope.
Grant Larson,She's considering a job with us running the new Midwest Bureau in Chicago.
Michelle Obama,"Well, you know how I feel about Chicago."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!"
Michelle Obama,"That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks."
Michelle Obama,"You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year."
Michelle Obama,Are you nodding because you agree with me?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I do agree with you."
Leslie Knope,"I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever."
Leslie Knope,You and Grant work together?
Michelle Obama,"Yeah, we work together a lot."
Michelle Obama,"He's helped me integrate the ""Let's Move"" program into our national parks you know, getting kids outside, rock climbing, hiking."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"That's really, really incredible!"
Leslie Knope,Great work!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,"I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!"
Leslie Knope,My apologies!
Leslie Knope,Just-- I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,Just can I high-five you?
Michelle Obama,Yeah.
Michelle Obama,Well I hope you take the job.
Michelle Obama,Change happens one person at a time.
Michelle Obama,Good to meet you.
Grant Larson,"Again, think it over."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is a bad idea."
Andy Dwyer,Just trust me.
Andy Dwyer,You got your camera ready?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna hurt yourself.
Andy Dwyer,And here we go.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,Look at it go!
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I knew it'd go down, but not that fast!"
Andy Dwyer,Oh-ho!
Andy Dwyer,San Francisco's the best.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,I thought he was gonna be on it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Anyway I've decided.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna take the job.
Leslie Knope,"There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and I met Michelle Obama."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you lead with that?
Leslie Knope,I don't know!
Leslie Knope,Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.
Andy Dwyer,Guys!
Andy Dwyer,It's totally broken!
Tom Haverford,We have ten tables booked for the soft opening.
Tom Haverford,"It's all friends and family, so hopefully they'll go easy on us."
Tom Haverford,"How's it looking, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe speed it up a little?
Ron Swanson,This is not government work.
Ron Swanson,"As such, I treat it with care and attention."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, but also, go faster."
Tom Haverford,"I haven't had time to hire a staff yet, so, April, you'll handle service."
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?
Craig Middlebrooks,Ugh!
Craig Middlebrooks,The sawdust from Ron's chairs is everywhere!
Craig Middlebrooks,"My sinuses are on the Fritz, and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!"
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Craig, Donna's gonna be your wine taster."
Tom Haverford,You guys will work as a team.
Donna Meagle,"Fine, but if he raises his voice once, once, I'm out."
Tom Haverford,Please don't stick to that policy.
Jerry Gergich,I got the menus.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,"Larry, what the hell?"
Tom Haverford,What are these pictures?
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez, I must have given the printer the wrong flash drive."
Tom Haverford,"What is this, a rotten grapefruit?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's my dog's rectum."
Jerry Gergich,"Lord Sheldon has a growth, so we're sending pictures over to the vet."
Jerry Gergich,"But I guess this isn't good for menus, is it?"
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me."
Tom Haverford,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
Tom Haverford,I need you to take all of these dog butt pictures and burn them in the pizza oven.
Tom Haverford,"April, you list all the menu items from memory."
Tom Haverford,It'll be classier anyway.
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,What was wrong with that one?
Ron Swanson,It was too perfect.
Ron Swanson,It looked machine made.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee."
Andy Dwyer,"And then after they give us the free wifi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"I am not gonna take ""no"" for an answer."
Ben Wyatt,"If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a goingaway present free wifi for all."
Ben Wyatt,"Every time someone in Pawnee clicks through a slideshow of American music award red carpet side-boob fails, they'll say, ""Thank you, Ben Wyatt."""
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,They're playing Cones of Dunshire.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you invented that game."
Andy Dwyer,Are they playing any games I invented?
Andy Dwyer,Are they throwing dirt into a fan?
Andy Dwyer,"The key is, you have to throw the dirt into the back of the fan."
Ben Wyatt,How the hell did they-- Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,How did you guys get your hands on this game?
Extra,Someone sent it to us.
Extra,Have you played it?
Ben Wyatt,I invented Cones of Dunshire.
Extra,You're the architect.
Extra,"Yeah, right, and I'm the Alchemist of the Hinterlands."
Ben Wyatt,There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.
Ben Wyatt,The Hinterlands is a Shadow Kingdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.
Mike Bean,He's right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,Let's play.
Ben Wyatt,"If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee."
Mike Bean,Have a seat.
Mike Bean,You want to be corporal... or warrior?
Ben Wyatt,Neither.
Ben Wyatt,I'm the Maverick.
Leslie Knope,By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supersystem-- patent pending-- Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,I think it was a good presentation too.
Leslie Knope,Is that why you're laughing?
Extra,Your timeline is way off.
Extra,I was in charge of the Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.
Extra,You know when it was completed?
Extra,Last month.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How is that possible?
Extra,Merging governments requires constant hands-on management.
Extra,You're being very cavalier about the future of your town.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them."
Leslie Knope,I have a super system.
Extra,"I had a system too, but the economy went South."
Extra,My hometown hit some hard times and was converted into unincorporated territory.
Leslie Knope,You lost your cityhood?
Extra,"If you want to see this through, you need eight to ten years minimum, unless you want to run the risk of Pawnee becoming --"
Leslie Knope,Don't say it.
Extra,Unincorporated territory.
Donna Meagle,"It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, which is it fruity or earthy?"
Craig Middlebrooks,It can't be both.
Craig Middlebrooks,They're mutually exclusive!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, no!"
Donna Meagle,You do not come at me like that.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm sorry.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't know who I am anymore.
Craig Middlebrooks,A man without a palate isn't a man.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I love you, Donna."
Tom Haverford,What are you guys doing?
Tom Haverford,There's people waiting out there!
Craig Middlebrooks,"We're having a moment, you monster!"
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Stop hassling me.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you're amazing."
Tom Haverford,"You've always been like a grandpa to me, but can you please lower your standards a tiny bit so my customers have somewhere to sit?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,"I am so sorry, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't worry about it."
Tom Haverford,Restaurant superstition-- breaking a glass on the first night is good luck.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank God."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, Geez."
Ben Wyatt,"Play an action card, build a bell tower inside your citadel."
Mike Bean,My shaman casts a toyber spell on your prosperity tile.
Mike Bean,Looks like someone's out of resource gems.
Mike Bean,Uh-oh.
Mike Bean,What's so funny?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake."
Ben Wyatt,You forgot about the essence of the game.
Ben Wyatt,It's about the Cones.
Ben Wyatt,"Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer-- yes, my humble farmer-- directly into the central cone."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, man, we did it."
Andy Dwyer,This whole company is ours.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"That's mine, it's all mine."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy... for the record, I did invent this game."
Ben Wyatt,"But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee."
Mike Bean,"Yes, there is."
Mike Bean,It's the home of the architect.
Mike Bean,Let's talk.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on top of the world.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Mitch Savner,Seems like things are a little chaotic.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, everything is perfect."
Tom Haverford,This is April.
Tom Haverford,She's gonna be taking care of you tonight.
April Ludgate,"Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro."
April Ludgate,"Today we have spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, rigatoni, bucatini, lasagna."
Mitch Savner,Could you repeat that?
April Ludgate,"Spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, bucatini, lasagna."
Mitch Savner,Can I see a menu?
April Ludgate,We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.
Jerry Gergich,Great news.
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon's gonna make it.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, just have to apply a salve to his anus every hour for the rest of his life, butâ¦"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, enjoy your meal."
Mitch Savner,For crying out loud!
Tom Haverford,"No, Mitch, don't leave."
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Mitch Savner,You have no idea how to run a restaurant.
Mitch Savner,I've been in this game before and I can see the cracks starting to form.
Mitch Savner,"Sorry, kid, consider my investment terminated."
Mitch Savner,"D, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Sir, were you sitting in that chair?"
Mitch Savner,"Yes, yes I was."
Mitch Savner,Why?
Ron Swanson,No reason.
Mitch Savner,Let's go!
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's all over the Internet-- Austin, Charlotte, San Diego."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe."
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience."
Ben Wyatt,Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,What's wrong?
Leslie Knope,I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.
Leslie Knope,I have to turn down the job.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, no."
Ben Wyatt,You made up your mind yesterday.
Ben Wyatt,You-- Michelle Obama.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I've been doing this for months."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.
Leslie Knope,I'm never gonna be able to decide.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport."
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,Drive here.
Ron Swanson,So you screwed up a little.
Ron Swanson,"You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short."
Ron Swanson,That doesn't mean it's over.
Tom Haverford,My main investor pulled out.
Tom Haverford,Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.
Tom Haverford,"And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire."
Tom Haverford,So I quit.
Tom Haverford,"Just go home, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I'm not done with the chairs yet.
Ron Swanson,It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,I love quitting.
Tom Haverford,"When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home."
Tom Haverford,"That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore."
April Ludgate,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"No, my stemware!"
April Ludgate,You are not quitting.
April Ludgate,"I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday."
Tom Haverford,Why would you do this to me?
April Ludgate,You worked really hard.
April Ludgate,"You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I hate doing work, but I love being flattered, so maybe I'll give it another try."
April Ludgate,Good.
Ron Swanson,"It's a smart move, son."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood."
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Where are we going?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's right up here."
Ben Wyatt,Just trust me.
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,I'm on Endor.
Ben Wyatt,These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,That's not why we're here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a gorgeous view."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is."
Ben Wyatt,But don't look at that.
Ben Wyatt,Look at this.
Ben Wyatt,You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.
Ben Wyatt,Focus on what it actually means.
Ben Wyatt,We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.
Ben Wyatt,That's the Presidio over there.
Ben Wyatt,It's a national park.
Ben Wyatt,"So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way."
Ben Wyatt,"You take this job, places like this will be your office."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a compelling point."
Ben Wyatt,"When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it."
Ben Wyatt,"This is your chance, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"This whole region-- Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it."
Ben Wyatt,Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.
Ben Wyatt,"And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Grant."
Leslie Knope,I want the job.
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up."
Leslie Knope,It might be for the best.
Leslie Knope,"But, anyway, I love you."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is Lester Kanopf."
Leslie Knope,"No, you know who it--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Ben Wyatt,"Smoothly handled, Lester."
Leslie Knope,I panicked.
Leslie Knope,We should go.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop chop."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Tom Haverford,The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.
Tom Haverford,So what?
Tom Haverford,This is America.
Tom Haverford,"And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one afterparty to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Thomas, I have to work all day at the Unity concert."
Craig Middlebrooks,"If you're gonna pull this off, we need more people."
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I didn't want to do this, but I called in some reinforcements."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Did someone call for a party zoo?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yum, yum, yum, yum."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All right, so we got a fourway going with my ex, my brother, and this rando?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, if that's where the night is goingâ¦"
Tom Haverford,It's 9:00 in the morningâ¦
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Wha--
Tom Haverford,It's not a fourway.
Tom Haverford,And I need your help.
Tom Haverford,Take these V.I.P. invitations.
Tom Haverford,"Find all the ""A"" list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight."
Tom Haverford,I got to stop by the Parks office.
Tom Haverford,I'll meet you later.
Tom Haverford,Godspeed.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I like your energy, hombre."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I ride gokarts later?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to go horseback riding!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,"Last chance, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you are in charge."
Leslie Knope,This is your show.
Leslie Knope,Take it away.
Andy Dwyer,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions."
Andy Dwyer,Madison.
Madison,Manning that art tents.
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Donna Meagle,Scheduling and security liaison.
Andy Dwyer,Larry.
Jerry Gergich,Staying out of the way.
Andy Dwyer,And all of the rest of the volunteer work assignments are up on this board.
April Ludgate,"Your main goal today is to get 2,000 people to sign up for the Pawnee Eagleton merger preservation volunteer action squad."
April Ludgate,Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,The name is too long.
Leslie Knope,I was picturing bigger hats.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
Andy Dwyer,"Everybody, let's get to work."
Leslie Knope,Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?
Leslie Knope,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell youâ¦"
Leslie Knope,That I love and admire you.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, thank you."
April Ludgate,You say that every morning.
Leslie Knope,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,And I took the job.
Andy Dwyer,Good for you!
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,That's great!
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Knope."
Ron Swanson,The sentimental people in this office will probably miss you.
Donna Meagle,When do you leave?
Ben Wyatt,"Soon, maybe a month."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.
Tom Haverford,We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.
April Ludgate,Because you basically founded this new town.
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Knope, champion of the Pawnee Eagleton merger, ""our most faithful citizen."""
Leslie Knope,"""She never abandoned us."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Jerry Gergich,There's a quote too.
Leslie Knope,"""'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."""
Ron Swanson,I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.
Leslie Knope,"This is so touching, you guys."
Leslie Knope,I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, don't cry."
Andy Dwyer,It's not that great.
Andy Dwyer,It doesn't even look like you.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,It kind of does.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's about that time."
Andy Dwyer,Unity concert!
The Decembrists,"Hello, Pawnee."
The Decembrists,We're The Decembrists.
The Decembrists,It's great to be here in support of this event.
The Decembrists,This is truly an amazing town.
The Decembrists,"I ordered a small cheeseburger, and both the buns were pizzas."
Tom Haverford,"Joanie baby, I'm throwing a huge party tonight at Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,You gots to stop by.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You gots to stop by.
Joan Callamezzo,Will this medium drink of water be there?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The only reason I wouldn't be there is if I got pulled over... For violating my house arrest. Ahboosh!
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Judge gave me two ankle bracelets, said it was the first time he ever had to do that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh, jah boy's a question on the bar exam."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yah-hey!
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, Tom's Bistro, tonight, be there."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Don't just let me talk--
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the relocation package seems fair, but the dental plan is more than fair."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, three annual cleanings for the spouse?"
Ben Wyatt,Kaching.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, did someone say ""dental plan""?"
Jeremy Jamm,How's it going?
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman Jeremy Jamm, Jamm orthodontics."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, uh, I think we can all agree this concert blows, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"You guys really want to see a crowd, you might want to stop by my secession rally later tonight."
Jeremy Jamm,That is gonna be off the hook!
Jeremy Jamm,You ever heard of warrant?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"There's a cover band around here they call themselves ""Cherry Pie."""
Jeremy Jamm,Pretty sure we got their bass player.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Jeremy Jamm,Gonna be pretty good.
Jeremy Jamm,"Dahnahnah, rock and roll, yeah, poison"
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Jeremy Jamm,"Just general rock, man."
Jeremy Jamm,It's gonna be fun.
Jeremy Jamm,"She's my cherry pie, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Grant Larson,that guy was a councilman?
Leslie Knope,"Crazy, right?"
Grant Larson,"Okay, uh, let's talk staff."
Grant Larson,"For the first few months, you're only gonna have six staffers."
Grant Larson,Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?"
Grant Larson,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.
Grant Larson,You can hire whoever you like.
The Decembrists,"I will hang my head hang my head low, low, low"
Tom Haverford,"Ginuwine, it is an honor to be breathing the same air as you."
Tom Haverford,No joke.
Tom Haverford,But real talk we're both men about town being constantly bombarded with party invitations.
Ginuwine,Who is this guy?
Tom Haverford,"My friend who's opening a restaurant tonight, and you're going to be there, cousin, unless you want me to get onstage and talk about how we used to take baths together, how you cried whenever I took away your rubber duckies."
Ginuwine,"Damn, Donna."
Ginuwine,Why you got to bring the Quackson 5 into this?
Ginuwine,How y'all doing?
Ginuwine,"Li'l Sebastian, this one is for you, because you're my pony."
Ginuwine,I'm just a bachelor I'm looking for a partner someone who knows how to ride
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Really consider it.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?
Leslie Knope,"Hold on, come on, I'm not done."
Leslie Knope,You'd be working for the federal government.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime."
Ron Swanson,"It's very sweet, Leslie, and the national parks service is probably the only branch of government worth a damn, but Diane and I are quite happy raising our family here."
Ron Swanson,"Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a booth over there serving something called, ""fried sausage quilts,"" so I'm going to buy the booth."
Ginuwine,Just once if I had the chance
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I'm Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Imaginary friends are cool imaginary friends take the fall for you
Zoe Lewis,"Daddy, you should play music."
Diane Lewis,"Yeah, Ron."
Diane Lewis,Go on.
Diane Lewis,Get up there.
Diane Lewis,Have some fun.
Ron Swanson,I recalibrated the sights on all the rifles in the shooting gallery.
Ron Swanson,I've had enough fun for one day.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, I know that look."
Diane Lewis,Where is she?
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Ron Swanson,Hide the children.
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron's friend."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, what could possibly bring you to a children's performance-- preparing a ritual sacrifice of a newborn?"
Tammy 2,"No, just trolling for some daddy."
Tammy 2,"Oh, sorry."
Tammy 2,I pronounced that wrong.
Tammy 2,"Trolling for some dad ""D."""
Ron Swanson,"Diane, why don't you take the girls for some ice cream while I dispose of this sewer dwelling gutter witch?"
Diane Lewis,"Bye, Tammy."
Diane Lewis,Always a pleasure.
Tammy 2,"You're not fooling me, Ron."
Tammy 2,This little domestic charade of yours hasn't changed you one bit.
Tammy 2,"You're still the same old Ron Swanson, and I will defeat you."
Tammy 2,I will defeat you right into my pants.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Andy Dwyer,Everybody go crazy!
Andy Dwyer,"All right, thanks, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Remember karate on bad guys only.
Burly,"Hey, man, you were really great out there."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, burly."
Andy Dwyer,"How you doing, man?"
Burly,"Pretty good, man."
Burly,"Remember my nephew, Jack?"
Burly,He's a really big fan.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, hey, Jack."
Andy Dwyer,"Good to see you, bud."
Burly,"Hey, listen, man, I'm really sorry things ended so weird with mouse rat."
Burly,"You know, that's not really how I pictured us breaking up, you know."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I do know."
Andy Dwyer,"I always figured we'd you know, whatever break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts."
Andy Dwyer,"And then in the first game, of course, I'd break my leg."
Andy Dwyer,"Crowd starts chanting my name, and I give 'em the thumbsup."
Andy Dwyer,And then I'd go to the hospital.
Andy Dwyer,I'd get really good at chess.
Andy Dwyer,"I end up beating the computer finally, and then the band just sort of drifts apart."
Andy Dwyer,"That was how I saw it, but--"
Burly,Yeah.
Burly,Take it easy.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, see you."
April Ludgate,"Babe, that was so awesome."
April Ludgate,That was the best performance ever.
April Ludgate,One kid peed his pants because he didn't want to miss anything.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I gave a kid pee pants?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's why I do what I do."
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
Andy Dwyer,I guess I just kind of miss having people up onstage with me.
Andy Dwyer,They never tell you when you go solo that it's just gonna be you up there.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, what do you say I take you over to the ball pit, and we find your cell phone I lost?"
April Ludgate,You what?
Kay Hanley,"Just living on a Sunday morning got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and I just thought I'd think about and it might be the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky could never parallel the challenge of an acqusition in the here and now, here and now"
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, Kay Hanley!"
Leslie Knope,"I hope you like deep dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"We are not moving to Chicago for, like, a billion reasons."
Andy Dwyer,"But, babe, pizza."
April Ludgate,There's pizza in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, babe."
Andy Dwyer,You're so good at reminding me where pizza is.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, take a risk."
Leslie Knope,Live on the edge.
Leslie Knope,Life is an adventure.
Andy Dwyer,It is!
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it!
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,No.
April Ludgate,"Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here, and Chicago seems like there's a lot of stuff to do and people, but I like to do nothing with no one."
April Ludgate,"So thank you, and I love you, but, no, thank you, and I hate you."
April Ludgate,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza."
Bobby Knight Ranger,But you're motoring Yeah motoring Sister Christian.
Bobby Knight Ranger,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Bobby Knight Ranger,We have been Bobby Knight Ranger!
Andy Dwyer,Super cool to hear Sister Christian that many times in a row.
Andy Dwyer,Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.
Andy Dwyer,"This next band agreed to reunite for one night only, and it's gonna be great."
Andy Dwyer,I personally hope that they play Summer Sun.
Andy Dwyer,"We all know how it goes, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Summer sun summer sun
Scott Tanner,"Hey, Andy."
Scott Tanner,"Why don't you let us play those, bud?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, good point."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Without any further ado, land ho!"
Scott Tanner,"What up, Pawnee?"
Scott Tanner,"alone and zoned and sad no one gives a zig or zag I should have let you ride I should have let you go Thank you, Pawnee!"
April Ludgate,You miss the band?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I mean, I love that I'm Johnny Karate now, but being part of a band, that's just-- that's rock and roll, man."
Scott Tanner,"Joining us now for our finale, legendary local band, please welcome Mouse Rat!"
April Ludgate,You guys are closing this sucker down!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, how about this Unity concert, huh, Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,"I love this town so much, and I'm just so proud to live here."
Andy Dwyer,And we're gonna close tonight out with a tribute to Pawnee's greatest treasure.
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said goodbye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly bye bye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Whoo!"
All,"byebye, Li'l Sebastian you're 5,000 candles in the wind"
Andy Dwyer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Duke Silver!"
All,"byebye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion byebye, Li'l Sebastian you're 5,000 candles in the wind"
Tom Haverford,"Guys, this is the most important night of my life, which means it's the most important night of your lives too."
Craig Middlebrooks,Speak for yourself.
Craig Middlebrooks,I once got into a cab that Kyra Sedgwick was getting out of.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No way, The Closer?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oof!
Tom Haverford,It's opening night.
Tom Haverford,Let's do this!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, butt wieners!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Look who I found
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Daddy!
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Your father ruined my last business.
Tom Haverford,Why would you bring him here?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Because you told me to look for V.I.P.s, and my daddy is the V.I.-est ""P"" I know."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you, daddy."
Dr. Saperstein,"I love you too, angel."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm! Money! Money! Money! Money, please!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Craig, we're gonna drink."
Tom Haverford,"Why would you come here, Saperstein?"
Dr. Saperstein,"I came here to see your flourishing business, to see how well you're doing."
Dr. Saperstein,Wow! You're packed.
Dr. Saperstein,"Can you squeeze me in, or do I need a reservation? 'Cause there's nobody here."
Tom Haverford,Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success.
Tom Haverford,Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities.
Joan Callamezzo,Tommy!
Tom Haverford,Or maybe it will.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Joan."
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Perd."
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming by.
Tom Haverford,Can I get you a drink?
Joan Callamezzo,I'll have the Joan.
Joan Callamezzo,"It's a tumbler of gin, and it's got crushed aspirin around the rim."
Perd Hapley,And I would just like an empty glass.
Tom Haverford,"Steve, can we get these cocktails going for Joan and Perd? Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock star, thanks for coming by."
Kay Hanley,Thanks for having me.
Tom Haverford,"Come on in, guys."
Tom Haverford,"You might want to grab a seat, Dr. Saperstein."
Tom Haverford,Looks like it's getting a little crowded.
Tom Haverford,"And I said, ""you don't need a towel."""
Tom Haverford,"""You need a washcloth."""
Diane Lewis,"You know, I don't think that the girls have ever been happier or more surprised than when you got up on that stage."
Ron Swanson,"Well, having you and the kids in my life has made me a different person."
Ron Swanson,And I like it.
Ron Swanson,There's more room in my life for fun.
Barney,"Hi, Ben."
Barney,"It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to introduce yourself every time.
Barney,"I was gonna wait until your birthday to give this to you, but I'm just too excited."
Ben Wyatt,This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.
Barney,"After you gave it to us as a gift, we saw its potential, so we formed a ""C"" corp and registered it in your name."
Ben Wyatt,This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt,How can I ever repay you?
Barney,Come work for us at the accounting firm.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Barney,Oh! Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"No, sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I can't.
Barney,Wow.
Barney,Shortest one yet.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, thank you so much for organizing the mouse rat reunion."
April Ludgate,It was actually Ginuwine who arranged everything.
April Ludgate,He really cares about you.
Andy Dwyer,You're the greatest wife ever.
Andy Dwyer,I wish I could marry you all over again.
Andy Dwyer,Let's get divorced.
Andy Dwyer,"That way, we can get married again."
April Ludgate,"Yes, let's do it."
Andy Dwyer,You want to?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"We should do that, right?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
Andy Dwyer,We're getting divorced!
April Ludgate,Yes.
Tom Haverford,This is amazing.
Tom Haverford,"Practically everyone we invited came, except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus."
Tom Haverford,I was hoping tonight would be magical enough to get 'em back together.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Let it go, friend."
Craig Middlebrooks,"He's not good enough for her, and vice versa!"
Dr. Saperstein,Thomas.
Dr. Saperstein,"Yes, we don't get along, but I look at you I see driven, I see smart, and I just had the best Italian meal I've ever had in my life, and I've been to Dallas."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm in.
Tom Haverford,No way.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna let you take another one of my businesses.
Dr. Saperstein,"No, no, I'm in as a partner."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm always looking for new investments.
Dr. Saperstein,I've got an auto dealership.
Dr. Saperstein,"I've got a massage parlor, a dry-cleaning transactional holding company that is doing unbelievably well, I might add."
Dr. Saperstein,What do you say?
Tom Haverford,"You know what? I'm not really looking for investors, given the almost embarrassing level of success I've attained, but I'll consider it."
Tom Haverford,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get some pictures for my wall of fame."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley? Do you mind if I snap a you-ie? It's what I call selfies of other people."
Kay Hanley,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Can I get everyone's attention, please? Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures in support of the merger."
Ben Wyatt,"We got almost 4,000 on the first night."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody, let's keep this party going."
Tom Haverford,The next round of gnocchi is on the house.
Ron Swanson,"You look sad, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?
Leslie Knope,Everybody turned me down but Larry.
Ron Swanson,Ouch.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Well, cheer up."
Ron Swanson,"You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like."
Leslie Knope,"Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here."
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?"
Ron Swanson,"You will not, no."
Ron Swanson,"I know it's not easy to leave, but this job does seem perfect."
Ron Swanson,"Of course, I'd prefer you use your talents elsewhere."
Ron Swanson,"You know, with your courage and small frame, you'd make an excellent coal miner."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's very sweet.
Ron Swanson,It's time for you to move up in the world.
Ron Swanson,"Your ambition was bound to take you away from the town you love sooner or later, and you can't have everything you want."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can have everything I want!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,I feel like you're not listening to me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver."
Leslie Knope,When were you going to tell me about that? Unbelievable!
Leslie Knope,"I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Grant Larson,"Hi, Leslie and everyone."
Grant Larson,I'm Grant
Leslie Knope,No time for small talk.
Leslie Knope,I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago.
Leslie Knope,It's right here in Pawnee.
Grant Larson,How so?
Ben Wyatt,The financial savings here are enormous.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the cost of living is way lower here, and renting the entire third floor of this building would be way cheaper than a much smaller space in Chicago."
Tom Haverford,"Pawnee is actually closer to most of the parks in the Midwest region, and it's got Tom's Bistro an exciting new-wave Italian eatery that's equal parts Dean Martin and Bruno Mars."
Tom Haverford,But that's just what The Indianapolis Star is saying.
Tom Haverford,Let's see what everyone else has to say.
Donna Meagle,"No, no, this is not what we're doing right now."
Donna Meagle,But congrats.
April Ludgate,Leslie should stay here.
April Ludgate,"And if you don't agree with us, it's nine against one, and we can make you disappear forever."
Grant Larson,What?
April Ludgate,"I said, ""We have free wi-fi."""
Leslie Knope,"Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor."
Leslie Knope,"It's the best option, hands down."
Grant Larson,"Well, I'll run this up the flagpole."
Andy Dwyer,"Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.
Leslie Knope,I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.
Leslie Knope,But it is really how I feel today.
Leslie Knope,"I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility."
Leslie Knope,So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.
Leslie Knope,"Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them."
Leslie Knope,We are on a media lockdown.
Leslie Knope,Where is Ed with the file? Ed!
Ed,"I'm sorry, Miss Knope, I lost the file."
Ed,It's gone.
Leslie Knope,"Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry."
Jerry Gergich,"Geez! Get it together, Terry."
Leslie Knope,Clean out your desk.
Leslie Knope,You're fired.
Ed,I understand.
Ed,Thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.
Ed,"Good-bye, everyone."
Ed,It's been a great three years.
Leslie Knope,Cancel my flight to South Dakota.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it next month.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, what's our play here?"
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just go hear what they have to say.
Leslie Knope,"But honey, tonight's your big night."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is more important."
Ben Wyatt,Where are the kids?
April Ludgate,Right here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy and Aunty April, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, munchkins."
Andy Dwyer,"I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them?"
Ben Wyatt,None! Just let April do everything.
Leslie Knope,"One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Probably not.
Ben Wyatt,But that's okay.
Ben Wyatt,You ready?
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,But that's never stopped us before.
