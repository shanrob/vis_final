Jerry Gergich,They're healthy!
Ann Perkins,Holy God.
Ann Perkins,"No, they're not, they're terrible for you."
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,There's a picture of Lance Armstrong on there.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but look at the ingredients."
Ann Perkins,"""High fructose corn syrup, corn syrup."""
Leslie Knope,There's only eight grams of fat.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Per serving.
Ann Perkins,A bar is four servings.
Leslie Knope,"Well, people seem to enjoy them."
Leslie Knope,Look how happy everybody is.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a sugar rush."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That makes sense.
Ann Perkins,"They're gonna crash soon, and it's not gonna be pretty."

Leslie Knope,We might find something interesting.
Leslie Knope,"Here, just let me stick them under my shirt."
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,Just walk out.
Ann Perkins,They have sensors!
Ann Perkins,Just check them out.
Ann Perkins,It's free.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Marci."
Marci,Leslie.
Marci,Are they finally teaching you Parks people how to read?
Marci,"Oh, I guess not."
Marci,It's a movie.
Leslie Knope,You're pretty cocky for someone whose job is obsolete because of the Internet.
Marci,Let's see.
Marci,Hmm.
Marci,You seem to have a 40 dollars late fee on a book called Mysteries of the Female Orgasm.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Marci,"Yeah, you do."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, grab the movie!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go, go!"
Leslie Knope,Punkass book jockeys!
Paul,"So, you guys all good with the Sweetums concession stand deal?"
Paul,I can go ahead and sign off on it?
Ron Swanson,You betcha.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are worried that the energy bars that they're gonna sell are grossly unhealthy and they're misleading people about what's actually in them.
Ron Swanson,"No, we're not worried about that."
Ron Swanson,We're fine and we sign off.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can I have a sidebar with Ron?"
Paul,I guess.
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I did some research, and NutriYums are terrible for you."
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,We're doing it.
Leslie Knope,That's a-- We're in a sidebar.
Leslie Knope,Do you not care about your city's health?
Ron Swanson,I care about the people's right to consume whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can you and I have a sidebar?"
Paul,No.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think maybe we should hold a public forum.
Leslie Knope,That way we won't be liable.
Ron Swanson,There's no point.
Ron Swanson,It's a home run for the city.
Paul,"No, I think she's right."
Paul,"It's a good ""cover our ass"" move."
Paul,Let's do it.
Ron Swanson,Paul!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, why must you stick your nose into everyone else's business?"
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Paul."
Leslie Knope,Ron's upset because I didn't let him drive last night.
Ron Swanson,Stop sidebarring.
Leslie Knope,Somebody's grouchy.
Mark Brendanawicz,You said it was just odds and ends.
Tom Haverford,"It is, yeah."
Tom Haverford,And some furniture.
Tom Haverford,And the plasma TV.
Mark Brendanawicz,You haven't even folded up the boxes yet.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Deep Blue Sea."
Andy Dwyer,Greatest movie ever made.
Tom Haverford,"That's the Canadian version, and there's a bonus audio track where LL Cool J raps all his dialog."

Andy Dwyer,We're watching this right now.
April Ludgate,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Pop it in!
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,We should really pack this room up and get moving.
Tom Haverford,"So, this is a really big room I need packed up, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz,This is your bedroom?
Tom Haverford,"No, it's a spare room I converted into a walk-in closet/ home fitness center."
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,I strapped an MP3 player to one of those floor cleaning robots.
Tom Haverford,"I call him ""DJ Roomba."""
Tom Haverford,Little guy cruises around and plays music.
Tom Haverford,"What's hot, DJ Roomba?"
Tom Haverford,"DJ Roomba, tearing it up!"
Andy Dwyer,He likes me.
Tom Haverford,"Let's dance for a little while, Mark."
Ann Perkins,What NutriYums energy bars are just absolutely loaded with high fructose corn syrup and fatty oils.
Ann Perkins,"And any way you slice it, they're just extremely unhealthy for you."
Ron Swanson,Leslie needs to butt out.
Ron Swanson,"The whole point of this country is, if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can."
Ron Swanson,You are free to do so.
Ron Swanson,"To me, that's beautiful."
Ann Perkins,Any questions?
Extra,"If sugar is so bad, how come Jesus made it taste so good?"
Ann Perkins,Yes?
Gretel,But isn't all food bad for you?
Gretel,I've been eating lasagna and muffins every day of my life for 40 years and I feel terrible.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Chance Frenlm,What's so bad about corn syrup?
Chance Frenlm,It's natural.
Chance Frenlm,Corn's a fruit.
Chance Frenlm,Syrup comes from a bush.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Extra,How do we know you're really a nurse?
Ann Perkins,"I am, I promise."
Ann Perkins,I work at Saint Joe's.
Extra,"Well, the point is, my friend thinks you're cute."
Extra,Give me your number so he can have it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen."
Extra,Can I have your e mail address?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Extra,I just got on AOL.
Ann Perkins,No!
Chance Frenlm,I think we ought to throw those bars out and eat ham and mayonnaise sandwiches.
Ann Perkins,That's not a good idea.
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,That's not-- No.
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no."
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you do this every week.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually encouraged.
Leslie Knope,The questions were more relevant than usual.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I need to order the brown Timberlands in a size eight, narrow."
Tom Haverford,How much is the next day shipping?
Tom Haverford,"And, what's two day shipping?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order for one pad thai, chicken, and no scallions on it, please."
Tom Haverford,"Just for one person, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Just one.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I saw Mark carrying, like, three boxes."
Tom Haverford,That dude is strong.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,I'll carry five boxes!

Donna Meagle,That's it.
Donna Meagle,My baby has a delicate suspension.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you kidding me?
Donna Meagle,"No, I'm not."
Donna Meagle,Move.
Tom Haverford,"Put it in your truck, Brendanawicz."

Nick Newport Jr.,Yet.
Commercial,NutriYums.
Commercial,Where nutritious meets tasty.
Commercial,By Sweetums.
Randall,I guess that about says it all.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't, actually."
Leslie Knope,"I think we should watch another video right now, one that your company made 30 years ago."
Nick Newport,"I'm Nick Newport, president of Sweetums, giving you a look inside our corn syrup factory."
Nick Newport,"This is all new, high fructose corn syrup, a miracle product that's sweeter than sugar, but cheaper to produce!"
Nick Newport,"Cheap, delicious, sugary corn is currently being used by farms to fatten up their cows and pigs."
Nick Newport,Look how fat those cows are!
Nick Newport,"Fat, happy and docile, the way we like them."
Leslie Knope,"So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?"
Randall,"Corn syrup is natural, and it's fine in moderation."
Randall,But don't take my word for it.
Randall,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nick Newport, Jr.!"
Nick Newport Jr.,All right!
Nick Newport Jr.,What's going on?
Nick Newport Jr.,Yeah!
Nick Newport Jr.,How you doing?
Nick Newport Jr.,Yeah!

Andy Dwyer,Don't get my shoes.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, guys?"
Andy Dwyer,"You come to help Tom move, too?"
Andy Dwyer,Too late!
Andy Dwyer,We already almost got all of it.
Derek,"No, we just thought it'd be funny to see April doing physical labor."
Andy Dwyer,It's been an awesome moving day.
Andy Dwyer,I got the little robot to play Dave Matthews.
Andy Dwyer,Little baby!
Ben,What's he talking about?
April Ludgate,DJ Roomba.
Ben,What?
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Back to the grindstone.
Andy Dwyer,"Awesome seeing you, dudes."
Ben,See you.
Derek,"Later, bro."
Derek,Hi.
April Ludgate,Hi.
Wendy,"God, this is so weird."
Wendy,"It's, like, end of an era, huh? It's kind of sad."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, we'll still be friends."
Wendy,Yeah.
Wendy,"Well, hey, you guys must be starving."
Wendy,You want me to order you pizza or something?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, that'd be great, yeah."
Wendy,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you get some Canadian bacon on it, since you're from Canada."
Wendy,Mmm-hmm.
Tom Haverford,"And sausage, 'cause I am brown and spicy."
Wendy,"Okay, all right."
Wendy,"Well, I will see you around, I guess."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Wendy,Right?
Tom Haverford,I'm around.
Wendy,I'll see you around.
Tom Haverford,Bye.
Wendy,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, Jr., thank you so much for coming."
Leslie Knope,"But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies? Right, everybody?"
Extra,Is Shoelace here? Where's Shoelace?
Nick Newport Jr.,Shoelace couldn't make it.
All,Aw!
Nick Newport Jr.,But I do agree with this nice lady.
Nick Newport Jr.,That's why I say we should let the people be the judge.
Nick Newport Jr.,Denver?
Denver,Everybody! Check under your seats!
Extra,"Look, look! I got chocolate!"
Leslie Knope,"Denver, you little son of a bitch."
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,There's no pizza left?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Jer."
Tom Haverford,Too slow.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you want my crusts? Here, take this."
Jerry Gergich,Nobody even told me the pizza was here.
Tom Haverford,Jerry! You stepped on DJ Roomba!
Jerry Gergich,That was an accident.
Tom Haverford,You killed him! I built him myself.
Tom Haverford,He was like a son to me.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Time to vote.
Ron Swanson,"All those who would like the bloated corpse of the government to keep running the snack bars at taxpayer expense, raise your hands."
Leslie Knope,That seems like an unfair phrasing.
Leslie Knope,"And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, everybody."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe this.
Leslie Knope,You know what? We did our job.
Leslie Knope,We informed the public.
Leslie Knope,That's all we can do.
Landlord,"I'm sorry, man."
Landlord,There's nothing we can do.
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?
Landlord,"Look, we'll get it fixed and I'll see you Monday."
Tom Haverford,I just got off the phone with my new landlord.
Tom Haverford,"Apparently, there's been some sort of gas leak and I can't move into my place until Monday now."
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you telling us we have to unload this and move it back in the house?
Tom Haverford,"No, I can't put it there."
Tom Haverford,I promised Wendy I'd be out of here tonight.
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"Everybody go home, pack away my stuff in your own houses."
Tom Haverford,"Then on Monday, pack it back up, meet me at my new place, unload it there."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you, Tom."
Donna Meagle,Bye.
Jerry Gergich,Later.
Derek,"Hey, bro, wanna go get our grub on?"
Ben,"Totes, bro."
Ben,Wings and brews!
April Ludgate,Why are you guys talking like that?
Derek,"Just chillaxin' like your new bro, Andy."
Ben,Yeah.
Ben,"Wanna play some Hacky Sack later, maybe listen to Blues Traveler?"
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I'm leaving.
Derek,We're just kidding.
Derek,Let's go to dinner.
April Ludgate,I'm not hungry.
April Ludgate,And you guys aren't being funny.
Derek,Why are you being weird? We make fun of people like that.
Derek,That's what we do.
April Ludgate,"You know, for a gay couple, you guys are being really gay."
Nick Newport Jr.,"I said, ""Of course I remember you. You're Chastity, right?"""
Ron Swanson,"Leslie! Even though I didn't invite you, you came here anyway."
Ron Swanson,"I respect that, because you made a choice as a free American."
Ann Perkins,What are you eating?
Ron Swanson,"I call this ""turf and turf."""
Ron Swanson,It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse.
Ron Swanson,"Also, whiskey and a cigar."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.
Waiter,"No cigars inside, sir."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I will smoke the entire thing outside.
Ron Swanson,"Even though it is bad for me, I am going to do it."
Ann Perkins,Why is he being such an ass?
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Ron Swanson,"It's freezing outside, so I will not be smoking this cigar."
Ron Swanson,"But rest assured, I could if I wanted to, because this--"
Leslie Knope,"This is America, right? Is it?"
Leslie Knope,"May I speak with you, please? Look, I don't know if you're being a jerk on purpose just to prove you have the right to be a jerk, but either way, you're being a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,Take the booze chart.
Ron Swanson,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay? I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope,"By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while."
Leslie Knope,"The first line, by the way? ""O Captain! My Captain! Ron Swanson, a swan song."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and it gets better from there."
Andy Dwyer,April! April! You wanna watch me rollerblade in the parking lot after work? I'm pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I used to be really good.
Andy Dwyer,"That was, like, 70 pounds ago."
April Ludgate,I can't.
April Ludgate,I'm kind of busy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's lame."
Andy Dwyer,Tomorrow?
April Ludgate,Maybe.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,Just kidding! I don't fall!
Ron Swanson,What are you eating?
Leslie Knope,I didn't have time to have breakfast.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna toss these in the dumpster outside.
Ron Swanson,And I don't wanna see you digging around in there later.
Ron Swanson,I am sorry.
Ron Swanson,I have been a horse's ass.
Ron Swanson,And that is the end of what I have to say.
Leslie Knope,Apology accepted.
Leslie Knope,Put a coat on.
Leslie Knope,It's freezing outside.
Tom Haverford,Jerry! Jerry! This is the ghost of DJ Roomba.
Tom Haverford,"Why did you kill me? I'm gonna haunt you, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna follow you and play the Black Eyed Peas on a non-stop loop!
