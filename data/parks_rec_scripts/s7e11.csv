Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Listen.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie's gonna walk in and say something that sounds very boring, but is actually a really big deal."
Ben Wyatt,"So when I give the signal, just, everybody, cheer like crazy."
Ben Wyatt,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone just officially enrolled in the Senior Executive Service Development Candidate Program at the Department of the Interior."
Andy Dwyer,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"So, my promotion is official."
Leslie Knope,We need to find a place in D.C.
Leslie Knope,Because we're gonna be splitting our time.
Donna Meagle,I guess now is as good a time as any to make my announcement.
Donna Meagle,Joe and I just closed on a house in Seattle.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, actually, I have an announcement, too."
Jerry Gergich,"After all these years in government, I have decided to finally retire."
April Ludgate,"This is about people who are moving, Garry."
April Ludgate,Not everything is about you.
Jerry Gergich,Good point.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's scattering.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look at it this way."
Leslie Knope,"Bad news comes in threes, right?"
Leslie Knope,"We're leaving, April and Andy are leaving, Donna's leaving."
Leslie Knope,That's three!
Jerry Gergich,"Also, I'm retiring."
Leslie Knope,"That's three, Garry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're probably due for some good news."
Perd Hapley,Good evening.
Perd Hapley,I come to you tonight with some good news.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Perd Hapley,Is not a sentence I will be saying to you right now.
Perd Hapley,"Because, beloved Pawnee Mayor Walter Gunderson has died."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you jinxed us, Garry."
Leslie Knope,Thanks a lot.
Ben Wyatt,Walter Gunderson served Pawnee for 39 years.
Ben Wyatt,"And as per his final wish, his body will lie in state, in the city council chambers for a day."
Ben Wyatt,Which is just a real cool thing for a public space.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, he sent us a brief video message to be played for this event."
Walter Gunderson,"Hello, Pawnee."
Walter Gunderson,My time in office has come to an end.
Walter Gunderson,A lot has been done.
Walter Gunderson,But I wasn't really doing very much.
Walter Gunderson,I wasn't paying attention most of the time.
Walter Gunderson,"Fortunately, the citizens of Pawnee didn't pay attention either."
Walter Gunderson,"So, uh, if there's credit to take, I will humbly take it."
Walter Gunderson,"And if there is blame, it's your fault."
Walter Gunderson,Thank you.
Walter Gunderson,And goodbye forever.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that was really something."
Leslie Knope,"People are dying, moving, retiring."
Leslie Knope,"Too many endings, not enough beginnings."
Leslie Knope,We need something to begin.
Leslie Knope,And I have just the thing.
Leslie Knope,An underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,But someone here will.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,Will you help me out with something?
April Ludgate,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, as city manager, I'm in charge of appointing an interim mayor until the special election."
April Ludgate,"So, why don't you just appoint yourself?"
April Ludgate,You're basically running the town anyway.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was a mayor once before."
Ben Wyatt,We all remember how that went.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah, you completely disgraced yourself and destroyed an entire town."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I said we all remember."
Ben Wyatt,Now will you help me find someone?
Ben Wyatt,It can be anyone over the age of 30 who's a good symbolic face for the town.
April Ludgate,"Fine, whatever, I'll help you."
April Ludgate,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I told Garry he could help too.
April Ludgate,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, notarizing a new mayor, that is-- Well, it's like the ultimate notary adventure."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it's big."
Tom Haverford,LesLegally Blonde.
Tom Haverford,Got you a little gift in New York.
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,What did you get me?
Leslie Knope,Oohlala.
Leslie Knope,Men's Ferragamo loafers.
Leslie Knope,What am I supposed to do with these?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you're right, I should probably keep 'em."
Tom Haverford,"They're a size six and a half, too small for you anyway."
Leslie Knope,How was your trip?
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,Lot of great meetings.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy and I had the best time."
Tom Haverford,"It's for real, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,We even went to a jewelry store and looked at rings.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Shia LaBeouf is one hell of a jewelry designer, by the way."
Tom Haverford,The man's really found his calling.
Leslie Knope,This is perfect.
Leslie Knope,"What with everything ending, you guys are the happy beginning that we all need."
Leslie Knope,You should propose to her.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,What better place to ask a woman to marry you than an old man's public memorial?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm probably gonna wait.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy's not in town."
Tom Haverford,She's in Philadelphia visiting friends.
Tom Haverford,She gets back tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?"
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna find April.
Tom Haverford,I got her a really nice Burberry necktie.
Andy Dwyer,Gunderson was mayor my entire life.
Andy Dwyer,It really makes you consider the postulence of time.
Donna Meagle,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"Death is natural, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger."
Donna Meagle,Speak for yourself.
Donna Meagle,"Before I die, I'm freezing my head like Ted Williams."
Donna Meagle,"Wait a thousand years, thaw it out, slap it on a robot, Keep on ballin'."
Carl,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Carl.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, Andy, this is Carl."
Ron Swanson,He owns the deli right next to my barber Salvatore's shop.
Carl,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
Carl,First Salvatore and now Mayor Gunderson.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Ron Swanson,Explain yourself.
Carl,"Oh, Ron, you didn't hear?"
Carl,Salvatore passed away yesterday.
Ron Swanson,No.
Donna Meagle,Geez.
Ron Swanson,"No, it can't be."
Andy Dwyer,"Was he killed by a younger, stronger barber?"
Ben Wyatt,"And now, here to say a few words is Mayor Gunderson's longtime friend and coworker, Ethel Beavers."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so sad.
Leslie Knope,They worked together for a long time.
Ethel Beavers,I'll be brief.
Ethel Beavers,Walter Gunderson and his wife had an open marriage.
Ethel Beavers,It kept him happy.
Ethel Beavers,It kept his wife happy.
Ethel Beavers,"Hi, Evelyn."
Ethel Beavers,And it definitely kept me happy.
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Ethel Beavers,"Because for 46 wonderful years, he spent night after night exploring every nook and cranny of my body."
Ethel Beavers,"Grow up, you prudes."
Ethel Beavers,We're all adults.
Ethel Beavers,My only regret is that I never told him how I really felt.
Ethel Beavers,"So, I'll say it now."
Ethel Beavers,"I loved that man, and not just because he was a dynamite lay."
Ethel Beavers,"Good night, you animal."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Listen to Ethel.
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's too gross."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Listen to her message.
Leslie Knope,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!"
Leslie Knope,"46 years later, they're gone."
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,"We know we want to be together forever, so why wait?"
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,And I will help you with the proposal.
Leslie Knope,What do you wanna do?
Tom Haverford,"Off the top of my head, I guess, my ideal proposal might be a multiplatform media experience."
Tom Haverford,"An action movie, with explosive graphics, fast cars and a hero with one mission, to propose to his lady."
Tom Haverford,A hero named Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,Tom Haverford
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?"", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store."
Tom Haverford,Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Ian,"Oh, no."
Ian,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, lan."
Leslie Knope,"I need a gigantic banner that says ""Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"" and I need it by tomorrow."
Ian,No way.
Ian,Impossible.
Leslie Knope,"Over the past 15 years, I have spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars at your banner store."
Leslie Knope,I have ordered banners for every personal and professional event that I've ever organized.
Leslie Knope,"My credit card company called me about it, not to question the charges, but to sincerely ask me if I was mentally stable."
Tom Haverford,"See that Rolex Submariner on your wrist, bro."
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause of Leslie.
Tom Haverford,You'll have the banner done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Bobby."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
Bobby Newport,Good to see you guys.
Bobby Newport,It's been a while.
Bobby Newport,How's Leslie?
Bobby Newport,"Is she still, um Uh Oh."
Bobby Newport,"What was that thing we ran for, again?"
Ben Wyatt,City Councilor.
Bobby Newport,"Well, all right."
Bobby Newport,If you say so.
Bobby Newport,"I tell ya, it's so hard to remember boring stuff like that."
Ben Wyatt,"Choosing to ignore what you just said, we need an interim mayor, just for two months."
Ben Wyatt,"And given your family name and how well liked you are, I thought you might be interested."
Bobby Newport,"What, mayor?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Bobby Newport,"Man, that would be fun."
Bobby Newport,"God, I don't think I can do it, though."
Bobby Newport,"Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready to go on a big trip."
Bobby Newport,To space.
Bobby Newport,"That'll be really fun, too."
Bobby Newport,"Everything in life is always just so fun, right?"
Jerry Gergich,It really is.
Bobby Newport,"See, this guy knows what's what."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, uh What's that?"
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Ben, have you ever been to space?"
Bobby Newport,You should check it out.
Bobby Newport,Seriously.
Bobby Newport,I'm sure the Russian guys who built the rocket would be cool with it.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Bobby Newport,Just one thing.
Bobby Newport,"Do you have 600,000 dollars?"
Bobby Newport,That's what they need for the deposit.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, no."
April Ludgate,I've already been to space.
April Ludgate,I was the second person to walk on the moon.
April Ludgate,"Buzz Aldrin, nice to meet you."
Bobby Newport,Nice try.
Bobby Newport,That's the guy from Toy Story.
Donna Meagle,"We're so sorry, Ron."
Donna Meagle,You guys were close?
Ron Swanson,I've seen Salvatore the first Tuesday of the month for the past four decades.
Ron Swanson,Same exact thing every time.
Ron Swanson,I paid him $8.
Ron Swanson,"I sat in the same chair, Salvatore put the same cape over me."
Ron Swanson,And then he'd always ask me about the same thing.
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,It was perfect.
Ron Swanson,I can't delay this forever.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Ron Swanson,"The three most important people in a man's life are his barber, his butcher and his lover."
Ron Swanson,I have lost one of those.
Ron Swanson,"Here's a tenner, Sal."
Ron Swanson,"As you know I don't believe in tipping, so I will collect my change from your wife."
Ron Swanson,I had an appointment with Salvatore scheduled for Tuesday.
Ron Swanson,Look how raggedy my hair is.
Ron Swanson,"What am I supposed to be, some kind of rock star?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, there's your mark, you'll enter from the front."
Leslie Knope,"Ted, are we rolling?"
Theodore,I think so.
Theodore,I don't really know.
Theodore,Just please be careful with my store?
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Quiet on the set!
Leslie Knope,Action.
Leslie Knope,"'Allo, would you like to see some rings, Agent Haverford?"
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing an accent?
Leslie Knope,I came up with a backstory for my character.
Leslie Knope,"She's married to a French billionaire, and she has a twin sister, identical, and they keep--"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you have one line."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I committed to the role!"
Leslie Knope,'Allo.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see some gorgeous jewelry?
Leslie Knope,We have the most rare diamonds in the world.
Tom Haverford,I'll take that one.
Tom Haverford,The most expensive one.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Not so fast, Haverfraud."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Zut alors!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Get him, boys."
Leslie Knope,Freeze.
Leslie Knope,Stunt double.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Action!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Go, my puppets."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Go, my puppets!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Fight.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Fight, my puppets!"
Leslie Knope,Rack focus.
Leslie Knope,Pan left.
Theodore,I don't know what any of that means.
Leslie Knope,Just get the right Go under the--
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My puppets!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, that's it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, you want the big dog?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that what you want?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want the big dog?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ahhh!
Tom Haverford,"Lucy, your mission, should you choose to accept it is, to marry me."
Leslie Knope,And cut.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that was amazing!"
Theodore,"No, it wasn't."
Theodore,You just destroyed my case.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"It's the movie business, Ted."
Leslie Knope,You knew the risks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody in the van."
Leslie Knope,We're headed to the next location.
April Ludgate,You should totally do it.
April Ludgate,You'd be an amazing mayor.
April Ludgate,"Actually, you should be President."
April Ludgate,Of the universe.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,"You know, I really would make an incredible mayor."
Joan Callamezzo,"But sadly, I cannot."
Joan Callamezzo,Because I'm only 27 years old.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"So, you were born in the 1990s?"
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh!
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Dr. Saperstein,"What a lovely offer, but I think not."
Dr. Saperstein,"You know, I've got my hands full with my practice, my other businesses, my two terrible children."
Dr. Saperstein,I don't think I have time to be mayor.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hold up.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I will do John Mayer, again."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Daddy, someone set a fire in your car because you took too long and I got bored."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, there's no money."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"My bad, no problem."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,That's fine.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Um, I'll just destroy this office."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please."
Dr. Saperstein,Ben.
Dr. Saperstein,Give her some money.
Dr. Saperstein,It's easier.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to say, The Douche, I'm skeptical that your interest is sincere."
The Douche,I can understand that.
The Douche,A morning shockjock DJ the Mayor?
The Douche,But keep an open mind.
The Douche,I went to Northwestern.
The Douche,"I've worked on two political campaigns, and I spend all of my time communicating with the public."
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good point.
The Douche,I could do some great things for this city.
The Douche,And some gross things with those juicy City Hall interns.
The Douche,Ga-ga-goink!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Well.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
The Douche,"All right, ""B""."
The Douche,Let me know.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
April Ludgate,"Well, I think we have our answer."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on."
Ben Wyatt,Think.
Ben Wyatt,There's got to be someone.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Ben.
April Ludgate,"You know that I despise you, and that I want you and all people on Earth to be miserable."
April Ludgate,Right?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
April Ludgate,You should be mayor.
April Ludgate,You're the best person for the job and you deserve it.
April Ludgate,"Plus, this would erase Ice Town."
April Ludgate,It's been torturing you since you were 18 years old.
April Ludgate,"And if you became Mayor of Pawnee, you could put it behind you, once and for all."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,Being nice made me feel terrible.
The Douche,My oral office.
Ben Wyatt,What?
The Douche,I'm gonna turn the mayoral office into my oral office.
The Douche,Boom!
The Douche,"Thought of it a second ago, had to pop back in."
Ben Wyatt,"""Had to""?"
The Douche,Had to.
Donna Meagle,"Buck up, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"It's like you said, death is natural."
Donna Meagle,"And Sal lived a good, long life."
Ron Swanson,"But so much is changing, and I've never been a fan of change."
Ron Swanson,Salvatore was a constant in my life.
Ron Dunn,"In my experience, the only ""constant"" is change."
Ron Swanson,Oh [bleep].
Ron Dunn,"Nice to see you, Ron."
Ron Dunn,I couldn't help but overhear.
Ron Dunn,I sure am sorry about your loss.
Ron Dunn,"Every time we lose a compadre, our collective lantern gets a little bit dimmer."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you look awful familiar."
Andy Dwyer,Have we met before?
Ron Dunn,I'm sure our souls have collided in one lifetime or another.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,Are you in my Frisbee golf league?
Ron Dunn,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Dunn,I play for the Super Spinners.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the Frisbee Champs.
Ron Dunn,"Ah, cool."
Andy Dwyer,I named us.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, stop speaking to this man."
Ron Swanson,He is the worst human being on Earth.
Ron Dunn,"Oh, come on."
Ron Dunn,Death makes brothers of us all.
Ron Dunn,"I've always found that when my soul aches with loss, it's best to turn to Eastern wisdom."
Ron Swanson,This is from the Isle of Islay in Scotland.
Ron Swanson,This is as eastern as my wisdom gets.
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, this handsome spiritual cowboy may actually be right about turning to the east."
Donna Meagle,I have an idea.
Donna Meagle,Trust me?
Andy Dwyer,Who cuts your hair?
Ron Dunn,Nobody.
Ron Dunn,"Whenever my hair feels it has completed its journey, it simply sheds itself off."
Ron Swanson,I hate you so much.
Ron Dunn,"And I love you, my brother."
Tom Haverford,I'm really glad you were here to help me with all this today.
Tom Haverford,"You've always been there for me, and I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're pretty cool."
Leslie Knope,I'm cool?
Leslie Knope,I'm cool.
Leslie Knope,I'm a cool dudette.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's pizza time.
Tom Haverford,And you've lost it.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, there's Lucy."
Lucy,"Hey, babe."
Tom Haverford,We're calling this off.
Tom Haverford,It's all wrong.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Is it because I said, ""It's pizza time""?"
Tom Haverford,"No, but that definitely didn't help."
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Tom Haverford,"Grab Jean-Ralphio, and get these three things."
Tom Haverford,And meet me at the Snakehole Lounge in 30 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"I have no idea what's happening, and I'm very scared that everything is falling apart."
Leslie Knope,But you seem like James Bond right now.
Tom Haverford,Go!
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy ""T"", we got you everything you asked for."
Tom Haverford,I didn't ask for flavored condoms.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, no, no, that's just me looking out for you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"See, girls get mad horny when you propose."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's why I do it all the time.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what are we doing?"
Leslie Knope,There are hundreds of people waiting for us.
Tom Haverford,"No time to explain, Les, but don't worry, I have a plan."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I will leave.
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Tom Haverford,You wanna stay and hide and watch the proposal?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I already picked a place."
Leslie Knope,Don't follow me!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,But I'm gonna.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm about to be the mayor.
Jerry Gergich,I can't believe I'm about to notarize it.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"So, look, just sign right there and then we can let the notary fireworks begin!"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,I don't wanna do this.
April Ludgate,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"I spent so long trying to forget about Ice Town, but it's part of my life."
Ben Wyatt,It set me on this path.
Ben Wyatt,"It led me to Pawnee, to my job, to Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Who knows where I'd be without it.
Ben Wyatt,I like that Ice Town happened.
Ben Wyatt,And I don't wanna erase it.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening to anything you just said, but who is gonna be the mayor for the next two months then?"
Ben Wyatt,Garry Gergich.
Ben Wyatt,"How would you like to be the next mayor of Pawnee, Indiana?"
April Ludgate,No!
Lucy,What is all this?
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole Lounge is where we first met.
Tom Haverford,"On our first date, I gave you a single daisy, like this."
Tom Haverford,And after that we ate late night pancakes at J.J's.
Tom Haverford,"And while we were there, I pulled out a deck of cards, and I tried to show you a magic trick I learned on a David Blaine special."
Tom Haverford,"Unsurprisingly, I failed, and you made fun of me, ruthlessly."
Tom Haverford,"I haven't done this trick in a while, but I think I'm ready to try it again."
Tom Haverford,Pick a card.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no."
Tom Haverford,Go a little bit over to the left.
Tom Haverford,There you go.
Lucy,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Really?
Lucy,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That was so sweet.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It really was.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"So, what's your story again? I mean, how married are you? Are you down to clown? You in that rude mood?"
Leslie Knope,Why are you like this?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Pills, baby!"
Typhoon,"Donna, this is crazy."
Typhoon,Typhoon is an artist and the human head is--
Donna Meagle,Is his canvas.
Donna Meagle,Just listen.
Donna Meagle,"You're gonna cut the man's hair, you're gonna charge him $8."
Donna Meagle,It will take you four minutes.
Donna Meagle,So just shut up and make the man look like this.
Typhoon,Fine.
Typhoon,Ugh.
Ron Swanson,"So, Typhoon, what do you like to do for fun?"
Typhoon,"I'm writing an electronic opera about Brittany Murphy, and I do the chandelier design for my friend's drag puppet show."
Ron Swanson,No further questions.
Typhoon,All I really want to do is dance.
Typhoon,"Except lately, all the good warehouse raves are filled with Euro trash."
Ron Swanson,Euro trash.
Ron Swanson,I like that.
Ron Swanson,"It is, indeed, a garbage continent."
Typhoon,Yes.
Typhoon,"Oh, my God, I had the worst time in Berlin last May."
Typhoon,Everyone was on their stupid bikes.
Typhoon,"I was like, ""Ew""."
Ron Swanson,"Please, talk more about how you hate Europe and bicycles."
Tom Haverford,Sorry about the audible.
Tom Haverford,I just realized Lucy doesn't care about all that flashy stuff.
Tom Haverford,That's not the way to her heart.
Tom Haverford,"Frankly, I'm stunned she's still even into me."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You were right to change course.
Leslie Knope,It was perfect and beautiful.
Leslie Knope,There's still a very big celebration awaiting you and your fiancee.
Tom Haverford,"I think Lucy probably wants to hang, just the two of us."
Tom Haverford,"I'll see you later, Jennifer Knope-ez."
Leslie Knope,"Catch you on the flipside, Tom-egranate Juice."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, not bad."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,Tom got engaged.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's awesome."
Ben Wyatt,"More good news, I finally found someone to be mayor."
Ben Wyatt,Garry.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad we're leaving.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,You know what? I just had an amazing idea.
Ian,Just under the wire.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ian, thank you so much."
Leslie Knope,It's great.
Leslie Knope,"Now, throw it out."
Leslie Knope,"I need a new one, and I need it in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"If you didn't wanna be on call 24/7 for emergencies, then you should not have gone into the high-stakes world of banner making!"
Donna Meagle,What the hell is all this about?
Ben Wyatt,You'll see.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I got to say, that was a heck of a lot of fun."
Choir,All my life--
Jerry Gergich,What on Earth?
Choir,I prayed for someone like you
Leslie Knope,"Happy Inauguration Day, buddy."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie I
Music,"thank God That I That I finally found you All my life, I pray for someone like you And I hope that you feel the same way, too Yes, I pray that you"
Leslie Knope,The passing of our beloved Mayor Gunderson marks the end of an era.
Leslie Knope,But we are about to begin a new chapter in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the new mayor of the great city of Pawnee, Indiana, Garry Gergich!"
Jerry Gergich,I just wanna say
Music,"And I hope that you feel the same way, too"
Jerry Gergich,I'm flying!
Music,"Yes, I pray that you do love me too"
