Leslie Knope,They help friends find happiness.
Leslie Knope,"Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss."

Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents because we were too busy with the campaign I got you something too.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, a bomb?"
Leslie Knope,"It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched on Starz HD."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, that's specific."
Leslie Knope,Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.M.
Leslie Knope,"tonight, and the combination is a fiveletter code that captures the essence of our third date."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So I will see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,Unless You can't crack the code.
Ben Wyatt,I think I can crack the code.
Ben Wyatt,I have no idea what the code is.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, you okay?"
Tom Haverford,Still thinking about your ex?
Chris Traeger,Millicent Gergich has literally torn my heart from my body and replaced it with a thick slab of sadness.
Chris Traeger,I may never smile again.
Tom Haverford,"Cool, so I found a DJ for the dance, and his name is DJ Bluntz."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, this is a publicly funded couples dance."
Chris Traeger,"I don't think it's appropriate for people to be getting ""wet with sound."""
Tom Haverford,"Who's gonna do it, then?"
Chris Traeger,I will.
Chris Traeger,"I certainly have no other plans for Valentine's Day, because I am completely alone."
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll see you later, Chris."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, cool cryptex, can I have it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you can't"
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you get it?
Ben Wyatt,How do you know what a cryptex is?
Andy Dwyer,I know what things are.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie hid the location of our Valentine's meeting place in here."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Ben Wyatt,I tried every fiveletter word that has anything to do with our third date.
Andy Dwyer,Have you tried [Bleep]?
Ben Wyatt,That's a four letter word.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Add an ""s""?"
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it's that.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, I wish I could help you, bro, I don't know if I can."
Andy Dwyer,"You're, like, the second smartest guy I know."
Andy Dwyer,You should go to the first smartest guy I know.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so the clue is inside, but it takes a fiveletter code to open it Andy!"
Ron Swanson,Did you try [bleep]?
Andy Dwyer,Ha!
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, why is that everyone's first suggestion?"
Andy Dwyer,Just smart people.
Ron Swanson,I think I might be able to help you.
Andy Dwyer,Told you.
Ben Wyatt,Let me see it!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're gonna see it."
Andy Dwyer,I'll show you.
Andy Dwyer,I can unroll it.
Andy Dwyer,"""The murals with this heart you see, look to the first, and there your next clue will be."
Ron Swanson,""" The first letter of the name of each mural with a heart on it will spell out the clue."
Ron Swanson,Or some or something.
Ron Swanson,Let's check out the murals.
Chris Traeger,"Happy Valentine's Day, Pawnee."

Chris Traeger,"Anyway, life is fleeting."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,Found a date for Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, well done."
Jerry Gergich,"I put an ad on Craigslist: ""Man seeking man for a night of casual fun."
Jerry Gergich,""" Enrico, he responded right away."
Extra,"I'll meet you inside, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Tom Haverford,You hired a male escort.
Jerry Gergich,A what?
Leslie Knope,Please get your gigolo out of here.
Jerry Gergich,"I uh oh, my God."

Ben Wyatt,""" Great."
Ben Wyatt,I got it from here.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, guys."
Ben Wyatt,I hope I didn't screw up your Valentine's Day too much.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no."
Andy Dwyer,April hates Valentine's Day.
Andy Dwyer,And brunch.
Andy Dwyer,And outside.
Andy Dwyer,And smiling.
Andy Dwyer,She's weird.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,I figured it out.
Ron Swanson,"The letters unscrambled say, ""No food finer."
Ron Swanson,Clue three at J.J.'s Diner.
Ron Swanson,""" How many clues are there, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
April Ludgate,And I brought a bachelor.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,You brought Orin?
Leslie Knope,"Ann is not some weird, morose mummy."
Leslie Knope,"Offense intended, Orin."
Leslie Knope,Let this be a wakeup call about the way you present yourself to the world.
April Ludgate,I think Ann and him would be cute together.
Leslie Knope,I ask you to do one thing.
Leslie Knope,Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,We weren't talking about you.
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Ann Perkins,"Well It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single, and I'm at a couples dance."
Ann Perkins,I can't imagine a more depressing place to be.
Leslie Knope,"What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, did that happen to you?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some fun."
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least the music seems about right."
Leslie Knope,"There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four."
Leslie Knope,Who else do we have?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, taken."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, taken."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken."
Leslie Knope,Uh what's this?
Leslie Knope,P. Hut
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Pizza Hut!"
Leslie Knope,"Hold on Hi, how cute are you?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex."
Extra,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Extra,Nice to meet you.
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Extra,I've heard a lot about you In the last hour.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented."
Leslie Knope,So I'm gonna what?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, someone needs me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now."
Leslie Knope,You crazy kids.
Extra,Okay Okay
Ben Wyatt,There is no food finer.
Ben Wyatt,""" For Leslie, that means whipped cream, or No, it's whipped cream."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna look in the whipped cream cans.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, got some!"
Andy Dwyer,Oh Nothing yet.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, ""something wicked this way comes,"" ""whence you peruse a book with your thumbs."
Ben Wyatt,"""Go to the one who succumbs."
Ben Wyatt,I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ben Wyatt,""" Oh, come on, Leslie, gimme a break."
Ron Swanson,"I hate riddles and other such nonsense, I want that on the record."
Ron Swanson,"But something wicked with a book is my exwife, from the library."
Ron Swanson,Which means I'm the one that succumbs.
Ben Wyatt,Uh I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ron Swanson,""" Good God."
Ron Swanson,That woman is good.
Ron Swanson,"""Follow me to the sheltered snow."
Ron Swanson,Only 22 clues left to go.
Ben Wyatt,""" Well, this is the woman I've chosen to love."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess there's nothing to do but spend the entire night methodically solving this puzzle."
Ben Wyatt,There's no way we'll finish in time.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just make a list of places she and I have been together, and hope we luck out and find the last clue."
Ron Swanson,"We'll split up, cover more ground."
Ron Swanson,Move.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Kriss Kross, can we change up the music?"
Tom Haverford,It kind of sounds like the end of a movie about a monk who killed himself.
Chris Traeger,It is.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, man There's some attractive women here."
Tom Haverford,Why don't you rebound?
Chris Traeger,Nobody here compares to Millicent.
Chris Traeger,Except maybe Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Technically they share 50% of the same DNA.
Tom Haverford,Stop staring at Jerry like that.
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,It's working now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's it going?"
Extra,"It's Valentine's Day, and I'm working the late shift of the snow globe museum, so I'm right where I wanna be."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, um, my girlfriend left a clue here, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, for a scavenger hunt."
Extra,Right.
Extra,You're Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Extra,She said you'd be here by noon.
Extra,Not doing so good.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Kevin."
Extra,I'm supposed to tell you that it's under one of the snow globes.
Extra,But which one?
Extra,"Ooh, I don't know."
Extra,Nope.
Extra,No.
Extra,No.
Extra,You really suck at this.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, why don't you just Tell me where it is and I can get out of here?"
Extra,That would take all the fun out of it.
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Extra,Winner.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, ha, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt,I found it.
Extra,Yep.
Extra,"Oh, wait."
Extra,"No, that might be from another scavenger hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, looks like you already met Jeff."
Extra,"Well, you didn't tell me that your friend was so beautiful."
Ann Perkins,"Aww, thanks, Jeff."
Extra,"Not as beautiful as my sister, but you know the law."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, Jeff."
Leslie Knope,How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here?
Tom Haverford,There's no changing it as long as Chris is depressed.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
Leslie Knope,You go help Ann.
Leslie Knope,"She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards."
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,And April Thanks for nothing.
Leslie Knope,Why should I do anything to help her?
Leslie Knope,"Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you."
Leslie Knope,Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I see you, weirdo."
Ann Perkins,"So Leslie dragged you into this sneaky little fixup scheme, huh?"
Tom Haverford,We're stuck at a Parks and Rec community couples event.
Tom Haverford,What else you gotta do?
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,You're right.
Ann Perkins,"Bring 'em on, Tom."
Harris,I'm Harris.
Harris,Heard you were desperate for a manpiece.
Harris,We in business?
Tom Haverford,"He's 33 years old, still lives with his parents, and he's been to at least 200 Phish concerts"
Harris,Try 308.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna have to pass right now.
Harris,"Your mistake, mama."
Tom Haverford,"So, Bill, this stunning woman saves lives for a living."
Tom Haverford,What do you bring to the table?
Extra,"Uh, where to begin?"
Extra,"Uh, I'm an amateur juggler"
Tom Haverford,"Nope, you shouldn't have begun there."
Tom Haverford,Get out.
Tom Haverford,No one's trying to get with jugglers.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for playing.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, my name is Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie Knope may have left some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.
Extra,She did.
Extra,One second.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Ah .
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your evening.
Andy Dwyer,"Well it always says ""Break glass in case of an emergency."
Andy Dwyer,""" Wait a second."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, there we go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music?"
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You should look on the bright side.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again."
Chris Traeger,"On the contrary, she was faster than I was."
Chris Traeger,I set many personal bests just trying to keep up with her.
Chris Traeger,Which is what I'm worried about.
Chris Traeger,What if she was my personal best?
Leslie Knope,"No, your best is still ahead of you."
Chris Traeger,I am 44 years old.
Leslie Knope,You don't look a day over 30.
Chris Traeger,Most people say 25.
Leslie Knope,Who says that?
Chris Traeger,Lot of people.
Chris Traeger,You don't think that Millicent was my soul mate?
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day old chowder."
Leslie Knope,But it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Buck up.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, I'll try."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men?
Ann Perkins,I have met a lot of different guys tonight.
Leslie Knope,How lucky that that happened to you on Valentine's Day.
Ann Perkins,What's lucky is that I have a best friend who spent her Valentine's Day trying to find me a date.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go home.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Stay.
Ann Perkins,I just I'm gonna go home and watch TV.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second?"
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna throw them on the roof again so I can't leave.
Leslie Knope,You know me too well.
Ann Perkins,You're the best.
Leslie Knope,"It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know."
Leslie Knope,Try to cheer her up.
Leslie Knope,And I can be late meeting Ben.
Leslie Knope,"He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard."
Leslie Knope,"They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky bastard."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,Look at Ann.
Leslie Knope,She's putting on makeup.
Leslie Knope,She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
Leslie Knope,She has a date.
April Ludgate,You don't know that.
Leslie Knope,Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?
Leslie Knope,Because she doesn't want me to know.
Leslie Knope,Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, the music's better."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen Chris?
April Ludgate,"I don't know, maybe he's in the bathroom or something."
Leslie Knope,She's going to meet Chris.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got nine, three and four."
Ron Swanson,"I have 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ron Swanson,I got I got lucky.
Ron Swanson,And I love riddles.
Andy Dwyer,"Yo, found some clues."
Andy Dwyer,Also found this.
Andy Dwyer,Weird stick.
Andy Dwyer,Might be a clue.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Did you find the 25th clue?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I got #8, and #22."
Leslie Knope,"What do you want, April?"
April Ludgate,Leave Ann alone.
April Ludgate,This is none of your business.
Leslie Knope,"After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss employee thing, it is absolutely my business."
Leslie Knope,"Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices."
April Ludgate,"Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"You guys are such close friends, it's lame."
April Ludgate,"Just have a nice night with Ben, and forget about this."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I will let it go for now.
Leslie Knope,"But I want you to know that I think there is some Okay, she hung up on me."
Ron Swanson,We failed.
Ron Swanson,If I just had a little more time.
Ben Wyatt,"She's waiting for me somewhere in Pawnee, and I'm not gonna be there."
Ron Swanson,"Wait Leslie loves romance, but she also loves being right."
Ron Swanson,"Is there something you used to disagree on, but you've since come around to her way of thinking?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, you're a genius."
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I miss him every day."
Leslie Knope,I really tried to make that hard.
Leslie Knope,I'm very impressed with you.
Ben Wyatt,"Eh, some of them were kind of tough."
Ben Wyatt,So are you ready to go have our first ever Valentine's dinner?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but I have to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Leslie Knope,"Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it."
Leslie Knope,"And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner"
Ben Wyatt,"No, we have to go catch them in the act."
Ben Wyatt,Right now.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Screw romantic dinners.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go rub it in their face.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,Ahh! Shh.
Ben Wyatt,Shh.
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Tom and Ann are on a date.
April Ludgate,I know.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean you know? How do you know?
April Ludgate,Because I set them up.
April Ludgate,I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.
April Ludgate,So I went over to talk to her.
April Ludgate,What are you looking for in a date anyway?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"What does anyone want? Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well."
April Ludgate,"Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well."
Ann Perkins,"Ha, ha."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,"You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight?"
Ann Perkins,He's ridiculous.
Ann Perkins,All that dumb swagger.
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,He's sweet.
April Ludgate,You should just ask him out for a drink.
April Ludgate,"I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes."
April Ludgate,I bet you guys would have a good time.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this."
April Ludgate,Why? It makes sense to me.
April Ludgate,"This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool."
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
April Ludgate,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,You're a very nice person.
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,Very nice person.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Leslie Knope,I do not understand this.
Leslie Knope,This really confuses me.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you do love them both."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
Ben Wyatt,You love Italian men?
Leslie Knope,Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.
Leslie Knope,This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
Tom Haverford,"So, Ann, it's finally happening."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, this is so close to falling apart."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,"Can I be honest, though? I'm a little freaked out."
Tom Haverford,"Like, I don't really understand what's going on."
Ann Perkins,"This is what's going on, we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other."
Ann Perkins,And then I am going to drive home alone.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,"Consider this alternate plan, we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever."
Tom Haverford,Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, this was a mistake."
Tom Haverford,No!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up."
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,"No parties, you hate parties."
Ron Swanson,Correct.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you know that wild goose chase you sent Ben on for Valentine's Day?"
Leslie Knope,The scavenger hunt?
Ron Swanson,I also do not want that.
Leslie Knope,"Yep, I understand."
Ron Swanson,"I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last."
Ron Swanson,You understand what I'm saying?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I got it, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, I, I do want that."
Ron Swanson,Please do that for me.
