Character,Line
Ann Perkins,There is a crazy flu going around.
Ann Perkins,"Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea."
Ann Perkins,"And one of those dehydrated, highfevered, miserable people is April."
Ann Perkins,Who hates me.
April Ludgate,I want another nurse.
Ann Perkins,"Well, there are none."
Ann Perkins,We're stretched pretty thin right now.
April Ludgate,"Then, I want a janitor."
April Ludgate,"They can do what you do, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.
April Ludgate,Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.
Ann Perkins,I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,What are you talking about?
Ann Perkins,That's crazy.
Ann Perkins,And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.
Ann Perkins,Please don't do that.
April Ludgate,Do?
April Ludgate,I can't do anything.
April Ludgate,I'm sick.
April Ludgate,My blankets are on the floor.
Leslie Knope,"So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival."
JJ,"Yeah, I heard you were bringing that back."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
Leslie Knope,"But, I'm just feeling really tired."
Leslie Knope,I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
Leslie Knope,"I've already vomited, like, five times today."
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.
Leslie Knope,And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
JJ,Sure.
JJ,Anything for my favorite customer.
Leslie Knope,I bet you say that to all the girls.
JJ,"Oh, no."
JJ,"No, actually, you're my favorite."
JJ,"You spent over 1,000 dollars last year on waffles alone."
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,"I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick."
Ron Swanson,Woman stuff.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,All my parents got me was that.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, well, I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, so I'm going to go."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here?"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Because of what happened, I don't want him to think--"
Ron Swanson,Stop!
Ron Swanson,Don't want to know.
Ron Swanson,"The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am."
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in caring about people.
Ron Swanson,I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.
Ron Swanson,Best friend I ever had.
Ron Swanson,We still never talk sometimes.
Leslie Knope,"So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but--"
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Go home.
Tom Haverford,You're sick.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sick.
Leslie Knope,It's just allergies.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in there.
Donna Meagle,No.
Jerry Gergich,You can't come in here.
Tom Haverford,You're not coming in.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty."
Leslie Knope,You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,"You want to go there, Jerry?"
Jerry Gergich,No.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'm coming in."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, barricade the door now."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, come on."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in.
Donna Meagle,Mmmmmm.
Tom Haverford,Either go home or go back into quarantine.
Leslie Knope,I'm not going home.
Jerry Gergich,"Get out of here, Leslie."
Donna Meagle,Hit the bricks.
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,She's germing up all my stuff.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, yuck!"
Jerry Gergich,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How was your run?
Chris Traeger,Ended with a five and a half minute mile.
Chris Traeger,My personal low.
Chris Traeger,I think the pavement in this town is soft.
Ann Perkins,What's with the mask?
Chris Traeger,Flu prevention.
Chris Traeger,"My body is finely tuned, like a microchip, and the flu is like a grain of sand."
Ann Perkins,It could literally shut down the entire system.
Ann Perkins,"My body's like a chip, too."
Ann Perkins,A potato chip.
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Definitely.
Ann Perkins,"I'm super, super excited."
Ann Perkins,Looking forward to it.
Chris Traeger,Excellent.
Chris Traeger,"Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger,Way to go.
Ann Perkins,We've been on a couple of dates.
Ann Perkins,I really like him.
Ann Perkins,The problem is he's like a perfect human man.
Ann Perkins,I can't find one flaw.
Ann Perkins,There was one time I thought he farted.
Ann Perkins,But it was me.
Ron Swanson,I need to find someone to fill in for April.
Ron Swanson,"Now, I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic."
Ron Swanson,April really is the whole package.
Ron Swanson,But I think I might know someone who will be just as ineffective.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,What's new?
Andy Dwyer,A whole lot!
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,I just invented it.
Ron Swanson,Superstraw.
Ron Swanson,"So, just sit here and do your thing."
Andy Dwyer,Do I have to tuck my shirt in?
Andy Dwyer,"Because, honestly, that's kind of a deal breaker."
Ron Swanson,Let it fly.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, wait."
Andy Dwyer,Where is April?
Andy Dwyer,Is she all right?
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I just gave her the day off.
Andy Dwyer,Would it be weird if I asked for the day off?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, no, it's okay."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think so.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Are you leaving?
Ben Wyatt,I thought we had a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"No, we do."
Leslie Knope,It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,Your eyes are glassy.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my Is she Is she sick?"
Chris Traeger,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,She's sick.
Tom Haverford,"That's why I'm wearing this, and misting myself with hand sanitizer."
Leslie Knope,I am not sick.
Leslie Knope,"I just have allergies, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I took a Claritin and I threw that up, so I took another one."
Leslie Knope,I threw that up.
Leslie Knope,"And then, I took a third and it stayed down."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting better.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,I have to get out of here.
Chris Traeger,I have 2.8% body fat.
Chris Traeger,My body is like a microchip.
Chris Traeger,A grain of sand could destroy it.
Chris Traeger,My body's a microchip.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, go home."
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't go home.
Leslie Knope,I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
Ben Wyatt,Commerce.
Leslie Knope,"If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins."
Leslie Knope,I cannot go home.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, then, who's your doctor?"
Leslie Knope,Ann's my doctor.
Leslie Knope,And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm hot."
Leslie Knope,"Now, it's really hot in here."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's your fever."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have ""network connectivity problems""."
Ann Perkins,104.1
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you're dehydrated."
Ann Perkins,I'm admitting you.
Leslie Knope,"If I was sick, could I do this?"
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Cartwheels.
Leslie Knope,Am I not doing them?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, don't worry."
Ben Wyatt,"I've done presentations like this before, and Tom will be with me."
Ben Wyatt,"So, you're in good hands."
Leslie Knope,It's not that I don't trust Ben.
Leslie Knope,It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
Leslie Knope,"And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is."
Ben Wyatt,I'll handle the general outline.
Ben Wyatt,If you want to just jump right in.
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,The worst thing you can do with an important presentation like this is overprepare.
Tom Haverford,"So, I think it's best if I go to the spa."
Ben Wyatt,"No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting."
Tom Haverford,"No, Ben."
Tom Haverford,You promised Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"See, I never promise Leslie anything."
Tom Haverford,"That way, I never disappoint her."
Tom Haverford,I try to be considerate.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I am off for a soak and a schvitz."
Tom Haverford,Arrivederch.
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson's office.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I will transfer you."
Andy Dwyer,I just dropped another call.
Ann Perkins,I thought you might like a fresh set of pillows.
April Ludgate,Are you trying to smother me?
April Ludgate,Help!
April Ludgate,This slutty nurse is trying to smother me to death with a pillow!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, never mind."
April Ludgate,"Stay back, slut!"
Ann Perkins,I know what she's trying to do.
Ann Perkins,She's trying to get me to break.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to do it.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to be professional and I'm going to put on a happy face.
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm going to go into a supply closet and snap a bunch of tongue depressors."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk about your opening remarks."
Leslie Knope,Do you want me to write you a rap?
Leslie Knope,I'll write you a rap.
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You're never going to be able to pull it off.
Leslie Knope,You're too white.
Leslie Knope,How about a show tune or something?
Ben Wyatt,"I was just planning to introduce myself, nonmusically, and then, get everyone to refer to their packets."
Ben Wyatt,"And blah, blah, blah."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No ""blah, blah, blah"", okay?"
Ben Wyatt,You need to go over every single detail with me.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I promise you I won't halfass this."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Now, get some rest."
Leslie Knope,I have some great news.
Leslie Knope,I think my fever just broke.
Ben Wyatt,Goodbye.
Andy Dwyer,It just came out.
Ron Swanson,I am starving.
Ron Swanson,I haven't had lunch since yesterday.
Ron Swanson,"So, I'm going to head over to Callahan's."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,Don't go there.
Andy Dwyer,They totally skimp on pickles.
Andy Dwyer,Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you.
Andy Dwyer,They have the most insane burritos.
Ron Swanson,I don't much go for ethnic food.
Andy Dwyer,"No, trust me."
Andy Dwyer,"They have one that's called the ""Meat Tornado""."
Andy Dwyer,It literally killed a guy last year.
Ron Swanson,"You had me at ""Meat Tornado""."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,That flu medicine really helped.
Leslie Knope,I feel a thousand percent better.
Leslie Knope,Good as new.
Leslie Knope,Does this scarf look okay?
Leslie Knope,I don't want to look stuffy.
Leslie Knope,"But I also don't want to look too ""schlubby""."
Ann Perkins,Get back in that bed.
Leslie Knope,So no to the scarf?
Ann Perkins,Get back in the bed.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm going to that meeting."
Ann Perkins,"Either you get back in the bed, or I will strap you down."
Ann Perkins,I've done it before.
Ann Perkins,Don't test me.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, okay."
Tom Haverford,"Now, what superpower would you rather have?"
Tom Haverford,Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?
Tom Haverford,"Ed, go first."
Extra,"Fly, I guess."
Tom Haverford,I forgot to tell you.
Tom Haverford,You can only fly five feet above the ground.
Tom Haverford,I bring a certain panache and spice to the spa experience for these guys.
Tom Haverford,"Before I joined, they were just three old white dudes quietly boiling in hot water."
Tom Haverford,Would you rather live in the pocket of a giant kangaroo or have a pocket on your own stomach that has a tiny kangaroo in it all the time?
Tom Haverford,Preston.
Extra,Tiny kangaroo in my stomach pocket.
Tom Haverford,"Forgot to mention, the tiny kangaroo is a racist."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What happened?
Ann Perkins,"I just saw you a few hours ago, and you were fine."
Ann Perkins,"Not like, ""Damn, you're fine,"" but fine healthwise."
Chris Traeger,My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.
Chris Traeger,Things happen very quickly.
Chris Traeger,Listen to me.
Chris Traeger,It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Chris Traeger,My body tends to lose a lot of fluids when it's sick.
Chris Traeger,My brain is on fire.
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you definitely have the flu."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,The microchip has been compromised.
Andy Dwyer,Pierre Garcon was a sixthround pick.
Ron Swanson,Collie was the fourth round.
Andy Dwyer,Indianapolis Colts know how to draft so well.
Ron Swanson,They really do.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, this was delicious."
Andy Dwyer,"It's awesome, huh?"
Ron Swanson,It's a whole new meat delivery system.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say we go out to the parking lot, run a few pass plays to burn off the calories?"
Ron Swanson,You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
Ron Swanson,I like Andy.
Ron Swanson,I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department.
Ron Swanson,And that includes the men.
Ron Swanson,"Hup, hup, hup!"
Andy Dwyer,Peyton Manning reading the defense!
Andy Dwyer,"Reggie Wayne, Colts corner!"
Ron Swanson,"Andy, wait up!"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,I saw that you called for me.
Ann Perkins,What can I do for you?
April Ludgate,I need more flu medicine.
Ann Perkins,An actual request.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you can't have any."
Ann Perkins,"That stuff is powerful, no extra doses."
April Ludgate,I didn't take any.
April Ludgate,Leslie came in here and stole it and left.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, have you seen Leslie?"
Chris Traeger,"I had a dream that she came into this room, stole my flu medicine, told me not to tell you, and then disappeared through that hole in the wall."
Ann Perkins,The door?
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe we should get, like, a suite here for them, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt!
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Good to see you.
Ben Wyatt,"You, too."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you're really burning up."
Leslie Knope,"Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please?"
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,How much?
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Do you know the exchange rate?
Leslie Knope,So should we do this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,Be careful.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,The floor and the wall just switched.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Walk very carefully.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I find it a little insulting that you don't trust me to handle this."
Leslie Knope,"It's not that I don't trust you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
Leslie Knope,It's my career on the line.
Leslie Knope,And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's show time.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Monster.
Leslie Knope,And this is Nightline.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I wouldn't open with that."
Leslie Knope,No?
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we sit down.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Libertarianism is all about individual liberty.
Ron Swanson,"And it should never be defined by the terms ""liberal"" or ""conservative."""
Andy Dwyer,"And communism is no good, right?"
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,Big swing and a miss.
Andy Dwyer,And what's the word for when a few clerics are in charge?
Andy Dwyer,Religious oligarchy.
Andy Dwyer,I can remember things.
Ron Swanson,I guess.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, keep mine rare."
Ron Swanson,A man after my own heart.
Chris Traeger,I vomited somewhere in this room.
Chris Traeger,"I don't remember where, though."
Chris Traeger,Wait.
Chris Traeger,You might want to check that drawer.
Chris Traeger,Stop pooping.
Ann Perkins,You have to get up off the floor now.
Chris Traeger,This floor is my friend.
Ann Perkins,Nothing like a complete physical breakdown to make a guy seem less intimidating.
Ann Perkins,I love the flu.
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""You know what?"
Tom Haverford,"""I think we need to get these bananas out of here."""
Tom Haverford,"Have a seat, boys."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Tom, glad you could make it."
Ben Wyatt,You have a nice day with your spa buddies?
Tom Haverford,"Actually, yes, Ben, I did."
Tom Haverford,"And my spa buddies own a couple of car dealerships in town, and they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for Harvest Festival, twenty five vans for the entire event."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,Get up there and introduce me.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,"I can't let you do this, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron, can I ask you a question?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,It's about April.
Ron Swanson,I don't like to get involved in people's personal
Andy Dwyer,"I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me."
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand, but she's avoiding me."
Andy Dwyer,It's making me miserable.
Ron Swanson,"April's in the hospital, sick with the flu."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I knew it!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know that.
Andy Dwyer,Is she okay?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, she's fine."
Ron Swanson,You can go visit her tomorrow morning.
Ron Swanson,But don't tell her I told you.
Andy Dwyer,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Before we get started, a quick announcement."
Tom Haverford,Every Thursday night is ladies' night down at the Snakehole Lounge over on Burnham Avenue.
Tom Haverford,Ladies get two drinks for the price of one.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, that can't be right."
Tom Haverford,That's way too good of a deal.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,That is what it says.
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,That sounds like a fun time.
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, it is now my great honor to welcome to the stage the woman responsible for the entire Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!"
Leslie Knope,"Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight, has already made history."
Leslie Knope,"In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone of Pawnee's smallbusiness community, a weeklong showcase for everything from textiles to small farms."
Leslie Knope,"By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable."
April Ludgate,What?
Ann Perkins,"Three, two, one."
Ann Perkins,And my shift's over.
Ann Perkins,What the [bleep] is your problem?
April Ludgate,Whoa I thought you weren't gonna lose it.
Ann Perkins,"Well I was on duty, I didn't."
Ann Perkins,Now it's just me.
Ann Perkins,"I get that you're mad that I kissed Andy, okay? But it was a moment of confusion, and it was a mistake."
Ann Perkins,And I'm very sorry.
Ann Perkins,You want to hate me forever?
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Fine! You know what? I don't care.
Ann Perkins,"But you shouldn't take it out on Andy, because he really likes you, and he did nothing wrong."
Ann Perkins,"And just for the record, I'm starting to hate you, too."
April Ludgate,That's the most I've ever liked Ann.
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Leslie Knope,The place is Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Let's make history.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That was amazing.
Ben Wyatt,That was a flu-ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals.
Ben Wyatt,That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley.
Ben Wyatt,That was That was Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Any questions? Yes sir?
Extra,Are we going to get the same sales-tax incentives we used to?
Leslie Knope,"That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is, why is half of your face all swirly?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, unfortunately, Leslie has another very important meeting right now. So if you have any other questions, you can just direct them towards me."
Leslie Knope,"Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's Excuse me."
Ben Wyatt,"And to answer your question, sir, there will be sales-tax incentives this year."
Tom Haverford,I think I should drive you to the hospital.
Leslie Knope,"Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here? Because if you happen upon it, will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, there."
Ben Wyatt,"I got you some waffles here, courtesy of JJ's diner, and chicken soup, courtesy of me."
Leslie Knope,I'll take the waffles.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So how did the rest of the meeting go?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"We have 110, and counting."
Ben Wyatt,"So, nice work, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Nice work to you too.
Ben Wyatt,"Left the chicken soup there, just in case."
Ben Wyatt,It's an old family recipe.
Ben Wyatt,"It's not a big deal, but."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for that.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, April."
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Just stay sleeping.
Andy Dwyer,I am going to be here when you wake up.
Andy Dwyer,I will not leave your side.
Andy Dwyer,You could be asleep for hours.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I'll come back later.
Andy Dwyer,Hope you feel better.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"And I know you think that I'm a jerk, but I hope you can forgive me."
Andy Dwyer,Gross.
Andy Dwyer,Your forehead is all sweaty.
Andy Dwyer,That's gross.
Andy Dwyer,But I still like you.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That's disgusting.
Ben Wyatt,Got your message.
Chris Traeger,What's up? I got a call from the boys upstairs.
Chris Traeger,And they have a new assignment for us.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,And I feel like we should ask for an extension to stay here.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, definitely."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, the festival thing's getting pretty huge, and a couple loose ends that need tying up."
Chris Traeger,"Good, so I'll make the call then, to get the extension?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they need our help."
Chris Traeger,For the loose ends.
Chris Traeger,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need a ride back to the office?"
Chris Traeger,"No, no, I'm gonna go for a light 15k."
Chris Traeger,I missed yesterday.
Chris Traeger,"Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger,Way to go.
