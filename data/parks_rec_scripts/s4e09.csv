Ron Swanson,April!
Ron Swanson,"Listen, I was trying to buy this handcrafted mahogany wood model of a B25 Mitchell Panchito aircraft."
April Ludgate,"Aw, for me?"
Ron Swanson,Don't sass me.
Ron Swanson,"And I went to this website, and this ad popped up that said ""Hey, Ron Swanson!"""
Ron Swanson,"""Check out this great offer."""
April Ludgate,What's your question?
Ron Swanson,"My question is, what the hell?"
April Ludgate,"Like, how did they know who you are?"
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Um, there are these things called cookies, where, like you go to a site and buy something, it'll remember you and then create ads for other stuff you might want to buy."
Ron Swanson,So it learns information?
Ron Swanson,About me?
Ron Swanson,That seems like an invasion of privacy.
April Ludgate,"Dude, if you think that's bad, go to Google Earth and type in your address."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year."
Chris Traeger,"I am, of course, shocked And not just because Ben usually prefers tall brunettes."
Ben Wyatt,We're very sorry for the position this puts you in.
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Are you hugging me, or are we fighting?"
Leslie Knope,Are you hugging or fighting?
Leslie Knope,Let me know.
Chris Traeger,Neither of those things.
Chris Traeger,I love both of you.
Chris Traeger,You are exemplary government employees.
Leslie Knope,"""Exemplary""?"
Leslie Knope,That's the word we were thinking of.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's true."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Chris Traeger,Which makes what I'm about to say even sadder.
Leslie Knope,Then don't say it.
Chris Traeger,I'm launching a full investigation into the extent of your wrongdoing.
Chris Traeger,Please report Monday first thing to the council chambers for your ethics trial and subsequent punishment.
Ben Wyatt,I told you we'd feel better.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,It's 6:30 in the morning.
Ben Wyatt,Your hearing doesn't start for another two hours.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room."
Leslie Knope,So you got here at 3:00 A.M.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't sleep anyway.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wanted to sneak in before you got here an absurd pipe dream I now realize was impossible."
Leslie Knope,Is that a present for me?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I had him made for you at the toy store."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,I was talking to him.
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Leslie Knope,But also to you.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,I wish we could go through this together.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it's going to be okay."
Ben Wyatt,"You're just gonna get a slap on the wrist, maybe a brief suspension."
Leslie Knope,That's not okay.
Leslie Knope,That's gonna go on my permanent record.
Leslie Knope,I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
Leslie Knope,"For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts."
Ben Wyatt,I know it is.
Leslie Knope,What's gonna happen to you?
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about me.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I'll be outside all day, right on the other side of that wall."
Ben Wyatt,"So, if you miss me, you just look at this Wrinkled, hideous monster and you'll know I'm sitting there rooting for you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
Leslie Knope,"His nickname was ""Old Stone Face"" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,Good morning!
Chris Traeger,It is snowing outside.
Chris Traeger,Isn't that great?
Leslie Knope,You seem like you're in a good mood.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, I'm quite miserable."
Chris Traeger,"I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness."
Chris Traeger,I have never felt so low.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're radiating pure joy."
Chris Traeger,I went to my herbalist and got two B12 shots.
Chris Traeger,"And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St. John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums."
Chris Traeger,And now my mouth feels like a spaceship.
Chris Traeger,This is stressful.
Chris Traeger,And stress leads to depression.
Chris Traeger,"And if I don't mantain an extremely high dosages of herbal remedies, I will get very depressed."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,It's happening right now.
Extra,"We are here today to determine whether Leslie Knope violated any municipal rules or laws due to her romantic relationship with her superior Ben Wyatt, whose hearing will be held tomorrow."
Extra,Would you like to make a statement at this time?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule."
Leslie Knope,But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
Leslie Knope,"In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class ""A"" felony."
Leslie Knope,"Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle."
Leslie Knope,Look how calm she looks.
Leslie Knope,That's how I feel totally zen.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, on what day did your relationship with Ben Wyatt begin?"
Leslie Knope,"Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament."
Leslie Knope,The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
Leslie Knope,It was excellent.
Leslie Knope,That was unnecessary to add.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Chris Traeger,Next question did you ever receive special treatment as a result of your relationship with Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you mean professionally."
Leslie Knope,No.
Chris Traeger,"And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your relationship with Ben Wyatt?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, that is all."
Extra,"Mr. Traeger, this says you're gonna be calling 14 witnesses."
Extra,Is that correct?
Chris Traeger,"Uh, yes, sir."
Leslie Knope,Why so many?
Leslie Knope,I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
Chris Traeger,"It's not my rule, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,It is an important rule that exists in every government.
Chris Traeger,"Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds."
Leslie Knope,And you think I'm guilty of that?
Chris Traeger,I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.
Chris Traeger,"I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery."
Leslie Knope,None of those things are true.
Leslie Knope,"And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger."
Extra,"Okay, ten minute break please."
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, boss."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I need evidence."
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,You don't know what evidence.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, right on."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Hit me.
Leslie Knope,Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician Bella Abzug.
Leslie Knope,Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
Leslie Knope,It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files pay attention.
Leslie Knope,Where are you looking?
Leslie Knope,"Look here, focus here."
Leslie Knope,"Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office."
Andy Dwyer,Put the files in the drawer.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'll go with him."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses."
Leslie Knope,I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
Ron Swanson,I don't know the names of the other department heads.
Donna Meagle,I'll go with him.
Donna Meagle,Seriously?
Donna Meagle,With the men in this office?
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,I need you to text me every 30 seconds that everything's gonna be okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist."
Leslie Knope,But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,You go down in history as a frozen whore.
Leslie Knope,I'm fighting.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, grab my computer."
Ann Perkins,I'm all set.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,You're up next.
Leslie Knope,How is Ben?
Leslie Knope,Is he sad?
Leslie Knope,"You need to cheer him up, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Ben is fine.
Ann Perkins,He says he's sorry he's not in here.
Ann Perkins,He said to look at the monster.
Ann Perkins,I'm hoping you know what that means.
Ron Swanson,There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.
Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him."
Ron Swanson,With pleasure.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Let me make it clear.
Leslie Knope,Don't silence him.
Leslie Knope,Just make sure he can't talk.
Extra,"Okay, we're back."
Extra,"Clear this chamber, please."
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled ""yay""."
Leslie Knope,"That's YA and 18 ""Y""s and 44 exclamation points."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, it is an email from you."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and there's an attachment."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Intriguing.
Leslie Knope,"Could you play the attachment, please?"
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Leslie Knope,In a world on the brink of financial meltdown... In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States
Leslie Knope,what?
Leslie Knope,went from being friends to being so much more.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ben and I hooked up last night!
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,And I learned how to use iMovie.
Leslie Knope,Call me later!
Leslie Knope,Bye!
Leslie Knope,So what was the date you received that email?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, May 12th."
Leslie Knope,May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Chris Traeger,"Mr. Haverford, would you consider Leslie Knope a good employee?"
Tom Haverford,Did Tom Ford turn around the House of Gucci?
Chris Traeger,"I do not know, but I'll assume that that is a yes."
Chris Traeger,How long were you two lovers?
Tom Haverford,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss."
Chris Traeger,It seems that Ms.
Chris Traeger,Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her coworkers.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?"
Tom Haverford,An online dating site randomly paired us up.
Tom Haverford,"So, as a joke, I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating."
Tom Haverford,And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.
Leslie Knope,But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
Tom Haverford,"No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt."
Leslie Knope,"No, it wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we've been at it for hours."
Leslie Knope,And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
April Ludgate,I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.
April Ludgate,Ethel Beavers did it!
April Ludgate,Beavers did it!
Extra,Sit down.
April Ludgate,I will hold myself in contempt of the court!
Andy Dwyer,Is this about the laptop?
Andy Dwyer,I didn't mean to steal it.
Andy Dwyer,"I took it home, and I spaced."
Andy Dwyer,I forgot.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna bring it back.
Andy Dwyer,"It totally works, but I got spaghetti in the keyboard."
Chris Traeger,What laptop?
Andy Dwyer,Objection.
Leslie Knope,"But other than that, I think I'm winning."
Leslie Knope,I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
Chris Traeger,I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.
Chris Traeger,Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?"
Donna Meagle,"Um, khakis and buttondown shirts your basic white people clothes."
Leslie Knope,"And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?"
Leslie Knope,Did it look like anything romantic had happened?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
Donna Meagle,"I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room."
Donna Meagle,It kind of looked like an office.
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was an office.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an allnighter."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
Leslie Knope,"I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off bigtime."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, we got the gramps grants."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials."
Leslie Knope,What do you think my chances are?
Ethel Beavers,I'd say it's 50/50.
Ethel Beavers,"You want to put money on it, I'll give you 60/40 against."
Leslie Knope,Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing?
Ethel Beavers,You tell me.
Ethel Beavers,You're the one on trial.
Extra,"Ron Swanson to the stand, please."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended."
Leslie Knope,Can you confirm that you own a cabin at 930
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Stop, please."
Ron Swanson,"I don't like to give out my address to anyone, much less have it on an official record."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't be ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,This is very important.
Leslie Knope,Do you own a cabin
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Leslie Knope,9301 Cedarcrest Drive
Ron Swanson,Beep!
Ethel Beavers,I didn't hear that.
Ron Swanson,She's here.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy two.
Ron Swanson,I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Chris Traeger,"Good nose, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Tammy Swanson is here.
Chris Traeger,She'll be my next witness.
Leslie Knope,Tammy two is your killer witness?
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,"You're gonna have to do better Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything A pretty good killer witness."
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Swanson, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law breaking?"
Tammy 2,Absolutely.
Tammy 2,I have several photographs that will definitively prove
Chris Traeger,"May I remind you that you are under oath, and if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted."
Tammy 2,Nothing.
Tammy 2,They will definitively prove nothing.
Tammy 2,You cut me off.
Tammy 2,I don't have any evidence.
Tammy 2,"Oh, Chris so silly."
Tammy 2,"Okay, bye, guys."
Tammy 2,"Leslie, have fun with this trial."
Tammy 2,Yay!
Leslie Knope,I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
Chris Traeger,And I am very happy that I have not uncovered any additional evidence of unethical behavior.
Chris Traeger,But II do have one last witness George Williams from Public Works.
Leslie Knope,George Williams?
Leslie Knope,"Who's Oh, George Williams He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe."
Leslie Knope,"And, oh, interesting tidbit I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet."
Chris Traeger,You're saying that you saw Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope kissing at Li'l Sebastian's memorial?
George Williams,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,Can you identify Leslie Knope in this chamber?
George Williams,She's right there.
Leslie Knope,Right
Chris Traeger,And what happened after this incident?
George Williams,"Well, I got real nervous."
George Williams,"They came up to me, and they told me to forget what I saw."
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate, actually, for you."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
George Williams,And then they gave me a $50 gift certificate to a spa and said
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Chris Traeger,And did you use it?
George Williams,Yeah.
George Williams,I got a facial.
George Williams,My wife said my skin was luminous.
Chris Traeger,That's enough.
Chris Traeger,"Now, in order to cover up their illicit affair, Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope bribed a city employee."
Leslie Knope,"George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses."
Leslie Knope,Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses?
George Williams,I never wear 'em on the job.
Leslie Knope,"Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us?"
George Williams,"""I could read this if I weren't so blind."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, that went terribly."
Leslie Knope,I need to check some facts and figures.
Leslie Knope,I would like to request a 55 day recess.
Extra,"You can have 30 minutes, but we're nearing the end here, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me."
Leslie Knope,"So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, mine doesn't have any pictures."
Leslie Knope,Does anyone have anything?
Leslie Knope,Did anybody find anything good?
Ron Swanson,"In 1856, the city council banned all sexual positions except for missionary."
Ron Swanson,"And two years later, they banned missionary."
Tom Haverford,"1882, should a Presbyterian speak out of turn, he may be caned across the shinbone."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,Black people still can't legally use city sidewalks.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this."
Leslie Knope,Can somebody go get him?
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll go."
April Ludgate,"""Any woman caught laughing is a witch."""
April Ludgate,That's true.
Donna Meagle,"Um, he's not there."
Leslie Knope,"No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall."
Leslie Knope,He's probably in the bathroom.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll find him."
Leslie Knope,"This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
Leslie Knope,And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
Leslie Knope,I'm on the bad side.
Ron Swanson,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm guilty.
Leslie Knope,I did something bad.
Leslie Knope,I'm a bad person.
Ron Swanson,It's not that simple.
Ron Swanson,You know what makes a good person good?
Ron Swanson,"When a good person does something bad, they own up to it."
Ron Swanson,"They try to learn something from it, and they move on."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, everybody stop reading no more loopholes, no more fighting."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure, boss?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I know I let you down.
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, what are you talking about?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, this makes me like you more."
Tom Haverford,Bribing someone to hide a sexcapade I'm proud to call you a friend.
Andy Dwyer,And I always liked you.
Extra,"Okay, we're back."
Extra,"Clear the chamber, please."
Leslie Knope,"I think I'm about to get fired, Ron."
Extra,"Ms. Knope, unless you have any objections, we'll be ending this investigation and moving on to the punishment phase."
Leslie Knope,I have no objections.
Extra,We hereby hand down the following judgment.
Extra,You will be suspended for two weeks with pay.
Leslie Knope,Just two weeks?
Extra,Correct.
Extra,This concludes the investigation.
Leslie Knope,I thought I was gonna get fired.
Leslie Knope,I should've gotten fired.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't I get fired?
Chris Traeger,"Ben asked for a private meeting with the committee, and he took full responsibility for the bribe and resigned, effective immediately."
Leslie Knope,What? Wait.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,You can't let him resign.
Chris Traeger,"I tried to talk him out of it, but His mind was made up."
Chris Traeger,"Look, my job is to protect the government from fraud and corruption."
Chris Traeger,I was just doing my job.
Chris Traeger,I hope that you can understand that.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I do."
Chris Traeger,"'Cause your actions wounded me to my core, which is not easy since the bulk of my workouts are focused on core strengthening."
Chris Traeger,But we will get through this.
Chris Traeger,You are An excellent government employee.
Chris Traeger,"And more importantly, you're the only person I've ever met who's worthy of being Ben's girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,I hope that's true.
Chris Traeger,"You know, the meeting that Ben and I had"
Chris Traeger,it's on the record.
Chris Traeger,You should take a look at the last page of the transcript.
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Wyatt: Chris, for God's sake, would you mind not jumping for a while?"""
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Traeger: Sorry, Ben, but"""
Chris Traeger,This is how I fight depression.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, fine."
Chris Traeger,I'll stop.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, so you are prepared to resign, effective immediately, and take full responsibility for all the events that transpired at Li'l Sebastian's memorial."
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Wyatt: That is correct."""
Ben Wyatt,That is correct.
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Traeger: Okay, fine."""
Ethel Beavers,"""This makes me sadder than I previously thought"""
Ethel Beavers,"humanly possible, but I accept your resignation."
Ethel Beavers,"Can I ask you one more question?"""
Chris Traeger,"Was all of this, all the sneaking around, the scandal, losing your job, Was it worth it?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,It was.
Ethel Beavers,"""Because I love Leslie."""
Ethel Beavers,""" I want to be with her."""
Ethel Beavers,"""And I don't want to hide the way I feel about her anymore."""
Ethel Beavers,"""So, yeah, it was worth it, because I'm in love with Leslie Knope."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Traeger: That was beautiful."""
Ethel Beavers,"""I'm literally crying and jumping."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Crying noise, crying noise, nose blow."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Wyatt: It's gonna be okay."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Mr. Traeger"""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh Let it out, I guess."
Ethel Beavers,"""End transcript."""
Leslie Knope,"Hi, honey, how was your day?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I've had better."
Ben Wyatt,How about you?
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you did that for me.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was pretty sure it was gonna happen one way or the other."
Ben Wyatt,I hope it doesn't affect your campaign.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about that right now.
Leslie Knope,There was a piece of testimony that came out during the trial that I think you'd be interested in.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel? Ethel, could you please read page 132 of the official testimony?"
Ethel Beavers,"""Ethel Beavers: The official record has now annoyingly been reopened so that Leslie Knope can make a statement."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Leslie Knope: Let the record state that I, Leslie Knope, love Ben Wyatt."""
Ethel Beavers,"""I love him with all of my heart."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Did you get that? Ethel Beavers: Yes, I got it."""
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ethel."
Ethel Beavers,Can I get a ride home? It's freezing.
Leslie Knope,Can you please state your name for the committee?
Jerry Gergich,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You can't even get your own name right.
Jerry Gergich,"Actually, my real name is Gary."
Leslie Knope,Gary?
Jerry Gergich,"On my first day here, the old director, he called me Jerry, and I just didn't think I should correct him."
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Your name is Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,Legally my name is Gary.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich? Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry God, they're both horrible."
Leslie Knope,But Jerry's better.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call you Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, do you remember a time"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I can't get over the Gary/Jerry thing.
Chris Traeger,Neither can I.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, you can go."
Chris Traeger,We need a five-minute break.
