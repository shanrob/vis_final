Jerry Gergich,Are you getting ready with Andy in London?
Jerry Gergich,You look lovely.
April Ludgate,I'm going to murder you a thousand times.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
April Ludgate,What the hell?
Andy Dwyer,"Someone's back from London, no, it's not the queen someone's back from London, it's not Mr. Bean."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"It's not the royal baby, I think his name is Jeff"
April Ludgate,Stop singing!
April Ludgate,Kiss me!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,"Just missed you so bad, honey, I bought myself a ticket home."
Andy Dwyer,"You're never gonna need that computer again 'cause I'm home for, like, 19 hours."
Jerry Gergich,This is so sweet.
Jerry Gergich,Just like the old days.
Andy Dwyer,"Take a hike, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's Larry now.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, take a hike, Larry."
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business, Councilman Jamm proposes Bill 949c."
Jeremy Jamm,"That's right, stretch, and looking mighty fly in that suit, brother."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, this excellent bill only allows someone to vote in a Pawnee election, for example, the upcoming recall election, if their I.D. lists an official Pawnee address."
Leslie Knope,"Really, councilman?"
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,"The recall election is coming up, and Jamm keeps trying to figure out ways to screw me over."
Leslie Knope,"Last week, he tried to have me listed on the ballot as ""Leslie Buttface Hitler the Fourth."""
Leslie Knope,"All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs."
Leslie Knope,I move that we table the discussion until after the election.
Councilman Howser,Second.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Councilman Howser,Ah!
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just get excited when you like me.
Leslie Knope,"I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?"
Leslie Knope,Those are my votes.
Leslie Knope,I've earned them!
Leslie Knope,I want them!
Leslie Knope,Give me those votes!
Ben Wyatt,I don't have them on me.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.
Ben Wyatt,I can.
Ben Wyatt,He's a horrible monster.
Ben Wyatt,But let's focus on the more important issue.
Ben Wyatt,You want to squeeze in one more practice session?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, do I?"
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme."
Leslie Knope,Ben lives for the early '90s.
Leslie Knope,"The music, the fashion."
Leslie Knope,It's his favorite era.
Leslie Knope,As for the roller skating
Ben Wyatt,I have a thing for women in skates.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone has a thing, and that's mine."
Ben Wyatt,"As far as things go, it's pretty innocuous."
Ben Wyatt,"Could be one of those dudes that kisses mannequins or whatever, but I like a woman in skates."
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, Ann called."
April Ludgate,She wants her ugly outfit back.
Ann Perkins,Why are you dressed as a pilgrim?
April Ludgate,"Leslie said it was a ""Come As You Were in the '90s"" party."
April Ludgate,I assumed it was the 1690s.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, if it was the 1690s, we'd all be mummies."
Ann Perkins,What do you think mummies are?
Andy Dwyer,Skeletons?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Nadia Stasky,Hey.
Nadia Stasky,"I just came straight from work, so I couldn't dress up."
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,You look wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wonderful.
Nadia Stasky,Wait a minute.
Nadia Stasky,Pants on backwards.
Nadia Stasky,"Kris Kross, right?"
Nadia Stasky,Nice!
Nadia Stasky,What happens when you have to pee?
Tom Haverford,I actually just went.
Tom Haverford,I had to pull my pants all the way to the ground like a toddler.
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, the super hot doctor, has been hanging out with me for the last week."
Tom Haverford,She's definitely out of my league.
Tom Haverford,"Actually, we're not even playing the same sport."
Tom Haverford,It's kind of like she's in NBA and I work at a muffler store next to the stadium.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe we met just before you have to go on your stupid vacation.
Nadia Stasky,"I'm doing doctors without borders, man."
Nadia Stasky,I'm going to Rwanda.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,That's a stupid vacation.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, why don't you win me that huge-ass bear as a going-away present?"
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,I'm a skee ball master.
Nadia Stasky,No way!
Nadia Stasky,Why don't you go pro?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I didn't want to be a cliche.
Tom Haverford,Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?
Nadia Stasky,Right.
Extra,Now that's what I call shooting.
Ron Swanson,Is this a hunting game?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's fun."
Donna Meagle,You want to play?
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I do."
Ron Swanson,"If you'd like, I could offer you some pointers."
Ron Swanson,"Hunting, Donna, is about silence, balance, and patience."
Extra,Get ready.
Donna Meagle,"You know you're supposed to hit the deer, right?"
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Donna Meagle,"Get it together, Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Well, the game is absurd."
Ron Swanson,"This gun is lightweight, there's no sight, and we are far too close to these deer."
Ron Swanson,Would they not smell us?
Ron Swanson,I want my money back.
Ron Swanson,How do I get my quarters?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,You are such a sore loser.
Ron Swanson,I am not a sore loser.
Ron Swanson,"It's just that I prefer to win, and when I don't, I get furious."
Ron Swanson,Employee!
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,Watch this.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that was brilliant."
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,You probably don't know what that means.
Andy Dwyer,"You know how you Americans say ""cool"" when something's cool?"
Andy Dwyer,"Over in London, we say, ""That's brilliant."""
April Ludgate,"Speaking of London, you haven't told me anything about work."
April Ludgate,You still love it?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's awesome."
Andy Dwyer,I'm kicking ass.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm like Chuck Norris, only instead of crushing bad guys' skulls, I'm crushing documents."
April Ludgate,That's great.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Now be the Chuck Norris of making out with me.
Andy Dwyer,I'll karate punch your face with my tongue.
April Ludgate,Prove it.
Andy Dwyer,Hiyah.
Ben Wyatt,Get this.
Ben Wyatt,I just asked the DJ what REM albums he has.
Ben Wyatt,"He's got Monster, but not Automatic For the People."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, what is this?"
Ben Wyatt,A mid-'90s party?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,It's an early '90s party.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Tell us how this looks.
Leslie Knope,Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.
Leslie Knope,Hit it!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but we have a problem."
Chris Traeger,His name is Jeremy Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, as noted in Article nine, Paragraph two"
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, and I called a special session and untabled it."
Jeremy Jamm,What's up with the roller skates?
Leslie Knope,"I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm a blades guy.
Leslie Knope,Point of order!
Leslie Knope,The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.
Jeremy Jamm,Will the councilwoman yield her time so we can vote on this sucker?
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not yield."
Leslie Knope,Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.
Jeremy Jamm,A filibuster?
Jeremy Jamm,Are you dookin' on my chest right now?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gross!
Leslie Knope,"And yes, it's a filibuster."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I am not willing to let you deprive me
Chris Traeger,She's filibustering on roller skates?
Chris Traeger,She's gonna be strapped into those things for hours.
Ben Wyatt,"I know this is a dire situation, but I swear to God, this is like a crazy sex fantasy for me."
Nadia Stasky,How goes it?
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, except I suck at skee ball."
Nadia Stasky,"Well, that's too bad, 'cause if you don't win me that bear, you're dead to me."
Tom Haverford,Understood.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, how many tickets for that bear, again?"
Morris,"40,000.00"
Tom Haverford,"40,000?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, brother."
Tom Haverford,"All right, you're gonna be my lookout for a second."
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, is he allowed to do that?"
Morris,No!
Morris,"Get off the ramp, dude!"
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,You're supposed to be my lookout.
Nadia Stasky,I thought it'd be funnier to watch you get busted.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're a doctor."
Tom Haverford,You know snitches get stitches.
Leslie Knope,I remember the first time I voted.
Leslie Knope,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five."
Leslie Knope,"I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won."
Leslie Knope,She had more funding.
Leslie Knope,"Politics, right?"
Leslie Knope,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,How long have I been talking?
Leslie Knope,Three hours?
Leslie Knope,"No, eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you should yield the floor.
Jeremy Jamm,Milton doesn't have a lot of time left on earth.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, just kidding, bud."
Councilman Milton,Will someone open my crackers?
Ben Wyatt,The session ends at 11:00 P.M.
Ben Wyatt,She has to talk the whole time.
Ben Wyatt,"She can't lean on anything for support, and no one else can help her."
Ben Wyatt,Three strikes and she is done.
Chris Traeger,This is literally the most exciting thing that I've ever seen.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, think about it."
Chris Traeger,Where else on earth would you rather spend your birthday with Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe the birthday party she's throwing for me right now."
Leslie Knope,Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second."
Jeremy Jamm,"Bam, strike one."
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Leslie Knope,Is the gong really necessary?
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, it is."
Jeremy Jamm,I love Chinese crap.
Jeremy Jamm,"Lucy Liu, Nintendo, Gangnam Style, sushi, et cetera, et cetera."
Jeremy Jamm,"Also, more importantly, it's in the rules."
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,I had this exact bear when I was a kid!
Ann Perkins,Excuse me.
Morris,Uh-huh.
Ann Perkins,How much does this bear cost?
Morris,40000 tickets.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, let's just assume that I'm an adult who doesn't have two weeks to play arcade games."
Ann Perkins,What about 50 bucks?
Morris,Yeah.
Morris,Just don't tell my boss.
Extra,"What are you doing, Morris?"
Morris,"Nothing, Mr. Bonderman."
Extra,Tuck in your shirt.
Extra,God!
Morris,Sorry.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,You feeling it?
Donna Meagle,Wow.
Donna Meagle,You suck at this.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, please back up two paces so I can physically destroy this machine."
Donna Meagle,"Can you chill a little, man?"
Donna Meagle,It's not real hunting.
Donna Meagle,It's just a game.
Donna Meagle,That you happen to suck at.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,That's a good point.
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,That you suck at this?
Ron Swanson,That it's not real hunting.
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
April Ludgate,I don't want you to go back to London.
Andy Dwyer,"Just remember, every time you look up at the moon, I, too, will be looking at a moon."
Andy Dwyer,"Not the same moon, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,That's impossible.
April Ludgate,See you on stupid Skype.
April Ludgate,I'm proud of Andy.
April Ludgate,This is the first time he's really gone out on a limb.
April Ludgate,"I knew if he found something that he actually liked doing, he'd be happy, so I'mâ¦"
April Ludgate,What the hell?
April Ludgate,Wha--
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,Perkins!
Tom Haverford,What are you doing with my bear?
Tom Haverford,"I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia."
Ann Perkins,I just bought it for 50 bucks.
Ann Perkins,"When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was Cockroach from The Cosby Show."
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, what's going on here?"
Nadia Stasky,Why does blossom have my bear?
Ann Perkins,"I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,"I still got some tickets, though."
Tom Haverford,"I could get you, uh, a ninja turtle balloon or Cliffhanger on VHS."
Nadia Stasky,"Oh, that's so sweet, but you're basically offering me garbage."
Nadia Stasky,Let's just skate.
Tom Haverford,That bear was the only thing she was gonna have to remember me by in Rwanda.
Tom Haverford,"And if I know anything about Rwanda, and I don't, I bet it's full of rich guys who'll buy her whatever she wants."
Ron Swanson,Hunting.
Ron Swanson,No quarters required.
Donna Meagle,Hang on.
Donna Meagle,Do you have a license to hunt at night?
Donna Meagle,'Cause you need a license.
Ron Swanson,I thought you were serious.
Donna Meagle,Come on now.
Donna Meagle,You know I don't give a [bleep].
Leslie Knope,"As Ronald Reagan would say, ""Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else think it's hot in here?
Leslie Knope,These overalls are really starchy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand."
Jeremy Jamm,Oops.
Leslie Knope,"Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's whitehot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, this is not a good sign."
Ben Wyatt,"Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake."
Leslie Knope,Democracy is not unlike a cake.
Leslie Knope,"It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, she's fading."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, we need to find a way to smuggle some mineral oil drops onto her tongue."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Excuse me.
Extra,What the hell are you people doing here?
Extra,We represent the citizens of former Eagleton.
Extra,We're here to support Leslie Knope for preserving our voting rights.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,You are all warriors of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, ""All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence."""
Leslie Knope,And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Second wind!
April Ludgate,"Andy, I know you're in there."
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey."
Andy Dwyer,I was just... just here in this dumpster 'cause I jumped in.
April Ludgate,Get out!
April Ludgate,We need to talk.
Andy Dwyer,About what?
Ron Swanson,"Fresh air, real weapons, an honest kill."
Ron Swanson,There is no substitute for the real thing.
Donna Meagle,"You want to go back and play that video game, don't you?"
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,Damn it!
Chris Traeger,It is so inspiring to see Eagletonians putting aside their prejudices.
Chris Traeger,"With support like this, Leslie Knope may stand a fighting chance on recall day."
Chris Traeger,Permission to hug you.
Extra,Granted.
Extra,"I should mention, though, that we're not voting to keep Leslie."
Chris Traeger,What?
Extra,We want someone from Eagleton to represent our interests on the new city council.
Chris Traeger,"Sir, I formally revoke our hug."
Extra,"Well, you can't."
Extra,It happened.
Leslie Knope,"We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston."
Leslie Knope,One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you're not allowed to receive help from the crowd."
Jeremy Jamm,That's strike two.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, man, leave my gong alone."
Jeremy Jamm,The reverb is the best part.
Leslie Knope,"If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?"
Extra,Eagleton!
Extra,Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope!"
Jeremy Jamm,Wrap it up!
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna yield.
Leslie Knope,I justâ¦ I need some time to think.
Leslie Knope,"And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?"
Leslie Knope,So they can't vote.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, dadoy."
Jeremy Jamm,Yield.
Leslie Knope,"Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if I lose.
Leslie Knope,No one prevents people in my town from voting.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,The filibuster is on!
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I can't go back to London.
Andy Dwyer,I'm totally in over my head on this project.
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, someone comes up to me and says, ""I need your approval on this, Mr. Dywer."""
Andy Dwyer,"""I need your signature, Mr. Dwyer."""
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a toilet, Mr. Dwyer."""
April Ludgate,But you said everything was going awesome.
April Ludgate,You said you were like Chuck Norris.
Andy Dwyer,"I am, but I'm like Chuck Norris now-- some old guy with a beard who used to be good at karate but became a dumb has-been and is scared and confused about his big London job."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,The parallels between he and I are very eerie.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna tell you a secret about everyone else's job.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,No one knows what they're doing.
April Ludgate,I don't know how to run an animal control department.
April Ludgate,Half the documents I get I put right into the shredder because they're so boring.
Andy Dwyer,But you seem like you do know what you're doing.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I seem like it."
April Ludgate,"Deep down, everyone is just faking it until they figure it out."
April Ludgate,"And you will too, because you are awesome and everyone else sucks."
Ben Wyatt,30 minutes to go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, it's so hot."
Leslie Knope,Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.
Jeremy Jamm,"Mm, mm, mm."
Leslie Knope,That's--
Jeremy Jamm,How I know you would love an ice-cold frozen marg.
Leslie Knope,All I want is the promise of democracy.
Jeremy Jamm,Sure about that?
Leslie Knope,I want that marg.
Jeremy Jamm,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,I want that Margarita.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, it's gonna be so good."
Jeremy Jamm,So cold.
Jeremy Jamm,It's so cold.
Leslie Knope,I want to drink it.
Jeremy Jamm,Make that heat go away!
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, get! Come on, girl."
Jeremy Jamm,Get!
Leslie Knope,Give me that Margarita!
Leslie Knope,No! I want votes.
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, worker, bring me a bucket of beers and four hot dogs."
Ron Swanson,"Please, and thank you."
Morris,Why are you covered in blood?
Donna Meagle,Don't worry.
Donna Meagle,It's not human.
Ron Swanson,"I hope you've made peace with your God, small electronic deer."
Donna Meagle,Kill it.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I need that bear."
Tom Haverford,I got to give Nadia something awesome so she'll remember me when she's in Africa.
Ann Perkins,"Tom, bear or no bear, she clearly likes you."
Ann Perkins,"Actually, how do you even get girls like her-- or me-- to go out with you?"
Tom Haverford,Scientists say the emotions of love and hate are very close to each other.
Tom Haverford,That's what I tell women.
Ann Perkins,"The point is, she's leaving in two days."
Ann Perkins,"You want her to remember you? Go spend time with her and do something memorable, dummy!"
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ann."
Tom Haverford,"I know conversations like this are hard for you 'cause you still have feelings for me, but you'll land on your feet, kid."
Ann Perkins,Run or I punch you.
Tom Haverford,No punchies!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, bye for real this time."
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate,I made you five bologna sandwiches in case you get hungry on the way to the airport.
Andy Dwyer,Did you--
April Ludgate,"Yes, I used cookies instead of bread."
Andy Dwyer,You think of everything.
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
April Ludgate,Love you too.
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"Ha! Ha! Found it! I got-- I left my wallet in here earlier, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,Whoo! All good now.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, look! Noodles!"
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, babe."
April Ludgate,"Babe, don't touch those."
Ben Wyatt,I've read the entire charter.
Ben Wyatt,There's no other way to get her a bathroom break unless we bring the bathroom to her-- that's nothing.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, she's not gonna make it."
Chris Traeger,"Look at her, she's dancing around like she's a character in one of those Peanuts cartoons."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope, how you feeling over there? You go pee-pee? Pee-pee times? Make wee-wee?"
Ben Wyatt,Five more seconds.
Extra,"Four, three, two, one!"
Councilman Howser,This session is adjourned.
Councilman Howser,All pending matters are tabled.
Extra,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,You were amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but move! I have to go to the whiz palace."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait!"
Extra,Eagleton! Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,Oh! My beautiful curls!
Ben Wyatt,"She didn't have time to hug me, but she could do that?"
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, Ann, can I talk to you for a second?"
Nadia Stasky,About Tom?
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,You guys look like you're having fun.
Nadia Stasky,"Yeah, no, I really like him."
Nadia Stasky,"I just wanted to say that I think you're really cool, and the fact that Tom dated you makes me think he's a really good guy."
Ann Perkins,That's so sweet.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,Wha--what are you-- - What the hell?
Nadia Stasky,Now!
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ann, this is on you."
Tom Haverford,You told us to make a memory.
Tom Haverford,There's your money back.
Ann Perkins,Let go!
Nadia Stasky,Suck it!
Ann Perkins,This is $8!
Tom Haverford,"Man, that was so much fun."
Nadia Stasky,#NAME?
Nadia Stasky,"Together, we truly did steal a toy from your pregnant friend."
Tom Haverford,#NAME?
Nadia Stasky,Mm-hmm.
Tom Haverford,"I know we just met, like, two weeks ago and whatever, but is there any chance maybe, when you get back, we can maybe--"
Nadia Stasky,Ugh.
Nadia Stasky,Clingy.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no."
Nadia Stasky,I'm kidding.
Nadia Stasky,Of course I'll call you when I come back.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Nadia Stasky,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"So long, suckers!"
Nadia Stasky,Hey! Quick!
Ron Swanson,"Ooh! Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
Extra,Now that's what I call shooting.
Ron Swanson,Come on!
Extra,That's a new record!
Donna Meagle,Hey! Look at that! You finally made it in the top 10.
Donna Meagle,Now you can enter your initials.
Ron Swanson,My initials are private.
Donna Meagle,Then just put in any three letters.
Ron Swanson,Ass.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! That was epic! I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or--"
Ingrid de Forest,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey! Ingrid! I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, she was just telling me she's been nominated to run against you in the recall."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Buzz kill.
Ingrid de Forest,"I know you must hate me right now, Leslie, and that's justified, but I need to thank you for what you just did in there."
Ingrid de Forest,Not the forceful urination.
Ingrid de Forest,The filibuster.
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah."
Ingrid de Forest,"It was incredibly courageous, and it was selfless."
Ingrid de Forest,"And if I do win, I'm gonna have very big roller skates to fill."
Ingrid de Forest,Could I take you out for a celebratory plate of-- I think you call them waffles?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him."
Leslie Knope,"A rain check, maybe."
Ingrid de Forest,Please.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you must be exhausted."
Ben Wyatt,We don't have to go to the party.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're not going to the party."
Leslie Knope,We're going home.
Ben Wyatt,"Then why would you need to put on rollerskates? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! We're just-- we're just-- skates."
