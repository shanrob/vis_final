Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Your worst nightmare.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Screw this.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, income tax is illegal."
Ron Swanson,"Second, Tammy is a psychological mastermind."
Ron Swanson,This is just another way for her to put her hand up my keister and control me like a puppet.
Ron Swanson,I'd rather be locked up.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is a federal tax audit."
Leslie Knope,You could go to jail.
Leslie Knope,"Jail, Ron."

Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Look, we got some documents over at Entertainment720 that seem really complicated."
Tom Haverford,"And I thought, maybe you could take a look at them because nerd stuff probably really excites you, because you're a nerd."
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I just put on my Star Wars pajamas and sit in my mom's basement and pore over some spreadsheets."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds great.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,what'd you got?
Tom Haverford,"Something called ""Break even analysis tables."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, break evens?"
Ben Wyatt,Those are really fun.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sure."
Ben Wyatt,I'll take a look.
Tom Haverford,Let's hit it.
Ben Wyatt,What you right now?
Ben Wyatt,Uh. I have work.
Tom Haverford,And I thought I had a friend.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Tom Haverford,It's almost too easy.
Ben Wyatt,I can hear you.
Tom Haverford,"I know you can, Ben."
Tom Haverford,That's how easy it is.
Ron Swanson,So we need to find proof of every tax deduction I've taken in the last five years.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, most of these aren't even receipts."
Leslie Knope,"This one says, ""I bought supplies. 2007."""
Ron Swanson,You won't find any bank statements either.
Ron Swanson,I've heavily invested in gold which I've buried in several different locations around Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,Or have I?
April Ludgate,What's this?
April Ludgate,Some kind of lame drug deal?
Ron Swanson,That is a gentleman's agreement.
Ron Swanson,I made that man a dining room table in exchange for 60 feet of copper pipe and a half pig.
Leslie Knope,"Well, looks like we have some actual receipts here."
Leslie Knope,"Same amount, every month."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Ron Swanson,"Every 30 days, I buy shotgun shells and cigarettes and send them home to my mom."

Ron Swanson,My first exwife's name is Tammy.
Ron Swanson,My second exwife's name is Tammy.
Ron Swanson,My mom's name is Tamara.

Extra,"You can prevent adultonset diabetes by getting an annual checkup, exercising, praying"
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Who is that guy?
Ann Perkins,That is Walt Morphling.
Ann Perkins,"He was the director of public health, but he had to retire at 46 because he had diabetes."
Chris Traeger,"That is sad, but also, in this town, understandable."
Ann Perkins,"I would like to shoot a new PSA and I think it'd be good to get someone who's healthy and telegenic, and I thought that you would be perfect."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I am flattered.
Chris Traeger,And I will do it.
Chris Traeger,Is there a script yet?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, no, because you just approved the idea, like, three seconds ago."
Chris Traeger,I would like you to write me a script and get it to me in an hour.
Chris Traeger,And we should start thinking about wardrobe.
Chris Traeger,Casual?
Chris Traeger,Formal?
Chris Traeger,Semiformal?
Chris Traeger,Sporty?
Chris Traeger,Scary?
Chris Traeger,Posh?

Chris Traeger,I'm very excited about this.
Chris Traeger,"In terms of shirts, I can wear white"
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to paradise, my man."
Tom Haverford,You can chill over there by the bar.
Tom Haverford,We also got basketball at any time you want.
Tom Haverford,There's Roy Hibbert and Detlef Schrempf.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,That's an actual NBA player.
Ben Wyatt,He plays for the Pacers.
Tom Haverford,"NBA's on strike, so we got him for only, like, 75% of his original NBA salary."
Tom Haverford,"What up, Roy?"
Roy Hibbert,Is this all you want me to do?
Roy Hibbert,Play one on one with Detlef?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,And keep your mouth shut.
Tom Haverford,JeanRalphio!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Take me there.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Bump!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Who are you?
Tom Haverford,Uh This is Ben.
Tom Haverford,He's here to help us with the paperwork.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ben?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that your real name?
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, you could do better than that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'ma help you out right now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Your name is Angelo.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Angelo, thank you so much for coming out."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get a thicker tie.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It looks weird on you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Makes your head look like a fish.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Secondly, I don't know where the paperwork is, but when you find it, can you take care of it for us?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We don't have any pens 'cause we're afraid it's gonna leak in our shirts.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Lastly, I hate the name, Angelo."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'ma switch it up for you, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Your new nickname is Jello shot.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What do you think of that, Jshot?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have questions?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Where are we?
Tom Haverford,"All right, Ben."
Tom Haverford,"If you need anything, one of these models that we pay to hang around here will grab it for you."
Tom Haverford,"In the meantime, we' gonna be playing video games, tweeting our high scores."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hit it!
Ben Wyatt,"Um, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Are you the receptionist?
Extra,I guess.
Extra,I don't really know.
Ben Wyatt,"If you don't mind me asking, how much are they paying you?"
Extra,"$100,000 a year."
Extra,With full medical.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I would guess they'll be bankrupt by the end of This sentence."
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
April Ludgate,Is this true?
April Ludgate,You only spent 40 dollars on clothes in the past 5 years?
Ron Swanson,It sounds about right.
Leslie Knope,How did you meet Tammy One?
Ron Swanson,"Technically, I've known her since I was born."
Ron Swanson,She was a candy striper at the hospital.
Ron Swanson,She helped deliver me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,I grew up in a very small town.
Ron Swanson,Everybody knew everybody else.
Ron Swanson,We first took up together when I was 15.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,"It was a little scandalous, but everyone feared her, so they kept their mouths shut."
April Ludgate,"I don't even know her, but she's my hero."
Ron Swanson,"No, she's no hero, April."
Ron Swanson,She's a hellacious nightmare.
Ron Swanson,"She did, however, teach me everything I know."
Ron Swanson,"Sunday school, sex."
Ron Swanson,"She was my math teacher in middle school and my babysitter, and she taught driver's ed."
Ron Swanson,I Hello.
Leslie Knope,I don't believe we've met.
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, deputy"
Tammy 1,I don't think it will be necessary for you to speak again while I'm here.
Ron Swanson,Why do I only date brunettes?
Ron Swanson,"You know, sometimes you eat chicken and you get food poisoning and then, even the sight of chicken makes you sick?"
Ron Swanson,Tammy One is my blonde chicken.
Tammy 1,"Good God, Ronald."
Tammy 1,This is a much bigger mess than I imagined.
Tammy 1,You'll take a week off from work.
Tammy 1,We'll do a complete overhaul of your finances.
Tammy 1,"I'll need access to all your accounts, and your home."
Ron Swanson,Is that necessary?
Tammy 1,"Oh, oh."
Tammy 1,We're playing a game where everyone says something stupid?
Tammy 1,You.
Tammy 1,What is your name?
Andy Dwyer,Tim.
Andy Dwyer,Tim Buckenowski.
Tammy 1,Really?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Tammy 1,"Andy You're going to collect all of this, and you're going to put it in my car."
Tammy 1,What Ms.
Tammy 1,Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Tammy 1,You're going to go to payroll and get copies of Ronald's workplace expense reports.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, II'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together."
Leslie Knope,It's called the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,It's super fun.
Tammy 1,"Well You and Ron have a big meeting, huh?"
Tammy 1,I'm sure Ron will remember the meeting fondly while he makes toilet wine in a federal prison in Terre Haute.
Leslie Knope,I'll I'll head down to payroll.
Tammy 1,Now.
Tammy 1,You're not getting any younger.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."
April Ludgate,"She's the cold, distant mother I never had."
April Ludgate,I love her.
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, sir."
Leslie Knope,How can I help you?
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Your moustache fell off.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you goofball."
Ron Swanson,Tammy pointed out that my face looked better without any hair on it.
Ron Swanson,"And it did collect a lot of food crumbs, which is very unsanitary."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Jer."
Ron Swanson,"Hump day, am I right, buddy?"
Jerry Gergich,What?
Leslie Knope,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,Where's Tammy One?
Ron Swanson,She moved in with me.
Ron Swanson,She's really helping me out.
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, she converted my bank account into a joint bank account with her."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,And how is that gonna help?
Ron Swanson,Not sure.
Ron Swanson,"When she explains it, it makes total sense."
Ron Swanson,It is so nice having her around.
Ron Swanson,Here's something neat.
Ron Swanson,Tammy's got me taking baby aspirin to lower my risk of heart disease.
Ron Swanson,Science is a miracle.
Ron Swanson,"Anywho, back to the old grindstone."
Ron Swanson,These emails aren't gonna send themselves.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes can't be cured.
Chris Traeger,But it can be prevented.
Chris Traeger,Make a choice.
Chris Traeger,Make a change.
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger,What do you think?
Chris Traeger,Any notes?
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Just as good, if not exactly the same as the last one."
Chris Traeger,"In that last one, I left a nanosecond of a pause between the words, ""together"" and ""we."""
Chris Traeger,It felt much better.
Chris Traeger,But I'd love to try another one.
Ann Perkins,I really think we've got it.
Chris Traeger,Ann.
Chris Traeger,This is important to me because it's important to you.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, you spent a lot of time and energy on writing this."
Ann Perkins,Not really.
Chris Traeger,"So, it needs to be perfect."
Chris Traeger,"So, let's do 1 more, then 5 more, then 20 in a row."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, look who it is."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hey, hey."
Ben Wyatt,Tom.
Ben Wyatt,Jean-Ralphio.
Ben Wyatt,Professional basketball players.
Roy Hibbert,"'Sup, Jello shot."
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask you guys a question?
Ben Wyatt,How exactly are you making money?
Tom Haverford,Wanna know how we make money?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you wanna know how we make money?
Tom Haverford,By literally printing out our money.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We bought a printing press.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This prints bills with our faces and the e720 logo on them.
Tom Haverford,"And promote the company by going to clubs and tossing the bills in the air and screaming, ""Free money!"""
Ben Wyatt,You can't just print your own money.
Ben Wyatt,"This has to stop, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Aww!
Tom Haverford,"What's the deal, baby?"
Tom Haverford,"One second, you hit the party switch, and the next second, you're all business?"
Ben Wyatt,I need to see all of your books.
Tom Haverford,"You got it, baby."
Tom Haverford,Baby!
Tom Haverford,Get him the books.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Aww, Snapple."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Are we calling everybody ""baby"" now?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"'Cause honestly, I love that."
Tom Haverford,"Are we saying ""Snapple"" anytime we think something's dope?"
Tom Haverford,"'Cause I love that, baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I love?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hibbert, Hibbert."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hup, Jello shot!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Tom Haverford,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Extra,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"We're here to serve you, friend."
Ron Swanson,I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what is this memo you sent to me?"
Leslie Knope,You're not going to the battle royale?
Ron Swanson,I have decided not to attend this year.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all."
Leslie Knope,But you love arguing against government spending.
Leslie Knope,Why do you not wanna do it now?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,The government knows what it's doing.
Ron Swanson,I'm confident that I'll-- Ouchie.
Leslie Knope,You and I are going to lunch.
Leslie Knope,We have to talk.
Ron Swanson,Let me just call Tammy first and get permission.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, I was wondering if I could go to lunch with Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Ron Swanson,Bye.
Ron Swanson,She says I can't go.
Leslie Knope,You're going to lunch with me.
Leslie Knope,I say you can go.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, gosh."
Ron Swanson,I'm really in a pickle now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac."
Leslie Knope,But this?
Leslie Knope,Neutered wimp?
Leslie Knope,This is worse.
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Golden Dove"" is in trouble."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them."
Ron Swanson,"Just blurt them right out, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Anything you say will stay between you and me.
Ron Swanson,"Right, my love?"
Tammy 1,Stop fidgeting.
Ron Swanson,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
Tammy 1,He wants me here.
Tammy 1,He invited me.
Tammy 1,Nanananana.
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Tammy's totally cool.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I'll say it to her.
Leslie Knope,"You're evil, and you need to go."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you are a panic."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, may I use the restroom?"
Tammy 1,Remember to wash your hands.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,Let's cut the crap.
Leslie Knope,Is this audit even real?
Tammy 1,"In a sense, yes."
Tammy 1,"But in another, truer sense, no, it is not."
Tammy 1,"I want Ronald back, but I had to learn about his finances, to make sure my future was protected."
Tammy 1,I'm impressed.
Tammy 1,He's acquired quite a bit of gold.
Leslie Knope,You gold digger.
Leslie Knope,You're literally a gold digger.
Ron Swanson,The thing I love about Tammy is she calls me on my crap.
Ron Swanson,Every guy needs that.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, if you want this company to survive, you immediately need to downsize."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you don't need this airplane hangar"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"um, I think we do."
Ben Wyatt,"And two, you have to keep detailed financial records."
Roy Hibbert,Thank you!
Roy Hibbert,I've been trying to tell them that!
Detlef Schrempf,Waste of time.
Detlef Schrempf,They wouldn't know a nonemployee tax reportable expenditure request if it bit them in the ass.
Tom Haverford,"Hey guys, which two people here started their own company?"
Tom Haverford,'Cause I'm pretty sure it wasn't you two bozos.
Roy Hibbert,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you guys can swagger around all you want, but businesses need revenue, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Unless you start working on an actual plan, you're dead in a month."
Ben Wyatt,That's a fact.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, thanks for your time."
Tom Haverford,"But with all due respect, as far as business decisions go, I think we know what we're doing."
Tom Haverford,Don't forget to grab a free iPad on your way out.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,He didn't even have one.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Chris Traeger,Fight it!
Chris Traeger,"Not quite, but I like the energy are we still rolling?"
Ann Perkins,Yup.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's can we take a break?"
Chris Traeger,I think that's a great idea.
Chris Traeger,"I think we almost have it, and I am very excited at that prospect."
Chris Traeger,I'll cancel my four o'clock and my five o'clock and my six o'clock appointments.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe I dated him.
Ann Perkins,For a long time.
Ann Perkins,And he broke up with me!
Chris Traeger,Fat equals splat!
Chris Traeger,"As in, ""you're dead!"""
Chris Traeger,Is there something there?
Chris Traeger,No no.
Chris Traeger,That that sucked.
Chris Traeger,But there's something there.
Chris Traeger,I'm feeling it let's go right away!
Chris Traeger,It's magic time!
Chris Traeger,"From the top, everybody."
Ann Perkins,There's no one else here.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla."
Leslie Knope,"And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra."
Leslie Knope,No offense.
Tammy 2,None taken.
Tammy 2,I'm very flattered.
Tammy 2,Who's this?
Tammy 2,Who's this tall drink of water?
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Andy."
Tammy 2,How's it hanging?
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell."
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat?"
Tammy 2,"Well I could do all those things and have, but that bitch is crazy."
Tammy 2,"When Ron left her and we got together, she threw acid on my foot."
April Ludgate,Eww!
Andy Dwyer,Could we take a peek at it?
Tammy 2,"Listen, Tammy One was my Sunday school teacher, too."
Tammy 2,"She can pinpoint your weaknesses, and then destroy you with just one word."
Tammy 2,And a jar of acid.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I think I have an idea that could save Ron.
April Ludgate,"Andy, don't joke around."
Andy Dwyer,"I have ideas, too."
Ron's Mom,You were right to come get me.
Ron's Mom,My son Ronnie always had a weakness for those ladies.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Is this Ron?
Ron's Mom,Yup.
Ron's Mom,At the age of five.
Ron's Mom,He's standing next to the first chair he ever built.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God! There's a room full of just guns."
Leslie Knope,Why do you have so many guns?
Ron's Mom,"This is America, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ron's Mom,Then I don't have to answer stupid questions while standing on my own property.
Ron's Mom,Let's go.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, it's definitely Ron's mom."
Ron's Mom,Tammy?
Tammy 1,Tammy.
Ron's Mom,Ronnie.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Soaring Falcon"" is in its final stages."
Ron's Mom,It's time to settle this.
Tammy 1,Ah.
Tammy 1,An old-fashioned prairie drink-off.
April Ludgate,What's in that jug? It smells like jet fuel.
Ron Swanson,That's Swanson family mash liquor.
Ron Swanson,Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.
Ron Swanson,Its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats.
Ron's Mom,"If you win, he's all yours."
Ron's Mom,"And if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? That wasn't the deal."
Tammy 1,Pour it.
Tammy 1,I'm thirsty.
Leslie Knope,"Pour me one, too, then."
Leslie Knope,Let me in here.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no, don't drink that."
Ron Swanson,We use it to burn warts off of the mules!
Leslie Knope,Poison! Ugh! I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake.
Ann Perkins,How were we together for five months?
Extra,"Well, you know, it's possible you can just date a guy because of where you are in your life emotionally."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I suppose you're right, John."
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, I hate to say this, but I have a stain on my shirt."
Chris Traeger,"Which means that everything we shot so far is unusable, but let's use this as an opportunity to revisit the script."
Chris Traeger,Delivery guy.
Extra,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Ron's Mom,Had enough?
Tammy 1,Of this watered-down baby formula? Not even close.
Leslie Knope,Not meven clarse.
Leslie Knope,Marvin clods.
Leslie Knope,Glenn Close.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you don't have to do this"
Leslie Knope,"Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy."
Leslie Knope,Wrah! I can't feel my face.
Leslie Knope,My face is numb.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger,That's it.
Chris Traeger,I think we got it.
Chris Traeger,Do you think we got it?
Ann Perkins,"Yes! Yeah, we have it."
Ann Perkins,We had it seven hours ago.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Ann, I I know that I can be intense, but I'm only trying to be the best me that I can be."
Chris Traeger,"I want to thank you for this opportunity and your patience, and your intelligence, and your insight."
Chris Traeger,You really are an amazing human being.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, right-- that's why I dated him."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I wanted to apologize.
Tom Haverford,We brought in five accountants to look at e720 and they all said the same thing you did.
Tom Haverford,"If we don't start making changes, we're gonna lose the company."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, first thing you need to do: Get rid of four of those accountants."
Ben Wyatt,You don't need five accountants.
Tom Haverford,"Again, good advice."
Tom Haverford,Here.
Ben Wyatt,You really you need to stop giving these away like candy.
Tom Haverford,I bought that one personally.
Tom Haverford,As a thank-you.
Tom Haverford,It's an iPad.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody prance, now! prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance"
Ron Swanson,She's had enough.
Ron Swanson,Call it off.
Tammy 1,That's not how it works.
Tammy 1,She's out.
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,I'm subbing in.
Ron Swanson,"April, no--that stuff will melt the shell off a garden snail."
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,I'm Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,I can handle it.
April Ludgate,"oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson,This ends now.
Leslie Knope,Ah.
Ron Swanson,"Mom, you're going back to the farm."
Ron Swanson,"And you, you're going back to hell."
Tammy 1,Fine.
Tammy 1,I got what I came for anyway.
Tammy 1,I found your underground safe.
Tammy 1,I stole half your gold.
Ron Swanson,That's decoy gold.
Ron Swanson,"You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it? You don't know me at all."
Tammy 1,"Yes, I do."
Tammy 1,I knew you the minute you were born.
Tammy 1,And I intend to be there the minute you die.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family's weird."
Ben Wyatt,"Literally, there's someone reading a magazine, and someone applying nail Polish."
Ben Wyatt,What's that what is she doing? She's just playing with an iPad.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom told me that chair was 27,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,That chair that has a roof.
Ben Wyatt,there's someone over there in a deep sleep.
Ben Wyatt,"She's probably being paid upwards of 100,000 dollars a year."
Ben Wyatt,There's this video of a boat.
Ben Wyatt,Look at that thing.
Ben Wyatt,What is that? What are you supposed to do with that thing?
