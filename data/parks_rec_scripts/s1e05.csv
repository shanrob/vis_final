Leslie Knope,"In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre."
Leslie Knope,"This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark."
Leslie Knope,"He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis."
Leslie Knope,They cut his face off.
Leslie Knope,And they made it into a dream catcher.
Leslie Knope,And they made his legs into rain sticks.
Leslie Knope,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer."
Leslie Knope,Today is a great day for the Knope family.
Leslie Knope,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.
Leslie Knope,"The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, is a great man."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I saw you survive that town hall meeting.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is."
Leslie Knope,"But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes."
Leslie Knope,Minus the drinking problem.
Leslie Knope,I mean no disrespect.
Ron Swanson,The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.
Ron Swanson,That woman is tough.
Ron Swanson,"In 1994, I gave her a nickname."
Ron Swanson,"It's unrepeatable, but it stuck."
Ron Swanson,It's my proudest accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,"It's ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,This is a big night.
Leslie Knope,"We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down."
Tom Haverford,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mother.
Leslie Knope,How important are speeches?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it didn't answer your call?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.
Leslie Knope,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.
Leslie Knope,Read that part back to me.
Tom Haverford,"""I was learning disabled and my mom cast a very long shadow."""
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't say ""learning disabled."""
Tom Haverford,"Um, we'll just move on."
Tom Haverford,We can fix that later.
Tom Haverford,"Long shadow, go."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I've lost my momentum now."
Leslie Knope,"Um, all right, let's start from the top."
Leslie Knope,What's the first sentence again?
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope is morbidly obese."""
Leslie Knope,"I never said ""obese."""
Leslie Knope,"I said ""is my mother."""
Tom Haverford,"Oh, sorry."
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Leslie Knope,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to sound braggy.
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Tom Haverford,"It's about appearing humble, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"Abraham Lincoln, when he started his speeches, he would come up and say, ""My name's Abraham Lincoln."""
Tom Haverford,"""I'm the President of the United States."""
Tom Haverford,"""But I'm gonna be honest with you."""
Tom Haverford,"""I have no clue what I'm doing."""
Tom Haverford,"So, maybe you start off with something like that."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, I start off with, ""I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing."""
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Then, I think what we want to do at that point is start getting the energy up."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,How about this?
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope is definitely not a whore."""
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has not five but seven Asian friends."""
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has never solicited a male prostitute."""
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has said the N word only four times in her entire life."""
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Tom Haverford,She said it more than that?
Ann Perkins,How about this one?
Andy Dwyer,That is hot.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That is really hot.
Andy Dwyer,How come you don't dress up like that for me?
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to ""the couch."""
Ann Perkins,I haven't been out in so long.
Ann Perkins,Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.
Ann Perkins,"I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm out of milk."
Ann Perkins,"How dressy is this, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,To the max.
Leslie Knope,It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Um, I should probably change."
Leslie Knope,I'm headed to the salon right now.
Leslie Knope,Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.
Leslie Knope,All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does."
Salvatore,Next.
Leslie Knope,"So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?"
Salvatore,My feet hurt.
Leslie Knope,Classic Salvatore!
Salvatore,Do I know you?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, no."
Leslie Knope,This is my first official political haircut.
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation."
Salvatore,Are you related to that Marlene Something Knope?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,Would you call being her daughter related?
Salvatore,What the hell else would you call it?
Salvatore,"Now, what do you want me to do with this?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, my mom is being honored tonight."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a way, I am also being honored."
Leslie Knope,"And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
April Ludgate,"Good evening, sir."
Leslie Knope,"I'm off the clock, April."
Leslie Knope,You don't need to call me sir.
Leslie Knope,"Salvatore calls this hairdo ""The Mayor."""
Leslie Knope,"And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, I am way overdressed."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,We look great.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's looking at us.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,You want a drink?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, I do very much want a drink."
Ann Perkins,That man is staring.
Leslie Knope,That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Rarified air!
Ann Perkins,He's coming over.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Be cool, be cool!"
Ann Perkins,I will try.
Frank Schnable,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former City Councilman."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.
Frank Schnable,I just wanted to tell you that I think that what you two are doing is so brave.
Frank Schnable,Just being who you are.
Frank Schnable,I wish I had your courage.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go."
Ron Swanson,I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steeltoe boot.
Ron Swanson,But this hotel always serves bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ron Swanson,That's my number one favorite food wrapped around my number three favorite food.
Ron Swanson,"I'd go to a banquet and honor of those Somali pirates, if they served bacon wrapped shrimp."
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Table 12."
Leslie Knope,"Can I get a ""what what?"""
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, Ann, you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow."
Leslie Knope,I was going for wow.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Ann Perkins,I was told it was black tie.
Ron Swanson,"I like your hairdo, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It's just like my brother's.
Ron Swanson,He's an officer in the Air Force.
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, I'm okay."
Ron Swanson,I wasn't offering.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, don't look."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I said don't look."
Leslie Knope,Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what a night!"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,This is so cool.
Leslie Knope,At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.
Leslie Knope,"Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.
Leslie Knope,"That's his disappointing son, Theo."
Leslie Knope,Another dynasty.
Leslie Knope,What a testament to my mother.
Leslie Knope,"If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then just go up there and say hello and start talking to her."
Leslie Knope,"Brilliant political strategy, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're overthinking this.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, be you."
Mark Brendanawicz,Go.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope from the Parks-- What are you doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I can do whatever I want.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park."
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you?
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wait, what's that?"
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I'm just former City Councilman Frank Whatever The Hell.
Ann Perkins,"And I have more power than Janine Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know if that's true or not.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope and I will destroy you all!"
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you guys doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's fun to pretend to be zoning board members.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hey My goodness.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Look at you.
Leslie Knope,You like?
Leslie Knope,I went to Salvatore.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Salvatore usually does men.
Leslie Knope,Usually.
Leslie Knope,But this time he made an exception.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann Perkins.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, right, Leslie's new friend."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, friend."
Ann Perkins,She's We're friends.
Ann Perkins,Just friends.
Ann Perkins,I have a boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,He's a man.
Leslie Knope,"So, I need your advice."
Leslie Knope,I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The queen of the zoning board?
Ann Perkins,Am I the only [bleep] Person here who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?
Leslie Knope,I think she could be very useful.
Leslie Knope,What's my in?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, let's see."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You wrote a speech?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's 22 minutes long, with the song."
Leslie Knope,I could cut the song.
Leslie Knope,The song's cut.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Scrap the whole thing.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Let's make the speech work for us.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, politics!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,My mom is crazy good at this.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, the two things you have going for you is your connection with me, of course, and the fact that Restrepo loves feeling important."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So make sure that you butter her up.
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter."
Leslie Knope,"Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom, but she's so much more than that."
Leslie Knope,She's also my mother.
Leslie Knope,"And together, we are the Knopes."
Leslie Knope,"And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, ""political dynasty."""
Leslie Knope,Please save your applause until the end.
Leslie Knope,There are so many luminaries here tonight.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others."
Leslie Knope,"In conclusion, my mom is Marlene Griggs-Knope."
Leslie Knope,And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"And you, too, Janine."
Tom Haverford,"You're the man, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I wish I could talk.
Leslie Knope,Moving and shaking.
Ann Perkins,This is my evening.
Ann Perkins,I'm Leslie's trophy wife.
Extra,I'd like to invite anyone who has a few words to say to Marlene to come up during dinner.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Pawnee government!"
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"And if five years ago, you told me I was gonna be in this ballroom with Marlene Griggs-Knope, I would've guessed we were getting married."
Leslie Knope,Janine?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Janine Restrepo,Hi.
Janine Restrepo,Have we ever met?
Leslie Knope,"No, but I am a big fan."
Leslie Knope,I'm Marlene's daughter.
Janine Restrepo,"Yeah, I got that."
Leslie Knope,"Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city."
Janine Restrepo,"Okay, well, call my secretary, and maybe we can set something up for next month."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Janine Restrepo,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Janine Restrepo,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Next month, then."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Janine Restrepo,Uh-huh.
Janine Restrepo,Bye.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I can't leave now."
Ann Perkins,I'll get one for you on the way home.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, meatball and ham."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is that two different subs?"
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,I don't know if they can do that.
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Tom Haverford,I'm serious!
Tom Haverford,"Now, the words ""too sexy"" aren't really in my vocabulary, but, Marlene, girl, you are too sexy!"
Ron Swanson,"I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else."
Ron Swanson,Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts.
Ron Swanson,Marlene is a woman.
Ron Swanson,She has worked in the government for three decades.
Ron Swanson,Thirty years.
Ron Swanson,"Properly applied, that's how long a good varnish should last."
Ron Swanson,"So, Marlene, it is true that you have won this award."
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz.
Tom Haverford,Let's bounce.
Tom Haverford,We're gonna be late.
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Tom Haverford,Ladies.
Tom Haverford,Scully's Bar.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Bounce, bounce, bounce."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Please, you guys are the only people here I know."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, well, this thing's kind of wrapping up."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe we could leave a little later.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, it's 9:30, on a Friday night in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,"There's not gonna be a later, Mark."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, now, you promised we'd go hit on chicks."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you and Leslie can join us at the bar.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I would love to come hit on chicks with you guys, but she seems kind of engaged in something and I think I should probably stay."
Tom Haverford,You'd hit on chicks?
Tom Haverford,For real?
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, you know what?"
Mark Brendanawicz,We're gonna be at Scully's if you two can tear yourselves away.
Tom Haverford,"Let's do this, Mark."
Leslie Knope,It went really well with Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Did she say call her or call her secretary?
Leslie Knope,Secretary.
Leslie Knope,"That's good, right?"
Leslie Knope,Secretary makes her schedule.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That's great, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's blowing us off.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Really?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, she's totally blowing us off."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's a little weasel.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And she's trying to keep it quiet.
Leslie Knope,"Well, everyone has their problems."
Leslie Knope,"So, what should my next tactic be?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"The DUl, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town."
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could do that.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day."
Leslie Knope,They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Those are eight of the nastiest, most diabolical people you could ever want to meet."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Bert Winfield was a blackmailer.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And Dawn Krink slept her way to the top of the DMV.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Trip Holloway named names in the '50s.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Horace Rangel used the police department to harass journalists.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And Jesus, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Tony Tellenson was the worst.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He tried to resegregate the drinking fountains.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, where's Mark?"
Ann Perkins,He left with Tom.
Leslie Knope,Shoot!
Leslie Knope,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it."
Ann Perkins,I could help.
Ann Perkins,Give me something to do.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.
Leslie Knope,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom vroom vroom vroom and glug glug glug glug glug.
Ann Perkins,So you're gonna blackmail her?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson style."
Ann Perkins,"That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy."
Ann Perkins,It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you don't understand politics."
Leslie Knope,"Look, nursing is easy."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them."
Leslie Knope,"But politics is different, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to bring the pain.
Leslie Knope,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.
Ann Perkins,I think your mom's giving you bad advice.
Leslie Knope,I don't think so.
Ann Perkins,You just do everything your mom tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,Make any pancakes lately?
Ann Perkins,He has two broken legs.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches."
Leslie Knope,And one of them is you!
Leslie Knope,And the other two are crutches.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I don't need to be here."
Frank Schnable,It's okay.
Frank Schnable,You're allowed to fight.
Frank Schnable,You two are just like everyone else.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable."
Extra,"And now, a very special message from Mr. Anthony Tellenson himself, recorded earlier this year from his hospital bed, before he lost the power of speech."
Ann Perkins,"I'm leaving now, honey."
Ann Perkins,"Cool Ranch, got it."
Ann Perkins,Anything else?
Ann Perkins,Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers."
Tom Haverford,I've been dying to go out with Mark.
Tom Haverford,Always thought we'd make a great team.
Tom Haverford,You know?
Tom Haverford,"He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie."
Tom Haverford,He's laid back.
Tom Haverford,"I'm more in your face, but in a fun way."
Tom Haverford,Ladies don't stand a chance.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh What's with the hat?
Tom Haverford,It's called peacocking.
Tom Haverford,"Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock."
Tom Haverford,"So, the girls will be like, ""Hey, what's with that hat?"" I'm gonna go peacock it out."
Tom Haverford,I'll be back.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Extra,"Thank you, Tony, for those inspiring twitches and blinks."
Leslie Knope,I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.
Leslie Knope,How about Monday?
Janine Restrepo,Call my secretary and we'll set it up.
Leslie Knope,Not good enough.
Janine Restrepo,Not good enough?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,I know about things.
Janine Restrepo,"Well, my schedule is my schedule."
Janine Restrepo,"So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert."
Leslie Knope,Drive much?
Janine Restrepo,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Your husband.
Leslie Knope,Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver.
Leslie Knope,My mom told me.
Janine Restrepo,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Uh Just saying.
Janine Restrepo,Get out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Janine Restrepo,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what came over me.
Janine Restrepo,Leave.
Leslie Knope,I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.
Tom Haverford,"Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents."
Tom Haverford,That must be fun.
Extra,Uh-huh.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Any cool stories you got, huh?"
Extra,Um What do you mean?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses?"
Extra,"Um One time, I forgot my keys to one of the houses."
Extra,"Whoa! Oh, my God, you do that, too?"
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,I've done that.
Extra,That's the worst.
Extra,"Then you have to drive all the way back, and then you have to be like, ""I forgot my keys."""
Extra,"And then they're like, ""You did that twice."""
Tom Haverford,Look at these guys! The key-forgetting twins!
Tom Haverford,I'll be right back.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Can I settle, please?"
Tom Haverford,Dude.
Tom Haverford,What is your problem?
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Tom Haverford,"Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them."
Tom Haverford,And that's making them lose interest in me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Becky and Stacy are boring.
Tom Haverford,"I need you back there, man."
Tom Haverford,"I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right?"
Tom Haverford,"If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards."
Tom Haverford,You're the king.
Tom Haverford,You're my hero.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm gonna get out of here."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'll see you Monday, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman."
Leslie Knope,"I tried, but I just couldn't do it."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,That's a good thing.
Ann Perkins,It wasn't you.
Ann Perkins,"You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa! Hey! What the hell? Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were a dude.
Leslie Knope,The people who win awards aren't always the best people.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due."
Leslie Knope,Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.
Leslie Knope,"But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy."
Leslie Knope,"He lives in Florida, in a cemetery."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, my mom is alive and I love her."
Leslie Knope,She's one tough cookie.
Leslie Knope,"That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,Fondly.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I'm married."
Tom Haverford,But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies.
Tom Haverford,The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us.
Tom Haverford,You like the color orange? Carrots? You into those?
