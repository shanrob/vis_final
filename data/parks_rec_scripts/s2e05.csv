Leslie Knope,"Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,Our photo-op with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP."
Tom Haverford,"I told you, gold sequin sweatpants."
Leslie Knope,"Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country."
Leslie Knope,These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am a little nervous."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.
Leslie Knope,But things have changed.
Leslie Knope,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,What if they don't speak English?
Leslie Knope,"April, you know Spanish, right?"
April Ludgate,Tu entierres en tu trabajo porque tu eres enfeliz en tu vida personal.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
April Ludgate,My mom's Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, clean up."
Leslie Knope,Pull your thing up.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, just be Good."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, hit it."
Leslie Knope,This is my baby.
Leslie Knope,"I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something."
Leslie Knope,"It's not been easy, you know?"
Leslie Knope,How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48 hour visit?
Leslie Knope,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.
Leslie Knope,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,"I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad Hoc Subcommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope."
Raul,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Raul,"I'm Vice Director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departamento de Parques, Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Maldonado."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Raul,"These are my colleagues, Antonio Rivera-Fonseca, Minister of Small Fountains."
Raul,"And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges."
Leslie Knope,And he is?
Raul,Pay no attention to him.
Raul,"He is our intern, Johnny."
Raul,He is worthless.
Raul,We are quite tired from our trip.
Raul,"Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?"
Tom Haverford,What'd he call me?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, please."
Leslie Knope,"It's a different culture, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just be a good host.
Leslie Knope,Do this for me?
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.
Leslie Knope,"Go, boy!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor."
Raul,Excellent.
Raul,I like to party.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my job is to see to your every need."
Antonio,Do we just select the woman we desire?
Antonio,I will take the large black one.
Tom Haverford,Interesting choice.
Leslie Knope,What?
Raul,Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?
Raul,"If not, I will also take the sexy black one."
Donna Meagle,I am not surprised at all.
Donna Meagle,I've been to South America.
Donna Meagle,I did very well there.
Leslie Knope,I think there might've been a translation problem.
Leslie Knope,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay."
Leslie Knope,"But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing."
Raul,"So, no women?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Off to kind of a weird start.
Leslie Knope,We have so much to learn from each other.
Leslie Knope,What kind of birds do you guys eat?
Raul,Chickens.
Leslie Knope,"Us, too!"
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Raul,What is this?
Leslie Knope,"Water, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Agua.
Raul,"In our country, government officials drink only bottled water."
Leslie Knope,I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.
Raul,No.
Raul,"Bottled, please."
Raul,Send the boy.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get water."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come on!"
Raul,For your troubles.
Tom Haverford,"You got it, Chief."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, can you help me out a second--"
April Ludgate,"Go away, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Raul,This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.
Raul,It is a gift.
Leslie Knope,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.
Leslie Knope,A key aspect to diplomacy is gift giving.
Leslie Knope,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it needs to represent the local culture."
Leslie Knope,And I found the perfect thing.
Leslie Knope,"A bottle of high fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory."
Leslie Knope,Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,Since 1891.
Leslie Knope,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing."
Raul,Yes.
Raul,And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.
Raul,"We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage."
Leslie Knope,"His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being."
Raul,"We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea."
Raul,Their town is far nicer.
Leslie Knope,"That's fine, it's my job."
Leslie Knope,I'm a diplomat.
Leslie Knope,I'm not supposed to take it personally.
Raul,"We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing."
Raul,"Really, really sad stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her."
Leslie Knope,"She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world."
Raul,"It's funny because Antonio said to me, ""Can we turn this car around and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way?"""
Raul,"Of course, that would be rude to you."
Elvis,What is your profession?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a city planner.
Elvis,This city was planned?
Elvis,"On the drive in, I saw a tattoo parlor, next to a school next to a Taco Bell."
Elvis,It looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent.
Ann Perkins,He's actually a pretty smart rodent.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uhoh!
Elvis,Ah!
Elvis,You have a quick wit.
Elvis,You know what?
Elvis,"I've changed my mind, I will have you for the evening."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Boy.
Mark Brendanawicz,She'll get back to you on that.
Ron Swanson,"Politically, no, I don't support Chavez."
Ron Swanson,I despise him and everything that he does.
Ron Swanson,"On the other hand, this is a pretty sweet-ass gun."
Tom Haverford,"The banana you wanted, senor."
Raul,Ah!
Raul,Finally.
Raul,You peel.
Tom Haverford,What?
Raul,"With your hands, you peel the banana."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Let's get started, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,I have a full day of activities planned.
Elvis,I would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners.
Leslie Knope,A restaurant?
Raul,American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.
Raul,"I mean, they're like little basketballs."
Raul,"I mean, they're huge, little porkers."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is our thermometer!
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.
Leslie Knope,"But I need 35,000 dollars, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget."
Raul,I do not understand.
Leslie Knope,You've never had a budget shortage?
Elvis,No.
Raul,Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.
Raul,"Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Raul,"The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, well."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I do not understand."
Raul,I feel my English was very clear.
Raul,Shall I repeat?
Raul,"Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil."
Raul,Oil is food for cars.
Leslie Knope,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be."
Tom Haverford,You said they might not know what toilet paper is.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling an audible.
Leslie Knope,We can't be humble anymore.
Leslie Knope,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, we'll go further."
Leslie Knope,We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Or New York.
Leslie Knope,Or London!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait, the money's different there."
Leslie Knope,They'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,We'll go to the park.
Leslie Knope,Everybody doing okay back there?
Leslie Knope,Comfortable?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice."
Leslie Knope,You can watch TBS.
Leslie Knope,Do you have TBS in Venezuela?
Raul,I have everything in Venezuela.
Raul,I have four satellite dishes on my estate.
Raul,"We get 14,000 channels."
Raul,Fourteen thousand.
Raul,I already know who wins Project Runway.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming over to your house then.
Raul,"I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you."
Raul,I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,"Take it in, boys."
Raul,This is an embarrassment to America.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Raul,You are right to want to correct this.
Leslie Knope,Correct what?
Raul,"This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?"
Raul,The one you want to turn into a park?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,This is already a park.
Leslie Knope,And it's one of our best loved parks.
Elvis,Why are the trees so small?
Leslie Knope,They're not that small.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, size doesn't matter."
Raul,"Yes, it does."
Raul,Our trees are huge.
Raul,We build tunnels through them.
Raul,The parks in Boraqua are far superior.
Raul,"The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater."
Raul,It's huge.
Elvis,Lady Gaga played there last week.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga."
Leslie Knope,And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.
Leslie Knope,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.
Leslie Knope,Democracy.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna show you an example of that.
Leslie Knope,Let's go to a town hall meeting.
Tom Haverford,"Elvis, Oh Henry!"
Tom Haverford,"Raul, Butterfinger."
Tom Haverford,"Antonio, Nestle Crunch with the crispy rice removed."
Tom Haverford,"Weird choice, but for you, I got it done."
Raul,Gracias senor.
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,I find it incredibly demeaning.
Tom Haverford,But guess what?
Tom Haverford,Cash money.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna make it rain. I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready?"
Leslie Knope,We're about to start.
Raul,This is where you have your meetings?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the location rotates."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.
Leslie Knope,Where do you hold your meetings?
Raul,"Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,We don't need palaces.
Leslie Knope,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.
Mel,What are you?
Mel,Some kind of moron?
Mel,Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?
Mel,They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!
Mel,Anyone knows that!
Gretel,My dog went to one of your parks and ate another dog's feces.
Gretel,And I'm going to sue you for that.
Lawrence,How do you like it?
Leslie Knope,No!
Lawrence,How do you like that?
Lawrence,Now imagine you're holding coffee.
Raul,This is outrageous.
Raul,Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?
Raul,Where are they?
Raul,This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.
Raul,"You shout like that, they put you in jail."
Raul,Right away.
Raul,"No trial, no nothing."
Raul,Journalists?
Raul,We have a special jail for journalists.
Raul,You're stealing?
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,You're playing music too loud?
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,Right away.
Raul,You're driving too fast?
Raul,Jail.
Raul,Slow?
Raul,Jail.
Raul,"You're charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses, you right to jail."
Raul,"You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail."
Raul,"You overcook chicken, also jail."
Raul,"Undercook, overcook."
Raul,You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?
Raul,"Believe it or not, jail, right away."
Raul,"We have the best patients in the world, because of jail."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was tough going, but it was lively."
Leslie Knope,What did you think of the open forum?
Elvis,This meeting of ugly people yelling?
Elvis,It is like torture.
Leslie Knope,That's one perspective.
Raul,"In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter."
Raul,"Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?"
Raul,Are you kidding me?
Raul,We're like kings!
Raul,We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.
Raul,We answer to nobody.
Leslie Knope,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable."
Lawrence,Hey!
Lawrence,These pretzels suck!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,See?
Raul,No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets done?
Leslie Knope,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Leslie Knope,Or American Idol.
Leslie Knope,Or the moon!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there."
Raul,"Look, this is not personal."
Raul,We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.
Leslie Knope,I think you're rude.
Leslie Knope,And I think you've been rude since you came here.
Leslie Knope,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!"
Raul,Hey!
Raul,Do not disrespect Chavez.
Leslie Knope,Stupid Chavez.
Raul,I just told you not to disrespect him.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I just did."
Raul,That's twice.
Leslie Knope,I don't like Chavez.
Raul,"Yes, you do."
Raul,And do not disrespect him.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Raul,"Yes, you do!"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't, Raul."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?"
Raul,Great.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Raul,"We're shutting up, yeah."
Raul,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Those are our pens.
Raul,Right.
Raul,We don't even need them.
Leslie Knope,"Great, then don't take them."
Raul,We didn't.
Leslie Knope,They started it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't do that!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Then call the Venezuelans and apologize.
Leslie Knope,"No, they were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks!"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Then I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,Do you see the problem here?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill."
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,Can I get anyone anything to drink before we start?
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Tom Haverford,Brandy?
Leslie Knope,I'd love some coffee.
Tom Haverford,"Anything, guys?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Some nuts?
Leslie Knope,I'll have some nuts.
Tom Haverford,Gummi Bears?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Apple crisps?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Granola bars?
Leslie Knope,I'll take those.
Tom Haverford,Nothing?
Tom Haverford,Sure?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I'll be right out there if you need me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday."
Leslie Knope,It was completely uncalled for.
Raul,"Well, we are sorry as well."
Raul,We were very tired from our long journey.
Elvis,"Also, we were a bit jealous."
Elvis,Our colleagues from Caracas are visiting their sister city of Miami.
Raul,Yeah.
Raul,They've been partying with Dwyane Wade.
Raul,They sent us all these photos and QuickTime files.
Raul,"I mean, you have to see this place Miami."
Raul,"Just gorgeous, everything."
Raul,"There's so much soul and life everywhere! Every little tiny street, so much culture, and history! And the cars! People really take care of their cars there."
Raul,"You notice that and they're a little older, but still just beautiful."
Elvis,Clean and shiny
Raul,"Really, really nice."
Elvis,Yeah.
Raul,"And the food, so spicy and wonderful."
Raul,We could not even believe it.
Raul,But Pawnee is really good as well.
Elvis,Yes.
Raul,"In any case, I made a few phone calls, and the government of Venezuela has authorized a special gift for you."
Leslie Knope,"35,000 dollars?"
Raul,"Yes, it is to fill your pit to start to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we can't take this."
Raul,"Yes, yes, yes."
Raul,Please.
Raul,We will see you later today at the photo opportunity.
Raul,And I think we're good here.
Raul,No? Okay.
Raul,"Okay, gracias."
Raul,Good meeting.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should return the money.
Leslie Knope,"It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna return the money.
Tom Haverford,Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.
Ann Perkins,"Or, you could build a park with that money."
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the pros and cons.
Ann Perkins,"Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park."
Leslie Knope,"Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money."
Tom Haverford,"Pro, 35,000 dollars worth of dirty money."
Leslie Knope,"Con, not quite sure why that's a pro."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Pro, we can fill in the pit."
Leslie Knope,"Con, Ann already said that."
Leslie Knope,Pro and con never works!
Tom Haverford,"Pro, yes it does."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,We'll keep the money.
Leslie Knope,"Okay? Everybody happy? Jerry, are you happy?"
Jerry Gergich,What did I do?
Leslie Knope,"Meeting adjourned, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Look, I know they've given you a hard time."
Ron Swanson,"When the mayor gets here, we'll do the photo-op, they'll be out of our hair, you'll get to build your park."
Raul,Ah! Leslie! Hello.
Leslie Knope,Raul.
Leslie Knope,The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.
Raul,"If you don't mind, we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sure."
Raul,Do you have the check that we gave to you?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yes, I do."
Raul,"Okay, you're gonna show it to the camera and say how much it is and what it is for."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is a check for 35,000 dollars and it is to build a park."
Raul,How generous!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's really generous."
Raul,"Now say ""Viva Venezuela!"""
Leslie Knope,Viva Venezuela!
Raul,Viva Chavez!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Venezuela!"
Raul,"""Viva Chavez!"" Say it!"
Leslie Knope,"Aw, come on."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to ""viva"" that guy."
Raul,"We just gave you 35,000 dollars."
Raul,"That's worth one ""viva."""
Leslie Knope,Viva Chavez.
Raul,Yes! Viva Chavez!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What is he saying?
April Ludgate,They are very happy.
April Ludgate,They say Hugo Chavez will love this video because it is another success for their committee.
Leslie Knope,Committee?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America.
Raul,It will be a good video.
Leslie Knope,The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?
Raul,Yes.
Raul,It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.
Raul,And we just had an idea.
Raul,"Why don't you call the park after Chavez? You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park."
Raul,"And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time."
Raul,You should write this down.
Leslie Knope,Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!
Raul,You have offended us.
Raul,You have offended the government of Boraqua.
Raul,You are no longer our sister.
Leslie Knope,"No, America is not perfect."
Leslie Knope,But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you got to get tough.
Leslie Knope,"I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.
Leslie Knope,Unless that's what the people want.
Leslie Knope,"And that, sir, is democracy."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come see this!"
Tom Haverford,Check out this video April sent me.
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,I'm at Johnny's place in Venezuela.
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I guess."
April Ludgate,He has like five million rooms.
April Ludgate,And this is only his guesthouse.
Leslie Knope,Holy cow!
April Ludgate,There's a lot of guys with guns here.
April Ludgate,"It's better than my mom's house, I guess."
April Ludgate,"So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back."
April Ludgate,"Oh, and Donna's here."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, guys! Hola!"
