Tom Haverford,"Hi, there."
Ron Swanson,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,Puppy!
April Ludgate,A puppy is here!
Leslie Knope,Can we keep him?
Andy Dwyer,My neighbor's dog had a litter.
Andy Dwyer,They're looking for people to adopt.
April Ludgate,I love him.
Andy Dwyer,I wish he had tiny puppy shoes.
Andy Dwyer,I would totally shine his little shoes for free.
Andy Dwyer,I do say the cutest stuff.
Ron Swanson,"Look, I love a good dog as much as the next guy, but this building doesn't allow animals."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, take him outside."
Andy Dwyer,"What, and shoot him?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Just keep him outside.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I'm just a little puppy.
Tom Haverford,I ain't done nothing wrong.
Tom Haverford,I'm just a puppy.
Tom Haverford,I like your mustache.
Tom Haverford,I wish I could have one.
Tom Haverford,But I can't.
Tom Haverford,Because I'm just a little puppy.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, take him out and shoot him."
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Where?
Leslie Knope,In my belly.
Leslie Knope,Because the 24 hour Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon starts tonight.
Ron Swanson,Goody.
Ron Swanson,Let us know how it went.
Leslie Knope,"Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research."
Leslie Knope,"And it's important, because Pawnee is the fourth fattest town in the U.S."
Leslie Knope,"It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of The Mall of America."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this year, I get to program my own four hour block."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Exciting!
Leslie Knope,"So, I have signed you all up for multiple shifts."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to answer phones and provide moral support."
Tom Haverford,From when to when?
Leslie Knope,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,From 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, please."
Jerry Gergich,Tonight's kind of a big night.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, all my kids are away, andâ¦"
Tom Haverford,Gross!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,It's Jerry's sex night.
Tom Haverford,That ruins sex and tonight.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you put on one of these Tshirts?
Leslie Knope,It will get you in the mood.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night last night making these.
Tom Haverford,You stayed up all night the night before an all night telethon.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,And here's why.
Leslie Knope,Boom.
Tom Haverford,"""Diabetes."""
Tom Haverford,"""Let's Dia-beat-this."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to come up with the slogan.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to embroider them.
Tom Haverford,Time well spent.
Leslie Knope,Salad sucks.
Leslie Knope,There.
Leslie Knope,I said it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Feel better?
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Mark Brendanawicz,I've been doing some thinking.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not going to ask Ann to move in with me.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Is something wrong?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Mark Brendanawicz,I love her.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I want a partner.
Leslie Knope,Horseback.
Leslie Knope,You should ask her on horseback.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"She should be on the hot air balloon, and you should ride up on horseback."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"She's in the balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky, up there, skywriting, ""Marry me, Ann."""
Mark Brendanawicz,I think I can figure out the right way to ask her.
Leslie Knope,How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you think I should do it, though."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Definitely.
Leslie Knope,Can you get five eagles?
Leslie Knope,"No, get ten eagles."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're right."
Leslie Knope,It's your life.
Leslie Knope,Get as many eagles as you want.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, you're in for tonight, right?"
Tom Haverford,I forgot to tell you.
Tom Haverford,"I can't make it to the telethon tonight, because I have no interest in being there."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're in charge of the VIP special telethon guest.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to believe who I got.
Leslie Knope,People are going to freak out.
Tom Haverford,Rihanna.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Dr. Oz.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to guess.
Tom Haverford,Justin Bieber.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ex- lndiana Pacers small forward, Detlef Schrempf."
Tom Haverford,The Detlef Schrempf?
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really exciting."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Leslie Knope,And I need you to be his bodyman.
Leslie Knope,Pick him up at the airport at 7:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, just entertain him."
Leslie Knope,Because he doesn't need to be in hair and makeup until 2:00 a.m.
Tom Haverford,Does Pawnee Cable Access even have hair and makeup?
Leslie Knope,"Well, they have a communal lipstick and a box of combs."
Ann Perkins,"As a nurse and as your friend, I highly suggest you don't try to stay up for the next 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,I can definitely do it.
Leslie Knope,I've already been up for 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,But I have a secret weapon.
Ann Perkins,NutriYum bars?
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,They're terrible.
Leslie Knope,But they give me an insane 15 minute burst.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, my nana used to tell me, ""You'll sleep when you're dead."""
Leslie Knope,"My nana, she used to say the best stuff."
Leslie Knope,"""Don't work yourself into a lather."""
Leslie Knope,"""Look where it is and you'll find it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Don't put me in a home."""
Leslie Knope,"""Tell the truth and shame the devil."""
Leslie Knope,"""The devil knows where you're hiding."""
Leslie Knope,"""If you take enough rides with the devil, pretty soon, he's going to drive."""
Leslie Knope,She was really into the devil.
Leslie Knope,I have not checked in with you lately.
Leslie Knope,I'm randomly and casually asking.
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Mark?
Ann Perkins,Things are good.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the one?
Ann Perkins,The one?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Ron Swanson,I'm here.
Ron Swanson,What do I have to do?
Leslie Knope,I have you on phone answering duty from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.
Ron Swanson,That's horrible.
Ron Swanson,I have to nap up.
Ron Swanson,"If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition."
Tom Haverford,Got enough leg room back there?
Detlef Schrempf,Yeah.
Detlef Schrempf,"Yeah, you don't have to sit so far up."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I do."
Tom Haverford,"So, Detlef Schrempf."
Tom Haverford,"Three time NBA All-Star, two time Sixth Man Award winner."
Tom Haverford,It must have been pretty cool to be traded to the Pacers in exchange for veteran center Herb Williams.
Detlef Schrempf,"So, you looked me up on Wikipedia, huh?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Everybody knows that.
Tom Haverford,Just like everybody knows you appeared in two episodes of the German soap opera Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten.
Detlef Schrempf,"What, you a big fan of that show?"
Tom Haverford,Huge fan.
Detlef Schrempf,Huh?
Detlef Schrempf,"Oh, 6'10""."
Tom Haverford,"I'm 5'6"" and three quarters."
Leslie Knope,"All right, team, you guys psyched?"
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, all you need to do is take down everybody's name and address and ask them how much they want to donate."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, do these phones dial out?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Donna Meagle,No reason.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you know what?"
Jerry Gergich,My phone has 25 lines.
Jerry Gergich,I think it might be a switchboard.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, then."
Leslie Knope,You got the most lines.
Leslie Knope,"Figure it out, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"Come on, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Everyone else has one line.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh!
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Leslie, I hear you're going to be in front of the camera this year."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's exciting.
Joan Callamezzo,Cut the chatter.

Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,"Tonight, we're hoping the people of Pawnee dig their big, chubby hands into their plus-size pockets and donate generously."
Martin Housely,"Weird, wacky stuff."
Joan Callamezzo,Stop it.
Martin Housely,"Coming up, a very special video presentation called Even My Tongue is Fat: The Story of Pawnee."
Martin Housely,"But right now, to begin with, let's start things off in our telethon with a song."

Mark Brendanawicz,"So, that's why you pulled your pants down."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what did I do?"
Perd Hapley,It's 6:04 a.m. and I'm Perd Hapley of Channel 4 Eyewitness News.
