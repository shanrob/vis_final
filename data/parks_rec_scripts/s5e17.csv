Extra,I'm looking for Ronald Ulysses Swanson?
Ron Swanson,He stepped out.
Ron Swanson,Can I take a message?
Extra,Sure.
Extra,Tell him he just won a free dinner from St. Elmo's steak house.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron Swanson!
Extra,You've been served.
Extra,Have a nice day.
Ron Swanson,I don't like you.
Ron Swanson,But I respect the effort.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man, subpoena?"
Tom Haverford,"Which exwife is it, Tammy one or Tammy two?"
Ron Swanson,Neither.
Ron Swanson,Apparently councilman Jeremy Jamm is not pleased that I punched him in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.
Ron Swanson,He's suing me.
Ron Swanson,"13,000 for orthodontic surgery, 6,000 for enamel repair, and 46 million for psychological damages."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that seems about accurate."
April Ludgate,That guy is the worst.
April Ludgate,We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turdburger.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, hey, let me be your lawyer."
Andy Dwyer,"I'll object to everything anyone says, trial will go on forever, you don't have to pay."
Andy Dwyer,Problem solved.
Ron Swanson,"That's a kind offer, Andrew, but I won't be hiring an attorney."
Ron Swanson,"I'll represent myself, as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions."
April Ludgate,I wish we had 46 million dollars.
April Ludgate,We could buy my parents' house and evict them.
Tom Haverford,Surprised he's taking it this well.
Ron Swanson,Aghh!
Ron Swanson,"April, could you call maintenance please?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and freeze."
Leslie Knope,"That is the exact spot where an 18 year old Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you very much."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, congratulations to you."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I have chills.
Ben Wyatt,Can't believe they're finally giving me the key to the city.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it took so long.
Leslie Knope,"They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do."
Ben Wyatt,And none of them caused the city's unemployment rate to hit 30%.
Leslie Knope,You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.
Leslie Knope,"When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called ""Ice Town,"" and they went bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,"Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Town hero!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, if it isn't the defendant, Ron Swansuck."
Tom Haverford,"Why are you doing this, Jamm?"
Tom Haverford,This lawsuit is Chronicles of Riddickulous.
Jeremy Jamm,I'll tell you why.
Jeremy Jamm,It's 'cause I'm sick of this whole Parks and Rec gang.
Jeremy Jamm,That's why.
Jeremy Jamm,This munch throws me into a swimming pool.
Jeremy Jamm,"The nurse still won't have sex with me, and she's not even queer."
Jeremy Jamm,Now Swansuck punches me in the mouth.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's what we in the Jamm family call ""Payback time."""
Tom Haverford,Everyone calls it that.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, because I invented it."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're not gonna win $50 million, you freak."
Jeremy Jamm,"Maybe not, but I'm not not going to win nothing."
Jeremy Jamm,Paul.
April Ludgate,That guy is a joke.
April Ludgate,This lawsuit is definitely getting thrown out.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, those are JeanRalphio's lawyers."
Tom Haverford,"They once got him 60,000 dollars 'cause he got too scared at a haunted house."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, are you done?"
Chris Traeger,Are we done?
Chris Traeger,Did we win?
Ann Perkins,You can't win this.
Ann Perkins,You can win at anything.
Chris Traeger,Last year I won an organic gardening contest.
Donna Meagle,Who were you competing against?
Chris Traeger,My own taste buds.
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and Chris has agreed to be the father."
Ann Perkins,My fertility counselor showed me this online quiz that determines whether we'd be compatible parents.
Ann Perkins,"If this were the '80s, all we'd have to do is, like, not drop an egg for a whole day."
Ann Perkins,Stupid Internet.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, our official coparenting score is 58% compatibility. Not amazing."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I think it's fantastic."
Chris Traeger,I think it's literally the best score we could have hoped for.
Ann Perkins,Not sure that that's true.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, snap!"
Donna Meagle,I just filled it out for fun.
Donna Meagle,Chris and I are 81% compatible.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna make a baby, traeger?"
Donna Meagle,"Your hair, my everything else."
Donna Meagle,That kid would be unstoppable.
Jerry Gergich,"Guys, I couldn't resist."
Jerry Gergich,I did it too.
Jerry Gergich,Ann and I got 84%.
Ann Perkins,"Well, this sucks."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we did not win."
Leslie Knope,"So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?"
Leslie Knope,Did he make you watch star war movies?
Stephanie Wyatt,Make me?
Stephanie Wyatt,I loved those movies just as much as he did.
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Oh, you do a lot of hugging."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, get used to it."
Leslie Knope,We're sisters now.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Benji, I'm really glad you came back for this."
Stephanie Wyatt,A lot of jerks around here didn't think you'd show up.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wasn't sure, but Leslie gave me the extra push, and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice town thing behind me once and for all."
Leslie Knope,"Now that you're both here, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,Just have a few questions.
Stephanie Wyatt,You have a binder?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?"
Ben Wyatt,Um What's that?
Extra,And what exactly did you witness?
Andy Dwyer,"Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias my boss, used appropriate force to prevent further damage to the wedding of Leslie Knope, alias my other boss."
Extra,You sound as if you have a special interest in law enforcement.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"In fact, at the time, I was trying to become a police officer but was deemed unfit for the force."
Extra,And what happened?
Andy Dwyer,Don't know.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I pooched the brain exam."
Andy Dwyer,"Just to be safe, I wouldn't take anything I say too seriously."
Andy Dwyer,"Next witness, your honor."
Extra,"Ms. Ludgate, have you ever heard Mr. Swanson threaten to hurt councilman Jamm?"
April Ludgate,Ronny?
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,I've never heard him threaten to hurt anyone or anything.
April Ludgate,"The guy's, like, a vegetarian."
April Ludgate,"Look at him, he's like a big, old, soft teddy bear."
April Ludgate,"His nickname around the office is ""SoftyPants McHuggable."""
Extra,Did you ever hear Mr. Swanson say he intended to injure councilman Jamm before the day of the wedding?
Tom Haverford,"The answer is a flat ""no."""
Tom Haverford,Ron doesn't really pay much attention to other people.
Tom Haverford,I doubt he even knew you existed.
Tom Haverford,"Also, may I say for the record, that is a dope pocket square."
Tom Haverford,Can I see that bad boy?
Ron Swanson,Tom and April were excellent witnesses in my defense.
Ron Swanson,"Unfortunately, every single word out of their mouths was a lie."
Ron Swanson,There's only one thing I hate more than lying.
Ron Swanson,Skim milk.
Ron Swanson,Which is water that's lying about being milk.
Ben Wyatt,"Despite everything that happened 20 years ago, this will always be my hometown."
Ben Wyatt,Are you crying again?
Leslie Knope,"It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation."
Stephanie Wyatt,"Wow, I didn't think about all that, but I thought it was good."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Steph."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, I'm feeling sweaty."
Ben Wyatt,"Do I look sweat I feel oh, I need to use the bathroom one more time."
Stephanie Wyatt,"That's, like, five times in an hour."
Leslie Knope,"Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony."
Stephanie Wyatt,I don't blame him.
Stephanie Wyatt,He didn't exactly leave Partridge as the most popular guy in town.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm giving birth.
Ben Wyatt,Is that possible?
Ben Wyatt,"No, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Stephanie Wyatt,I'll call an ambulance.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,It's twins!
Ben Wyatt,I'm having twins!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Kidney stone?
Extra,Big sucker too.
Extra,We're gonna have to keep him here until it passes.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and Dr. Clipperton Wow, man, I'm so glad you guys are meeting."
Ben Wyatt,It's like worlds collide.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I love it."
Ben Wyatt,I want candy.
Ben Wyatt,What is he on?
Extra,Morphine.
Extra,It's good stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, come here."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Ben Wyatt,You're like a flower.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, no, like a snugbug or like a snuggerdoodle or something like that."
Ben Wyatt,"We should just go for it, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,Life.
Leslie Knope,We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.
Leslie Knope,Is there anything that we can do?
Extra,"Sorry, Ice Town, you're not going anywhere for at least a day."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this town expects me to wuss out."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm making that speech, and I'm simply gonna explain to the crowd that love is everywhere and they have to surrender to the flow of the universe, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,"Price Is Right is on, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you remember staying home sick from school watching the price is right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Look, I know that this is just a silly quiz, but it is so discouraging to do so poorly."
Ann Perkins,"Well, look, this is not the only way to see if we would be good parents."
Ann Perkins,"I know it's a little lame, but I bought a dozen eggs at the grocery store, and I thought we could do that thing where we pretend the egg is a kid for a day."
Chris Traeger,That's a great idea!
Ann Perkins,I don't see them.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I left them at the grocery store.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,"I bought 12 babies, and then I immediately abandoned them at a Kroger's."
Chris Traeger,"Look, we can use anything as a baby."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, we could use this mug."
Tom Haverford,I don't understand.
Tom Haverford,I was great.
Tom Haverford,"I was like Mark Z in The Social ""N."""
Tom Haverford,My testimony was amazing for your case.
Ron Swanson,But it wasn't the truth.
Ron Swanson,And neither was yours.
Ron Swanson,You even called me a vegetarian.
Ron Swanson,What if that testimony leaks?
Ron Swanson,How will people ever respect me?
April Ludgate,"Ugh, whatever."
April Ludgate,The truth is stupid.
April Ludgate,I only tell the truth when it makes me sound like I'm lying.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, lying is all I know."
Tom Haverford,"It's how I was able to scrape by on the streets of Bombay and make it on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and get reunited with the love of my life, Latika."
Ron Swanson,You could both take a lesson from Andrew.
Ron Swanson,"He told the truth about everything he was asked, even when it was humiliating for him."
Andy Dwyer,That's right.
Andy Dwyer,I love telling the truth.
Andy Dwyer,"Case in point, sometimes when I blow my nose, I get a boner."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,It just happens.
Andy Dwyer,Truth bomb.
Ron Swanson,"I'm gonna call you both back in that room, and you'll recant your testimony."
April Ludgate,No!
Ron Swanson,You committed perjury.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, you've dishonored yourselves."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, brother."
Andy Dwyer,They are so young.
Andy Dwyer,So much to learn.
Ron Swanson,What are you talking about?
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Wisdom.
Mayor Stice,Sick?
Mayor Stice,Do you really expect me to believe that?
Mayor Stice,"What has he got, acute wimping out?"
Stephanie Wyatt,"No, he has kidney stones."
Stephanie Wyatt,We have proof.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I never gave miles Davis proper shrift.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, I just didn't get into it."
Leslie Knope,But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.
Mayor Stice,"Boy, it's just a real shame it had to happen today of all days."
Mayor Stice,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,You want me to come back to the hospital?
Ben Wyatt,"Pfft, nah."
Ben Wyatt,I'm goodie goodie.
Ben Wyatt,"You just do your thing, baby smurf."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish you were here."
Leslie Knope,It seems pretty fun and festive.
Leslie Knope,Town mascot is here.
Ben Wyatt,Fred the Sled?
Ben Wyatt,They only bring him out for special occasions.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe they're doing all this for me.
Ben Wyatt,The universe is love.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stay away from sharp things."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well, heard you want to recant your earlier statements."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I misremembered some things."
Tom Haverford,I did in fact hear Ron Swanson say he intended to injure Jeremy Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boom, knew it."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tell us about it, please."
Tom Haverford,Which time?
Extra,"Well, how many were there?"
Tom Haverford,Well
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, we did a trade."
Jeremy Jamm,"I gave his wife new enamels, he gave my wife new yabbos."
Ron Swanson,Who's that gentleman?
Tom Haverford,"Jeremy Jamm, city councilman."
Tom Haverford,You don't know him?
Ron Swanson,Never met him.
Ron Swanson,He looks like he could use a swift punch in the face though.
Jeremy Jamm,Yes!
Tom Haverford,"And then before he can say anything, I just run over, shove him into the pool."
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,"If it were me, I would have just punched him in the face."
Tom Haverford,"What's up, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Just daydreaming about punching Jamm in the face.
Tom Haverford,And there were a few other times too.
Ron Swanson,"We get the picture, son."
Jeremy Jamm,Hold on.
Jeremy Jamm,"We need your full, truthful testimony on record."
Jeremy Jamm,"Keep going, Tom."
Mayor Stice,"But now, 20 years later, the city has finally healed from the festering wound of Ice Town."
Mayor Stice,"Today we put those horribly painful memories behind us as we welcome back the mayor who made all of that possible, Ben Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a typo."
Leslie Knope,That's a major typo.
Leslie Knope,"That says ""Ice Clown."""
Leslie Knope,I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.
Extra,"Hey, aren't you his sister?"
Stephanie Wyatt,I gotta get outta here.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Good luck, Leslie."
Mayor Stice,"Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr. Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,And it's water.
Mayor Stice,"Uhoh, the key was made of ice."
Mayor Stice,"And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away."
Mayor Stice,"Again, this would all be way more satisfying if Ben was here."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way."
Leslie Knope,"And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago."
Leslie Knope,But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Be able to forgive him.
Mayor Stice,"If it's so meaningful to him, then where is he?"
Leslie Knope,"He's in the hospital, sir."
Leslie Knope,He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town."
Extra,"Oh, yeah?"
Extra,What about Judy Garland?
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's from Partridge?
Extra,She lived here for a while.
Extra,And Lee Janzen.
Leslie Knope,Who's Lee Janzen?
Extra,He's a golfer.
Extra,He's pretty good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland."
Leslie Knope,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw you, Partridge."
Leslie Knope,And a sled is a stupid mascot.
Extra,"Thank you, Ms. Ludgate."
Extra,"It is now quite clear that on innumerable occasions Ron Swanson said he intended to punch councilman Jamm in the face, and then he did."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but who cares?"
April Ludgate,He says a lot of things.
April Ludgate,"He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners."
Extra,"Mr. Swanson, if you'd like to make a statement, you may."
Ron Swanson,"On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off."
Ron Swanson,"And instead, he attacked me twice."
Ron Swanson,"Truthfully, I barely registered his attack."
Ron Swanson,"He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak."
Ron Swanson,"And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground."
Ron Swanson,I regret nothing.
Ron Swanson,The end.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined."
Jeremy Jamm,You got Jammed by your own team.
Jeremy Jamm,Self Jamm!
Jeremy Jamm,"I'll see you in court, Swanson, and, uh, bring your checkbook."
Ron Swanson,I would like to punch you in the face again.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, Paul, let's go."
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're feeling better.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, get your normal conversation in with me while you can."
Ben Wyatt,Got about 20 minutes before I get all loopy again.
Ben Wyatt,"Mm, let me see the key."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, they took it back."
Leslie Knope,They wanted to get it engraved.
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the key is just a metaphor."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the real key has been inside you all along."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a setup, wasn't it?"
Ben Wyatt,They were gonna make fun of me?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town was a debacle.
Ben Wyatt,They'll never get over it.
Ben Wyatt,Just don't know why I got my hopes up.
Leslie Knope,It's so unfair.
Leslie Knope,You worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You've done so many great things.
Leslie Knope,"And for your hometown to treat you this way is just You know what, screw this."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.
Leslie Knope,Tuck in your shirt.
Leslie Knope,We're going to city hall.
Ann Perkins,"So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took the compatibility test that you recommended, and we didn't do amazing."
Ann Perkins,"But I'm sure that happens with a lot of couples, right?"
Chris Traeger,And it's not like we failed.
Chris Traeger,"We got a 58%, which as I'm saying it, sounds very clearly like we failed."
Extra,"Look, there are many ways to judge compatibility."
Extra,"Okay, you know what, let's do a little exercise."
Extra,"I'm gonna say something about your future child, and then you just say the first thing that pops into your mind."
Extra,Okay?
Extra,Gender.
Ann Perkins,Girl.
Chris Traeger,Boy.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Religion.
Chris Traeger,Buddhist.
Ann Perkins,Whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Whatever he wants.
Extra,"Um, how 'bout occupation?"
Ann Perkins,Teacher.
Chris Traeger,Sixtime tour de France champion.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Extra,"Okay, I'm sorry, are you guys complete strangers?"
Extra,Is this one of those craigslist father situations?
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no."
Chris Traeger,We actually know each other quite well.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we used to date actually, but it didn't work out because we had some compatibility issues."
Extra,"You know what, why don't we just try one more compatibility test?"
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it!"
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, we all told the truth, and Jamm's definitely going to win."
Tom Haverford,What do we do now?
Ron Swanson,I intend to do as the court orders.
Ron Swanson,Do you know if one can pay court-ordered settlements in gold? All of my money's in gold.
Ron Swanson,I also have some money in palladium.
Tom Haverford,What if it's a huge amount? Are you gonna be okay financially?
Ron Swanson,I think so.
Ron Swanson,I'm actually not sure how much money I have.
Ron Swanson,But I do know how many pounds of money I have.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, whoa, that is awesome."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is, and I'm definitely tweeting that to Drake to use in his next rhymes, but still I kinda feel like this is our fault."
April Ludgate,"Ugh, do we have to do something nice now?"
Leslie Knope,"Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice."
Leslie Knope,I had no right to disparage your town.
Mayor Stice,"Well, I owe you guys an apology too."
Mayor Stice,"I, uh, had a little bad publicity lately, and frankly, it's still really easy to score points by bashing Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame?"
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, babe."
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Mayor Stice,"You know, if people found out I gave Wyatt the key to the city, I would never get re-elected."
Mayor Stice,So no.
Mayor Stice,"What are you doing there, Wyatt?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm feeding your eagle.
Ben Wyatt,He's starving.
Leslie Knope,"It's it's bronze, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Leslie Knope,The eagle-- We should go.
Mayor Stice,#NAME?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I know it didn't seem to go very well at the counselor's.
Chris Traeger,"But I have found a new quiz, and I think we should take it."
Ann Perkins,Are you sure? Everything we do makes it seem like it's a bad idea for us to have a kid together.
Ann Perkins,Maybe we shouldn't even be friends.
Chris Traeger,Take a look.
Ann Perkins,"""Will you love our child and work hard to see that he or she has a good life?"""
Chris Traeger,"You see, I think that's the only question that matters."
Chris Traeger,All the rest of it is details.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,The answer is yes.
Chris Traeger,I said the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger,We're 100% on the same page.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure about this?
Chris Traeger,"You are caring, intelligent, and reliable."
Chris Traeger,And I am certain that you will literally be the world's best mom.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,This is really happening.
Ann Perkins,"You know there's nothing in there yet, right?"
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sorry."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, I was with Johnny Cougar Mellencamp at that music fest."
Jeremy Jamm,"We both thought, biggest yabbos we've ever seen in-- What the hell? That was important."
April Ludgate,"Game's over, councilman."
April Ludgate,Drop the suit.
Jeremy Jamm,And why exactly would I do that?
Tom Haverford,We took a look at your affidavit.
Tom Haverford,"We cross-referenced it with telephone records and eyewitness accounts, and, uh-oh, we found 11 lies."
Andy Dwyer,"Lying under oath is called perjury, and they should know, they did it yesterday."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I mean, maybe I accidentally said something that wasn't-- Let me see that."
Tom Haverford,"Ow! My wrist! You twisted my arm like a maniac! - Oh, no! -"
April Ludgate,You monster.
Tom Haverford,"Ow! You assaulted me, and I'm injured!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, I see what you're doing."
Jeremy Jamm,I barely touched you.
April Ludgate,That's not what I saw.
Tom Haverford,My face! Is my face still there? What happened to my knees?
Andy Dwyer,Someone please tell me if Tom is okay.
Tom Haverford,"- Jamm, I'm gonna sue you."
Jeremy Jamm,#NAME?
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, listen, keep your mouths shut about the affidavit, I'll drop the suit, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Hurry, Tom, let's get you into surgery!"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it's me."
Jeremy Jamm,We got Jammed.
Ben Wyatt,My friend Jack and I used to fish this lake in the summer.
Ben Wyatt,"One time, our boat almost tipped over, but then it didn't."
Leslie Knope,That's not a great story.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I had a pretty uneventful childhood."
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,Where did you get that?
Leslie Knope,I stole it from mayor Stice's office.
Leslie Knope,Screw that guy.
Leslie Knope,You should have it.
Ben Wyatt,You're the best wife in the world.
Ben Wyatt,But I don't want this.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge, but I have Pawnee now."
Ben Wyatt,And I have you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know what then?"
Extra,"Hey, lake's not a garbage can, pal."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic."
Extra,"Is that Ben Wyatt? Get the hell out of here, Ice Town!"
Leslie Knope,Run! Run!
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
