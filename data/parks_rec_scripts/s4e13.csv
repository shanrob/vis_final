Character,Line
Leslie Knope,I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business related development.
Leslie Knope,Together we will build a better pawnee.
Tom Haverford,So what we're looking for here are your overall impressions of this candidate.
Tom Haverford,What do you like about her?
Tom Haverford,What don't you like about her?
Tom Haverford,"Her ideas, her voice, her clothes probably."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group."
Leslie Knope,Some things are very helpful.
Leslie Knope,Other things are not so helpful.
Leslie Knope,All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
Extra,"She's kinda short, don't you think?"
Extra,Aggressively short almost.
Extra,It's like she's throwing it in my face.
Tom Haverford,Insightful.
Donna Meagle,"You, sir, said you would not vote for her, correct?"
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"Yeah, she seems a little uptight."
Derek,"She doesn't seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with, you know?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I am excellent at bowling.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I know it's tough to hear these things, but just try not to get obsessed over one comment."
Leslie Knope,You're totally right.
Leslie Knope,I'm not obsessing.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Extra,"I actually thought that she was smart, and I'd vote for her."
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Extra,"Although I once knew a Leslie, and, uh, she was just awful."
Extra,So now I hate all Leslies.
Extra,Would she consider changing her name?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go."
Ben Wyatt,71% said you have a strong command of the issues.
Ben Wyatt,"That is good, but only 33% said that they would consider voting for you."
Leslie Knope,"Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff."
Leslie Knope,Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me?
Ben Wyatt,You really have to let that go.
Leslie Knope,I've never been very good at letting things go.
Leslie Knope,I can't tell you how many times a fun tugofwar with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
Leslie Knope,One of us always ends up mad.
Leslie Knope,"I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
Leslie Knope,"His average is 132, according to the most recent available data."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling"
Leslie Knope,which I am.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Ben Wyatt,Which we all know you are.
Ben Wyatt,But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.
Leslie Knope,That is so sexist.
Leslie Knope,It's just because I'm a woman.
Leslie Knope,"Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about."
Ben Wyatt,"See, a lot of people don't vote with their brains."
Ben Wyatt,They vote with their guts.
Ben Wyatt,"I know you're fun, and you can have a good time."
Ben Wyatt,The public needs to see that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,It would be laidback.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone having fun, great photo op."
Ben Wyatt,That could actually work.
Leslie Knope,Also I'm really good at bowling.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I don't think I believe you."
Ben Wyatt,Is there anyone I can ask?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding.
Jerry Gergich,"All right, it is time for the 12th Leslie Knope Fundraising Phone Bank."
Jerry Gergich,Is everybody feeling good?
April Ludgate,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house."
April Ludgate,My life couldn't be worse.
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Let's get this phone party started.
April Ludgate,No.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry I'm late, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"I know this kind of thing can be a grind, but Ben said that this is the most important thing we can do to help Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,So tonight is going to be fun.
Jerry Gergich,"You're probably thinking, how could it possibly be fun?"
Chris Traeger,No one's thinking that.
Andy Dwyer,I kinda was.
Chris Traeger,I was not.
Andy Dwyer,Why are we laughing?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, tonight we are gonna spice things up with a little competition."
Jerry Gergich,Whoever raises the most money by the end of the night will win two free movie passes to the pawnee monoplex.
April Ludgate,You really think that's gonna motivate people
Chris Traeger,"oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I could use that for a romantic night with Millicent Gergich.
Chris Traeger,"Out of my way, suckers."
Chris Traeger,"As city manager, I play no favorites."
Chris Traeger,"But as a private citizen, I am free to support whomever I choose, and I choose to support team Knope because they're the best."
Chris Traeger,Everybody's the best.
Chris Traeger,We're all winners.
Leslie Knope,Do I look laidback?
Ann Perkins,You look like you're trying to look laidback.
Leslie Knope,How about now?
Ann Perkins,I think just maybe just stand how you would normally stand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I forget now.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks for coming, man."
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,This bowling alley has my favorite restaurant in pawnee.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,You're not scared to eat here?
Ron Swanson,"When I eat, it is the food that is scared."
Ron Swanson,Why are you sitting weird?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Who's ready to bowl so hard?
Tom Haverford,Tommy's new bowling swag.
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"When you do it, you really do it."
Ann Perkins,"Good for you, man."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Leslie Knope, who is running for city council."
Chris Traeger,Is this Deirdre Splatterfork?
Chris Traeger,That is literally the most beautiful name I have ever heard.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't think we can accept donations over 50 dollars."
Jerry Gergich,"I don't really know why you would need my social security number, but well, yeah, no."
Jerry Gergich,You're right.
Jerry Gergich,I guess it couldn't hurt to give it to you.
Jerry Gergich,It's 2 1 0
Donna Meagle,absolutely nothing.
Donna Meagle,What are you wearing?
April Ludgate,"Fine, if you don't wanna donate, then don't."
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way I'm calling from inside your house."
Chris Traeger,Ha ha!
Chris Traeger,100 dollars.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa.
Chris Traeger,This is unbelievable.
Chris Traeger,I cannot be stopped.
April Ludgate,"I don't care about that prize, but I'm gonna win because I want his happiness to go away."
Tom Haverford,"Type in ""T Rex"" for me."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no."
Tom Haverford,"Um, ""t boss"""
Tom Haverford,""" Wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,"""Tommy Tsunami."
Tom Haverford,""" No, ""ticky ticky Tom Tom."
Tom Haverford,""" No, ""fly guy."
Ron Swanson,""" I wrote ""tom."
Tom Haverford,""" Classic."
Tom Haverford,Timeless.
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Ann Perkins,"""Girl""?"
Extra,"I saw your ad from when you were a kid, but it's nice to have a beer and get to know you."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thanks, rich."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here."
Leslie Knope,Smile.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this is going really well."
Ben Wyatt,Pretty decent turnout.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, is that the guy from the from the focus group?"
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I think it is.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, sir, would you mind telling me how you heard about the event tonight?"
Derek,"Oh, uh, I got a weird invitation in the mail."
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize we were sending out invitations.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're that girl from the focus group thing I did."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Ben Wyatt,Can I talk to you for a sec?
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Straight down the middle.
Ron Swanson,"No hook, no spin, no fuss."
Ron Swanson,Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, big girl."
Tom Haverford,Let's knock these little pins down.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
Ron Swanson,"Son, people can see you."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,That right there Tommy's strike.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, what happened to the big picture?"
Leslie Knope,I'm thinking about the big picture.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
Leslie Knope,"I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling."
Ben Wyatt,"We need everyone here to see a different side of Leslie Knope, not one specific person."
Ben Wyatt,Some people just aren't gonna like you.
Ben Wyatt,Let it go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hear you."
Leslie Knope,I'll treat him just like everybody else.
Leslie Knope,"I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook."
Leslie Knope,"And by the end of the night, he will be mine."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, ""thar"" she bowls."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl?
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl together?
Leslie Knope,"You wanna be, like, bowl buddies?"
Derek,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Great, just a casual game, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No biggie.
Derek,You okay?
Derek,"My sister has scoliosis, and I think you might, you know"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just I'm just being cas."
Leslie Knope,What are you rocking?
Leslie Knope,A 15 pounder?
Derek,16
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, hey, good for you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there they are."
Leslie Knope,I just ordered some wings for us.
Leslie Knope,You like wings?
Derek,Love them.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Who knew?
Leslie Knope,I knew.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Derek,Why are you mad?
Derek,You bowled a strike.
Leslie Knope,"That's how I motivate myself, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Never good enough.
Leslie Knope,Let me get you a beer.
Derek,Cool.
Leslie Knope,These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
Derek,You watch Ice Road Truckers?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, dude."
Leslie Knope,It's my guilty pleasure.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep]?
April Ludgate,"Hello, is this Mrs."
April Ludgate,Gallivan?
April Ludgate,"Well, my name is April, and wouldn't you know it, I'm raising money for a city council candidate I believe in."
April Ludgate,"No, mira, mira, mira, mira, mira."
April Ludgate,"It's, like, whatever you want."
April Ludgate,"Like, 10 dollars."
April Ludgate,It don't matter.
April Ludgate,"Well, I reckon it's just like grammy Martha told me and my cousins, ""you can't eat the biscuits if you don't pay for the flour."
Chris Traeger,""" Put the phone down, take a deep breath, and then you are going to tell Steven that you will be treated with respect, okay?"
Chris Traeger,And thank you for your donation.
April Ludgate,"Well, gee, I don't know, Fred."
April Ludgate,"All I know is that I just want to live in a world that's a better place, and your contribution will definitely help us get there, to the Better place world, Fred."
Leslie Knope,Yeehaw!
Leslie Knope,"Man, move over, pins."
Leslie Knope,There's a new Sheriff in town.
Leslie Knope,"You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae."
Derek,Who's that?
Leslie Knope,It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, you're really good at this."
Derek,It's your turn.
Derek,Try not to break a nail.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, classic Derek with the Zings."
Leslie Knope,"Man, that's what bowling is all about hey."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Leslie Knope,It's going really good.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,"Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I just wanted to remind you that when you're bowling, try not to fixate on just one pin."
Ben Wyatt,You're trying to knock down a lot of pins.
Leslie Knope,"I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Derek,"Hey, could you get me another one of these?"
Ben Wyatt,I I don't work here.
Leslie Knope,Classic Derek.
Chris Traeger,I am taking a probiotic tea break.
Chris Traeger,"And while that is happening, I thought I might share some big news."
Chris Traeger,I am going to ask Millicent Gergich to move in with me.
Chris Traeger,"I I mean, if that's okay with you of course, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,Of course.
Jerry Gergich,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, do you guys wanna live here with us and Ben and champion, the three legged dog?"
Chris Traeger,That is an amazing offer.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Chris Traeger,But I think we're probably gonna get our own place.
Chris Traeger,I'm already working with a Real Estate agent to find an octagonal house.
Chris Traeger,"I've done some reading, and an octagon is the optimal shape for a home in terms of energy flow."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, I hate to pull rank, but if you're going to take a break, would you mind going in the living room, just, you know, so it doesn't disturb everybody else."
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, I love it when you pull rank."
April Ludgate,You're being weird.
April Ludgate,Why?
Jerry Gergich,Milli's gonna break up with Chris.
Donna Meagle,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that's gonna super weird when they move in together."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I don't know when, but she is definitely gonna do it."
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Were you trying to get a seven?
Tom Haverford,"Because if you were, you did a great job."
Ron Swanson,I am very angry right now.
Ann Perkins,What?
Tom Haverford,My finger was in there.
Tom Haverford,Ron crushed my finger.
Tom Haverford,I think it might be broken.
Ann Perkins,Are you a female bird?
Ron Swanson,It was an accident.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, it's already swollen."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, my God, do you have any pride at all?"
Tom Haverford,You did this on purpose.
Tom Haverford,You're jealous of my gift.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, come on, Tweety Bird, let's get you some ice."
Tom Haverford,It hurts.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Well, congratulations, man."
Leslie Knope,"Fun match, fun game, good times."
Leslie Knope,Did you have fun?
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,I'm not one to complain about free beer and free bowling.
Derek,See you around.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote?"
Derek,No.
Leslie Knope,Derek.
Leslie Knope,You old soandso.
Leslie Knope,"For reals, can I count on your vote?"
Derek,"Yeah, no, um, I don't think so."
Leslie Knope,"But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun."
Leslie Knope,And you're still not gonna vote for me?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Derek,"I don't like you, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you."
Derek,"Yeah, right."
Derek,I destroyed you.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's true."
Leslie Knope,I am a really good bowler.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Derek,I don't know who Ron is.
Derek,"But if you're so great, let's play again."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'd love to.
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote."
Derek,"If I win, you clean my house for a month."
Leslie Knope,Done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, anyone else."
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Derek,Get me another beer.
Ben Wyatt,I don't work here.
Andy Dwyer,20 dollars?
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, we're really looking for donations more in the $10,000 range."
Millicent Gergich,"Hi, guys."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Just one second.
Chris Traeger,Let me get off this call.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger,I'm back.
Andy Dwyer,"What, champion?"
Andy Dwyer,You need to go outside now?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,That a boy.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, he's hates awkward situations."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Derek,Terrible moonwalk.
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Derek,"Yeah, what's up now, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you got a spare."
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,Check out the scoreboard.
Chris Traeger,"So Millicent and I are going to take a nice little stroll, and I'll be back soon."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, if you want to take the rest of the night off, you know, that would be fine."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't think that will be necessary."
Chris Traeger,Unless you also want to go get dinner.
Millicent Gergich,"Nope, this won't take too long."
Donna Meagle,"Chris, you might want to take a jacket with you."
Donna Meagle,It's about to get cold out there.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's company will keep me warm."
Donna Meagle,Take the jacket.
April Ludgate,I wished for his happiness to go away.
April Ludgate,I might be a wizard.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Derek."
Leslie Knope,"What a defeat, man."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I did not expect to win by that much."
Leslie Knope,"But I warned you, I am a good bowler."
Derek,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun."
Leslie Knope,And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Derek,"Yeah, I'll just write in ""bitch."""
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
Leslie Knope,Just ignore him.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Derek,I said she's a bitch.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Derek,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was awesome.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,Here's that photo op you wanted.
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,So you know that's everything that happens so it was just what happened.
Ben Wyatt,It was just like
Police Officer,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, I just I have a lot of adrenaline right now."
Leslie Knope,"Just take a few deep breaths, okay?"
Police Officer,The guy said he might press charges.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges."
Police Officer,"Yeah, that really wasn't an option."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, the guy was being a total jerk."
Leslie Knope,"What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way."
Leslie Knope,Did you write down how awesome it was?
Police Officer,"When we write official reports, we refrain from using words like ""jerk"" or ""awesome."
Ann Perkins,""" Hey, here you go."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, you and me, huh?"
Tom Haverford,"Hurt ""fingies."
Tom Haverford,""" No, no, two totally different injuries."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you just hang in there, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, love you too."
Jerry Gergich,Bye bye.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that was Milli."
Jerry Gergich,It happened.
Jerry Gergich,She broke up with Chris.
Donna Meagle,Boo.
Andy Dwyer,"Damn you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's not my fault.
Donna Meagle,"Well, I feel sorry for the man."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, the fundraising challenge is over, and the winner whoa."
Jerry Gergich,"We have a surprise winner, April."
Jerry Gergich,April wins two tickets to the pawnee monoplex.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That's my wife.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everything's settled here."
Ann Perkins,Wanna head home?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We haven't finished yet.
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, your turn."
Ann Perkins,He hurt his hand.
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, go."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I'll bowl one handed, like an idiot."
Ron Swanson,You need six pins to win.
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,King Kong ain't got nothing on me.
Tom Haverford,"Ow, my ""fingie"" still hurts."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, the bravery."
Ann Perkins,The perseverance.
Ann Perkins,You're an American hero.
Tom Haverford,"And the best part is, beautiful, you get to drive the champion home."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the headline I would've gone with is ""no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau."
Ben Wyatt,""" Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt,Let me resign.
Ben Wyatt,It's the only thing that truly protects you.
Leslie Knope,Nonstarter.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Now when you take questions, I think you should be brief and sincere."
Ben Wyatt,Don't try to justify what I did.
Ben Wyatt,"Just apologize again, and stay on script."
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure that you don't need more whipped cream?
Leslie Knope,Not today.
Leslie Knope,I don't deserve it.
Leslie Knope,I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
Leslie Knope,But this is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I do need more whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am.
April Ludgate,Hi.
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,How are you doing?
April Ludgate,"Uh, whatever."
April Ludgate,I'm fine.
April Ludgate,"Um, how are you?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, as you may know, Millicent Gergich ended our relationship last night, which was disappointing."
Chris Traeger,But here's why it may be the greatest thing that ever happened.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, good point."
April Ludgate,Hadn't thought about it that way.
April Ludgate,"Um, here."
April Ludgate,Take these tickets.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,you earned them.
April Ludgate,"They're movie tickets, Chris."
April Ludgate,"They're, like, 8 bucks."
April Ludgate,It's a gesture.
Chris Traeger,There are three of them.
Chris Traeger,I thought there were only two.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I know, I bought another one because I thought that maybe you, me, and Andy could go to the movies sometime."
April Ludgate,Just take the stupid tickets.
April Ludgate,I'm just trying to be nice.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
April Ludgate,There you go.
April Ludgate,"Okay, bye."
Extra,"Leslie, are you going to fire Ben Wyatt? Are you going to suspend your campaign?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope,"And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night."
Leslie Knope,"You know what? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sorry.
Leslie Knope,"This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive."
Leslie Knope,"And he was rude, and he was foulmouthed."
Leslie Knope,"And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him."
Leslie Knope,"I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome."
Leslie Knope,And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,But that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,"Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him."
Leslie Knope,"So what's the point, right, Derek?"
Derek,I feel like you're being kind of a bitch right now.
Leslie Knope,See? So I'm not going to apologize.
Leslie Knope,"And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it."
Leslie Knope,But you should be warned.
Leslie Knope,"If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up."
Leslie Knope,"Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, what are your overall impressions of this woman?"
Tom Haverford,What do you like about her?
Tom Haverford,What don't you like about her?
Extra,I like her.
Tom Haverford,#NAME?
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,"She's tough, I guess."
Extra,I just like her.
Extra,"I like that that one guy punched that other guy, and then I like that she stood by him."
Ben Wyatt,See? People vote with their gut.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings."
Leslie Knope,Go punch him.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Extra,Here you go.
Extra,Lane eight.
Ron Swanson,"No, Lane 22."
Ron Swanson,The one at the very end.
Ron Swanson,Son of a bitch.
Extra,"Hey, perfect game."
Extra,What's your name? Put it up on a wall.
Ron Swanson,"I was never here, and you will never speak of this again"
