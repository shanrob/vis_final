Leslie Knope,Is the coast clear?
Ann Perkins,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,My sneak around clothes.
Leslie Knope,Is he gone?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's gone."
Ann Perkins,Come in.
Ann Perkins,You gotta see this.
Ann Perkins,"Tom and I have been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I think I'm ready to say, ""I love you"" To his apartment."
Ann Perkins,I love you so much.
Ann Perkins,Look at all these blankets.
Ann Perkins,"One on the ottoman, one on the chair, one on the couch here, feel."
Leslie Knope,"Holy hell, that's soft."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, is that Yep!"
Ann Perkins,A whole shelf of coconut water.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm gonna cry.
Leslie Knope,This is like girl heaven.
Leslie Knope,Did he do all this just for you?
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,He just lives like this.
Ann Perkins,"He's deeply in debt, but you know what?"
Ann Perkins,Who cares!
Ann Perkins,'Cause check it out.
Ann Perkins,Cheese plate and Adriatic figs.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is always here."
Ann Perkins,I don't know when he has time to make it.
Ann Perkins,"Boutique eye cream, unisex cologne, lip exfoliator, chocolate covered almonds, and a Sudoku book just amenities everywhere!"
Leslie Knope,I love amenities.
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,It's the best part.
Ann Perkins,Night and day.
Leslie Knope,Look at this one.
Leslie Knope,There's another soft one.
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment?"
Extra,Make it quick.
Leslie Knope,In his seminal 2009 documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
Extra,Way quicker.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary."
Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen."
Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
Leslie Knope,"If you hear any of them talking about that ""blonde pain in the ass,"" that's me."
Extra,"Leslie, that budget is all but finalized."
Extra,I love building ships in bottles.
Extra,"When the ship is done, I put a cork in it, put it on the shelf, and I move on."
Leslie Knope,"Hold that cork, sir because I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts."
Leslie Knope,Meet Melody Sternway.
Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Leslie Knope,Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Extra,"Okay, you got me."
Extra,I'll find the cuts somewhere else.
April Ludgate,"Good morning, everyone!"
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.
April Ludgate,So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.
Extra,What exactly is the chain of command visavis onsite response?
April Ludgate,"You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?"
Extra,"Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge?"
April Ludgate,I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.
April Ludgate,She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.
April Ludgate,"I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,Just bouncing some business ideas off Russell Simmons on Twitter.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Extra,"All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you even know what you're doing here?"
April Ludgate,"All due respect, Mr."
April Ludgate,"hamster penis, but no, I don't."
Extra,My last name is Guiles.
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,Because you look like a hamster penis.
Tom Haverford,What about a cologne that can kill spiders?
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist."
Ron Swanson,"That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me."
Ron Swanson,I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.
Ron Swanson,"I mean, I have so many ideas."
Ron Swanson,"Some are simple like ""take down traffic lights"" and ""eliminate the Post Office."""
Ron Swanson,"The bigger ones will be tougher, like ""bring all of this crumbling to the ground."""
Chris Traeger,There is one more step in the vetting process.
Chris Traeger,"You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra."
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I'm interested in that.
Ron Swanson,"No, I am sure."
Ron Swanson,I am not interested in that.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds."
Chris Traeger,"It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together."
Chris Traeger,"Trust me, you'll love it."
Chris Traeger,I'll see you tomorrow.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wear your yoga pants."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first."
Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,That's the point.
Ben Wyatt,"You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate."
Ben Wyatt,You're in a campaign literally.
Ben Wyatt,Everything you do right now is politics.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Is this politics?
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,What is what is that?
Ben Wyatt,What why did you do that?
Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.
Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this might be a good thing."
Ben Wyatt,But there's a reason we strategize before we make decisions.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I'll make some calls, see where we are."
Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.
Ben Wyatt,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,I'm just really into you.
Leslie Knope,"Gimme a spin, baby."
April Ludgate,I hate doing Leslie's job.
April Ludgate,I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.
April Ludgate,"Tom, can you please help me?"
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,Or just do it?
Tom Haverford,"Come on, lil sparkle."
Tom Haverford,Don't give up.
Tom Haverford,What does Leslie always say?
April Ludgate,"I don't know, weird stuff about waffles."
Tom Haverford,"She says, ""you get out of a job what you put into it."""
Tom Haverford,You just need to find a project you're passionate about.
Tom Haverford,"For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages."
Tom Haverford,The Beeryonce Knowles.
Tom Haverford,"It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexyass mug."
Tom Haverford,Pairs nicely with the Jayzima.
Tom Haverford,We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,Maybe I should work at a bar.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Here are some papers Leslie requested.
Ann Perkins,These are blank.
Ron Swanson,Weird.
Ron Swanson,"As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?"
Ron Swanson,Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"When we dated, he made me do it every week."
Ron Swanson,What am I in for here?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, here's the deal."
Ann Perkins,"It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead."
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Leslie Knope,Are we okay?
Ben Wyatt,We are the opposite of okay.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Ben Wyatt,"To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter."
Ben Wyatt,"The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs."
Ben Wyatt,So they're closing it at the end of the week.
April Ludgate,That's where Champion came from.
Andy Dwyer,What will happen to all the other animals?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they'll be"
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,They'll be
Andy Dwyer,No!
Jerry Gergich,Guys.
Jennifer Barkley,"Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter."
Jennifer Barkley,"Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions."
Jennifer Barkley,"Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?"
Ben Wyatt,God.
Perd Hapley,"Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes."
Jennifer Barkley,"Say your goodbyes, Pebble 'Cause ""Weswie"" Knope gonna kill you."
Ben Wyatt,She got the perfect puppy for that shot.
Ben Wyatt,She is good.
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we can."
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning."
Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?
Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Which one?
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?
Leslie Knope,This one right here?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig."
Chris Traeger,This is the best meditation center in the area.
Ron Swanson,It doesn't look like much.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi."
Chris Traeger,"Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal."
Chris Traeger,"But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude."
Extra,"Excuse me, ladies."
Extra,On your right.
Chris Traeger,"After you, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.
Chris Traeger,Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.
Ron Swanson,I'll stand.
Chris Traeger,Interesting technique.
April Ludgate,"Andy, look at this little guy!"
April Ludgate,He's such a little runt.
April Ludgate,"Hey, there."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom, look."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I just had five cats on me at once!"
Andy Dwyer,You wanna come in here and try to break my record?
Tom Haverford,"That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance."
Tom Haverford,Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.
Ben Wyatt,"What's your endgame here, my dear?"
Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
April Ludgate,"Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?"
Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.
April Ludgate,They should be rewarded for not being people.
April Ludgate,I hate people.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April."
Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise canceling headphones."
Andy Dwyer,Pigs are awesome!
Ron Swanson,"All told, we were in there about six hours."
Ron Swanson,"And no, I was not meditating."
Ron Swanson,"I just stood there, quietly breathing."
Ron Swanson,There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
Ron Swanson,My mind was blank.
Ron Swanson,I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.
April Ludgate,"Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere."
April Ludgate,We can't let people see that.
April Ludgate,"I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,"You got it, boss."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages?"
Donna Meagle,Last one.
April Ludgate,Great.
Donna Meagle,"Each animal has a photo, special talents, and a personal history That I made up."
Donna Meagle,A lot of these dogs have rescued people from burning buildings.
Donna Meagle,This one helped Ray Charles around.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,This cat was in Boogie Nights?
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,You like this little guy?
Extra,He's so cute.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,All the animal are uptodate on their shots.
April Ludgate,And I think he likes you.
Andy Dwyer,He's pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Did you know his greatgrandfather was Spuds Mackenzie?
Extra,"What do you think, sweetie?"
Extra,Do you wanna take him home?
Extra,"Yes, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls."
Ben Wyatt,"This late in the game, it's killer."
Ben Wyatt,And that's a dog biscuit.
Leslie Knope,Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, we are out of time."
Ben Wyatt,We have to go back to them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,This is it.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Extra,"Oh, for God's sake, Leslie."
Extra,There's just not enough money to do all the things you wanna do.
Extra,You're trying to fit two ships into one bottle.
Extra,"Take it from me, you can't do that."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just look at this."
Ben Wyatt,"There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer."
Ben Wyatt,Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.
Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.
Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Extra,Interesting.
Leslie Knope,Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
Extra,"I know you're just making a joke, but using a bigger bottle would be considered cheating by most of our major trade publications."
Extra,FYI.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've radiated mindfulness."
Chris Traeger,What were you thinking about?
Ron Swanson,I wasn't thinking at all.
Chris Traeger,Incredible.
Chris Traeger,"It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try."
Ron Swanson,Don't try so hard.
Chris Traeger,Don't try so hard.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I'm going to try your ""not trying"" method right here, right now."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, wait."
Ron Swanson,"I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean."
Ron Swanson,I got nothing out of that experience at all.
Ron Swanson,So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it."
Chris Traeger,My one reservation about you as a coworker was that you seem inflexible.
Chris Traeger,"And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've got the job."
Chris Traeger,You wanna head back?
Ron Swanson,I do.
Ron Swanson,"But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing."
April Ludgate,Why is it so dead?
April Ludgate,Where is everyone?
Tom Haverford,Don't give up yet.
Tom Haverford,There's a few minutes left.
Extra,Is this where we drop off our unwanted cats?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,It's the opposite.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,I'm just gonna put these here for a second.
Extra,"And then, uh"
Andy Dwyer,We ended up with more animals than we started with.
April Ludgate,This is what happens when you try.
April Ludgate,All of these animals are gonna die.
April Ludgate,God!
April Ludgate,"I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town!"
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"Hey, you!"
April Ludgate,Get back here and get your [Bleep] cats out of there!
Leslie Knope,Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?
Ben Wyatt,Probably.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I don't know how else wait a second."
Ben Wyatt,Is that so am I Michelle?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, how is everyone?"
Leslie Knope,Great!
Ben Wyatt,Pretty good.
Leslie Knope,We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
Ann Perkins,That's great news.
Ann Perkins,Let me guess.
Ann Perkins,You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere?
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,Got rid of a bunch of lameass D1's from Public Works.
Ann Perkins,Awesome news.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks."
Ann Perkins,I'm getting fired.
Leslie Knope,what now?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.
Chris Traeger,I have found my assistant city manager.
Chris Traeger,You wanna guess who it is?
Chris Traeger,It's Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,I should've let you guess.
Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.
Councilman Houser,I'd put a pin in this for now.
Chris Traeger,Why?
Chris Traeger,Why pin it?
Councilman Houser,The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.
Councilman Houser,But one of the yes votes is retiring.
Councilman Houser,"If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy."
Chris Traeger,Why would he do that?
Councilman Houser,He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.
Councilman Houser,"Sorry, Chris."
Councilman Houser,If Newport wins You're gone.
Leslie Knope,I just need one more week.
Leslie Knope,And then I think
Extra,"Sorry, could you please Be careful?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I am always careful."
Andy Dwyer,We're good.
Leslie Knope,"If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this."
Extra,"Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more time."
Leslie Knope,With due respect
Extra,"Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing."
Extra,"But if you're ever gonna hold this job, there's something you need to understand."
Extra,City Council isn't about making everybody in town happy.
Extra,"In fact, every decision you make is gonna make a lot of people very unhappy."
Extra,We play with live ammo around here.
Extra,Now I'm gonna close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day.
Extra,So if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 P.M.
Extra,you let me know.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That's fair.
Andy Dwyer,I did it!
Andy Dwyer,I got it out.
Extra,"Oh, geez."
Extra,You don't take the ship out.
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Ron Swanson,Chris!
Ron Swanson,Great news!
Ron Swanson,I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.
Ron Swanson,Here's a hint no more departments.
Chris Traeger,"Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait."
Chris Traeger,"Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager."
Chris Traeger,So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.
Chris Traeger,I'm so so sorry.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that is disappointing."
Ron Swanson,But don't worry about me.
Ron Swanson,I'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?"
Chris Traeger,"We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'll see you when I see you."
Chris Traeger,I'm a rolling stone.
Chris Traeger,Peace.
Ron Swanson,Stop.
Ron Swanson,Have a seat.
Ron Swanson,"We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way."
Ron Swanson,Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time."
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what are you gonna do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go."
Leslie Knope,Or we find money somewhere else.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else."
Ben Wyatt,"This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund."
Ben Wyatt,Okay? Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,Stop talking.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna
Leslie Knope,Heh.
Leslie Knope,I'm No!
Ann Perkins,Do you? Unh.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I have a complete idea."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, it's me."
Tom Haverford,Tommy!
April Ludgate,I'm not here.
Tom Haverford,April.
April Ludgate,Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna come in for a second.
April Ludgate,Can you just leave me alone?
Tom Haverford,"Why so glum, sugar plum?"
April Ludgate,"Um, I don't know."
April Ludgate,Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.
April Ludgate,That's why it's stupid to work hard.
Tom Haverford,Let me show you something.
Tom Haverford,"Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy."
Tom Haverford,And this little puppy has a home.
Tom Haverford,"If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls."
Tom Haverford,"But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid."
Tom Haverford,And that puppy.
Tom Haverford,What what is that photo? That must come preloaded in there or something.
April Ludgate,#NAME?
Tom Haverford,#NAME?
April Ludgate,Fine.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,"Bye, pups! Bye, little piggies!"
Chris Traeger,"I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent!"
Ron Swanson,Nectar of the gods.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I should get back to my office."
Chris Traeger,As long as I have one.
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in."
Ron Swanson,But you might consider the upside of losing your job.
Chris Traeger,For example?
Ron Swanson,"You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people."
Ron Swanson,"Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man."
Ron Swanson,That's just one way it might be good.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure there are others.
Chris Traeger,I'm sure there are.
Jennifer Barkley,Uh-oh.
Jennifer Barkley,You look serious.
Jennifer Barkley,What's on the agenda?
Leslie Knope,"Just one item, Jennifer."
Leslie Knope,You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, that's that's, um that is a great idea."
Jennifer Barkley,"In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already."
Jennifer Barkley,Damn it.
Jennifer Barkley,Damn it! I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, the water's not good for you either."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Leslie Knope,Has anyone told you that yet?
Ben Wyatt,"In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign."
Ben Wyatt,That's all we ask.
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?"
Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget."
Ben Wyatt,"And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old department"
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, what's in it for you?"
Leslie Knope,"A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget."
Jennifer Barkley,I wasn't born yesterday.
Jennifer Barkley,You've gotta have an angle.
Jennifer Barkley,This is a home run for us! We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you can have this week."
Ben Wyatt,We'll take the next one.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?"
Leslie Knope,"Because in a week, we have a debate."
Leslie Knope,"And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna kick his ass.
Leslie Knope,She'll take care of that.
Leslie Knope,See ya next week!
Chris Traeger,How's my best buddy? Just bought this.
Chris Traeger,Cranium.
Chris Traeger,It's a board game.
Chris Traeger,Have you heard of it? It is literally the most fun I have ever had.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say, after work, you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium? Ron?"
April Ludgate,"Chris? Sorry, he's meditating."
April Ludgate,He asked me to tell anyone who comes in that he wishes to remain undisturbed so as to better clarify his head space.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, God, Ron."
Chris Traeger,I am so sorry.
Chris Traeger,I'll let you get at it.
