Character,Line
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need you to go up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on the fourth floor.
Ron Swanson,We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to go to the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,That is the creepiest place on Earth.
Leslie Knope,The fourth floor is awful.
Leslie Knope,"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced."
Ron Swanson,"They'll only talk to you or me, and I can't go, because I don't want to."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Stranger,"Hey, boo."
Stranger,You're pretty.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Thank you, sir."
Stranger,"Hey, girl."
Stranger,Are you on probation?
Stranger,I got clean urine.
Stranger,You need female?
Stranger,I got female.
Leslie Knope,"I'm good, thank you."
Stranger,"Hey, you clean?"
Stranger,"I buy, too."
Background,Order.
Background,Order!
Background,Next case.
Background,Indiana vs--
Leslie Knope,Tom and Wendy?
Extra,Popcorn?
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?"
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,Took a risk.
Tom Haverford,Bought some shoes online.
Tom Haverford,"Paid off handsomely, as you can see."
Leslie Knope,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?"
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,You heard about my divorce?
Leslie Knope,I saw you on the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so, so sorry."
Tom Haverford,"Honestly, it's fine."
Tom Haverford,"Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know what those are.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Tom, stop working."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Would have been nice to have saved that.
Leslie Knope,You should've autosaved that.
Tom Haverford,Right.
Leslie Knope,That kind of feels like your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.
Leslie Knope,You love her.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine."
Tom Haverford,"Look, look at my face."
Tom Haverford,Are you watching?
Leslie Knope,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, marriage is number seven."
Leslie Knope,"So, watch out, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's all bad.
Leslie Knope,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake."
Ron Swanson,I think Tom seems fine.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is the problem."
Leslie Knope,"Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray."
Leslie Knope,We have to help him.
Leslie Knope,We are his safe bubble.
April Ludgate,She's kind of right.
April Ludgate,"None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons."
Ron Swanson,This seems like none of our business.
Leslie Knope,"Be supportive, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!"""
Leslie Knope,"""No, no, says I!"""
April Ludgate,That was a really good Ron.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know how to explain--
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,What a coincidence!
Andy Dwyer,Are you in this office purely for business reasons?
Ann Perkins,"Pleasure, actually."
Ann Perkins,My boyfriend Mark works here.
Ann Perkins,He's sitting right next to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,"What a surprise, running into you all day, every day, every single place that we are."
Andy Dwyer,Likewise.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll see you guys around."
Ann Perkins,See you.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extra small condoms you ordered."
Andy Dwyer,"I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order."
Andy Dwyer,"Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well."
Andy Dwyer,Something they've never dealt with before.
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Mark never asked me for any small, weirdly shaped condoms."
Andy Dwyer,I made that up.
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship."
Andy Dwyer,"Weakening it, little by little."
Extra,Where's Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,For [bleep] sake.
Extra,"So, you had a divorce , of course, of course"
Extra,"And no one enjoys a divorce, of course"
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do, man."
Tom Haverford,"I can't be like, ""Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine."""
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in."
Ron Swanson,Here's what you do.
Ron Swanson,"Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it."
Ron Swanson,That'll make her feel better.
Ron Swanson,She'll get off your jock.
Tom Haverford,You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.
Tom Haverford,Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.
Ron Swanson,Damn the man.
Ron Swanson,"Well, hey, your secret's safe with me."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, everyone."
Tom Haverford,The rumors are true.
Tom Haverford,Wendy and I are splitting up.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm really hurt."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?"
Leslie Knope,We'll make it Tom's night.
Leslie Knope,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house."
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to a restaurant--
Tom Haverford,Strip club?
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Leslie Knope,Noâ¦
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Leslie Knope,You did.
Tom Haverford,I definitely heard someone say strip club.
Leslie Knope,You just did.
Tom Haverford,Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,There is a great dinosaur themed restaurant in Patterson.
Jerry Gergich,It is called Jurassic Fork.
Jerry Gergich,I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Dinosaurs, huh?"
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Sounds okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!"
Leslie Knope,I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.m.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Waiter,Hi.
Waiter,"Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite."
Waiter,You ready to order?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Veloci-Wrap.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please."
Waiter,How do you want that cooked?
Leslie Knope,Medium roar.
Waiter,Medium rare?
Leslie Knope,"No, medium roar."
Waiter,"For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore."
Tom Haverford,"I'll have the surf and turf- asaurus, and a couple of bottles of wine."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing."
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna be drinking anything.
Ann Perkins,Just wanted everybody to know that.
Ann Perkins,I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.
Ann Perkins,"I ordered a Tyranna-Caesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,They got pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Mark, you want to play a quick game?"
Andy Dwyer,Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, we'll put a little money on it."
Andy Dwyer,Make it a little more interesting.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, please."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool."
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,That worked?
Andy Dwyer,"How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, find the person you want to hustle."
Andy Dwyer,Invite them to play pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Should they accept, you're in."
Leslie Knope,Here's what I think we should do.
Leslie Knope,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.
Jerry Gergich,I'll start.
Jerry Gergich,I really wish I could have your body.
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was weird, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go ahead."
Ann Perkins,I think Tom is really nice.
Ann Perkins,"Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.
Leslie Knope,Just enjoy yourself.
Leslie Knope,"April, go ahead."
April Ludgate,Tom is the only cool person in the office.
Leslie Knope,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Donna Meagle,"I love you, Tom."
Donna Meagle,You're my little prince.
Donna Meagle,I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, garcon."
Tom Haverford,I'm still feeling pretty sad.
Tom Haverford,Can I get two creme brulees and another glass of bronto grigio?
Leslie Knope,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad."
Leslie Knope,Why would he do that?
Mark Brendanawicz,And that's game.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think you now owe me 25 dollars.
Andy Dwyer,Shoot.
Andy Dwyer,"Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,What do you say we play again?
Andy Dwyer,We'll make it a little more interesting.
Andy Dwyer,Go double or nothing?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why not?
Andy Dwyer,Step two.
Andy Dwyer,Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.
Andy Dwyer,Step two has been completed easily.
Andy Dwyer,Very easily.
Andy Dwyer,Mark is pretty good at pool.
Ron Swanson,"So, how are you feeling, Tom?"
Ron Swanson,Are you feeling okay?
Tom Haverford,I like pretending to be sad.
Tom Haverford,I now see why girls do it.
Ron Swanson,"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances."
Ron Swanson,"Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy."
Ron Swanson,"Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, why not?"
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna take a leak.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"That would be 6,400 dollars."
Mark Brendanawicz,I accept checks and most major credit cards.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Mark is way better than me.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna... I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I think I'm done, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Forget money.
Andy Dwyer,We'll play for something else.
Mark Brendanawicz,You have nothing else to give me.
Andy Dwyer,I have a T-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.
Andy Dwyer,It's literally priceless.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, how about this?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann."
Andy Dwyer,What are you talking about?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to leave us alone.
Andy Dwyer,"That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if I win, I also get Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, fine."
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, then you get Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Rack them up!
April Ludgate,Somebody punch someone!
Leslie Knope,"So, how you doing, buddy?"
Leslie Knope,Want some steak?
Leslie Knope,Champagne?
Leslie Knope,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,A cheese fountain?
Leslie Knope,A ruby?
Leslie Knope,A goose heart?
Tom Haverford,How about a marriage?
Tom Haverford,How about a non-divorce?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, think about it."
Tom Haverford,Does our marriage really make sense to you?
Tom Haverford,"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon."
Tom Haverford,"I'm a short, beautiful government employee slash club promoter."
Leslie Knope,You're a club promoter?
Tom Haverford,Aspiring.
Tom Haverford,"The point is, I never meant anything to her."
Tom Haverford,It wasn't even a real marriage.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex."
Leslie Knope,I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, crap."
Leslie Knope,We are going to the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,What?
Donna Meagle,Not me.
Donna Meagle,I can't go back there.
Donna Meagle,"But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take April home.
April Ludgate,"No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory."
Leslie Knope,"Well, drop out of school and start doing meth."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, everybody."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot unsee."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a feminist, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I would never, ever go to a strip club."
Leslie Knope,"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality."""
Leslie Knope,But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.
Leslie Knope,So don't blow this.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Lap dances are on me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm paying for them."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna actually be on me.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?"
Leslie Knope,'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.
Tom Haverford,There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.
Tom Haverford,"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I've been a little down."
Tom Haverford,Totally natural.
Tom Haverford,I'm getting divorced.
Tom Haverford,"But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some g-strings."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,It is rough in here.
Leslie Knope,Is it always like this?
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't know.
Ron Swanson,Don't like strip clubs.
Ron Swanson,Smells like a wet mop in here.
Ron Swanson,And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.
Leslie Knope,"You're one of the good ones, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Wait a minute.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, beautiful."
Ron Swanson,Strippers do nothing for me.
Ron Swanson,"I like a strong, salt of the earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field."
Ron Swanson,"Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses."
Ron Swanson,"But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place."
Ron Swanson,"Tom cat, pull up a mouth."
Ron Swanson,This buffet is unstoppable.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm not hungry."
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're doing a bang-up job of looking sad about Wendy."
Ron Swanson,Does she make scrambled eggs?
Tom Haverford,No.
Ron Swanson,Take it down a notch.
Ron Swanson,"You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio."
Announcer,Coming on stage next is Angel.
Announcer,Angel!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you."
Andy Dwyer,Scratch on the eight!
Andy Dwyer,I'm victorious.
Andy Dwyer,I am awesome at pool and I hustled your ass.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, take a moment to say goodbye."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know how to say this.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays."
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, you tried."
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess you're his now.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to get out of here?
Mark Brendanawicz,I do.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,This is Seabiscuit.
Sierra,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's loud in here.
Leslie Knope,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I don't want to do that."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I already paid her."
Leslie Knope,Can I get my money back?
Sierra,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let her do her writhing."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I just gotta say, Sierra."
Leslie Knope,"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting."
Leslie Knope,"But go crazy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Give my friend here the works.
Leslie Knope,Really grind the sorrow out of him.
Sierra,You got it.
Leslie Knope,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away."
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Stripper dancing action!
Tom Haverford,This isn't working.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to do this.
Leslie Knope,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,It's because I'm miserable.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Seabiscuit."
Leslie Knope,That'll be all.
Announcer,"All Glitter Factory girls, please come backstage."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Tom Haverford,I don't know what's wrong with me.
Tom Haverford,This is honestly the saddest I've ever been.
Announcer,Glitter Bomb! Ah!
Tom Haverford,I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.
Tom Haverford,"That girl up there, she's my emergency contact."
Tom Haverford,"But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over."
Leslie Knope,It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.
Tom Haverford,Sixty days.
Tom Haverford,And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,What? Ron?
Tom Haverford,He's gonna ask her out.
Tom Haverford,He told me.
Tom Haverford,But who cares?
Tom Haverford,"If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy."
Leslie Knope,Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?
Ron Swanson,It's complicated.
Leslie Knope,"What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy."
Leslie Knope,I don't get men.
Leslie Knope,"If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives."
Leslie Knope,It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,"Good, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?"
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,From the knees.
Ron Swanson,He weighs eight pounds.
Wendy,Oh! Oh.
Wendy,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Wendy."
Leslie Knope,"We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink."
Wendy,Oh!
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You insensitive little hussy.
Wendy,Excuse me?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, whoa."
Ron Swanson,Halt.
Leslie Knope,You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?
Extra,You're married?
Wendy,Uh... Technically.
Wendy,"Yeah, that's... That's my husband."
Extra,Who's he carrying?
Wendy,No.
Wendy,"No, that's his... That's his boss."
Wendy,My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss.
Ron Swanson,How's it going?
Extra,Good.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other."
Leslie Knope,You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,You have a lovely home.
Ron Swanson,"So, where do you want this?"
Leslie Knope,"So, how you feeling? Rough morning?"
Tom Haverford,You know those hangover pills you can order on TV?
Tom Haverford,I threw up a bunch of them this morning.
Tom Haverford,I feel much better.
Leslie Knope,"I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I need to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Tom Haverford,The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Wendy's from Canada.
Leslie Knope,Oh! Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Start again.
Mark Brendanawicz,This--
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Mark.
Andy Dwyer,You guys got a second? It's about last night.
Ann Perkins,I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me.
Andy Dwyer,Of course not.
Andy Dwyer,I never for one second thought that that was for real.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore."
Andy Dwyer,"You clearly have something going, and I should respect that."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"If you say ""psych"" right now I'm gonna be really pissed."
Andy Dwyer,"You remembered how much I like to say ""psych."""
Andy Dwyer,"But no, no."
Andy Dwyer,This is no psych.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, thank you for saying all that just now."
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, A-Cakes."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, oh."
Andy Dwyer,"I thought for a second you were gonna chase after me right there, but you didn't, and that's okay."
Andy Dwyer,I meant every word I said.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you like your wife?"
Leslie Knope,That's a bummer.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else know that you like your wife? Does your wife know that you like your wife?
Tom Haverford,I didn't know until yesterday.
Tom Haverford,So don't tell anyone.
Tom Haverford,Don't tell Ron.
Tom Haverford,It's my problem.
Leslie Knope,How could there possibly still be glitter on me?
Tom Haverford,It takes forever to get off.
Tom Haverford,My crotch looks like a disco ball.
Extra,"Leslie's sorry, She called you selfish, of course, She just didn't know the full story, of course, But now that she does, She's sorry, of course, She loves being your deputy."
