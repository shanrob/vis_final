April Ludgate,"""I've been wearing a bandana as underwear for three days now."""
April Ludgate,"Look, there's a picture."
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,That's horrifying.
April Ludgate,I love him so much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so do you have the results of the study?"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, and they're great."
Ann Perkins,Your tax on soda would definitely lower diabetes in this town.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and I have a great prop for the meeting."
Ann Perkins,"This is the amount of sugar that the average Pawnee from soda, every month."
Leslie Knope,That is gross.
Ann Perkins,It's gross.
Leslie Knope,All that sugar?
Ann Perkins,It's really gross.
Leslie Knope,What a powerful image.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What did you put in the sugar?
Leslie Knope,It's so good.
Leslie Knope,My first act as a city councilwoman I've proposed a tax on all those giant sugary sodas so we can discourage people from drinking them.
Leslie Knope,"I believe, with my help, all local restaurants can get healthier Paunch Burger, Big and Wide, The Fat Sack, Coronel Plum's Slop Trough which was formerly Sue's Salads until we ran that out of town."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, councilwoman."
Ron Swanson,"In honor of your neverending quest to personally babysit each and every American citizen, I went to Paunch Burger and got myself a Number two Double Bacon Grenade Deluxe, hash browns, chili cheese fries, and one poached egg."
Ann Perkins,Ugh!
Ann Perkins,Number two is right.
Ron Swanson,I also picked up a 64ounce Sweetums Sugar Splash.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, I love this country so much."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,"Our political differences aside, I am about to go to my first committee meeting as a city councilwoman."
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to say to you.
Ron Swanson,Please don't.
Leslie Knope,"I know you hate feelings and emotions, but I would not be where I am if it wasn't for you."
Leslie Knope,You hired me.
Leslie Knope,You've always supported me.
Leslie Knope,How can I ever repay you?
Ron Swanson,Get me a refill.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I've been going over your reports."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's try to be consistent with our fonts, okay? There's a crazy amount in these memos."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, people. Consistent font usage, come on."
Ben Wyatt,"Times New Roman, across the board."
Ben Wyatt,"No Geneva, no Garamond, definitely no Papyrus."
April Ludgate,Papyrus?
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,There's no place for that in a professional office setting.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, April."
Ben Wyatt,"These college interns really need to be whipped into shape, but don't worry, because they call me Devo, 'cause I can ""whip 'em good."""
Ben Wyatt,And obviously make sure the content's perfect too.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and, uh, 12 point."
Ben Wyatt,13's just obnoxious.
Ben Wyatt,Great meeting.
Chris Traeger,"Out of the way, people."
Chris Traeger,Motivational brigade coming through.
Donna Meagle,Ho ho!
Donna Meagle,"So, you boys are gonna go work out together, huh?"
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Donna Meagle,Whereabouts?
Chris Traeger,Community college.
Donna Meagle,"Eh, that's too far."
Andy Dwyer,Chris and Tom offered to help me train to become a police officer.
Andy Dwyer,"The physical exam is about three months away and I am in terrible shape, but I can already do this So, I'm getting there."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I've got a list of everything that I'm supposed to be able to do to get into the police academy, and number one is, ""be able to run 2 miles in under 25 minutes."""
Andy Dwyer,"That's a typo, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, that's humanly impossible."
Chris Traeger,"When you are able to focus your mind and your body, anything is possible."
Tom Haverford,Anything is possible!
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their ""small size"" option to a whopping 64ounces."
Kathryn Pinewood,"That's correct, and it's great for the consumer."
Kathryn Pinewood,More bang for the buck.
Kathryn Pinewood,Are we putting bargains on trial here?
Ann Perkins,"How could any sane person call that ""small""?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, if the customer truly wants a smaller size, there is an option."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you mean the ""li'I swallow""?"
Ann Perkins,Does anybody buy that?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Some girls buy them for their dollhouses, but they're not very popular."
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, for only a nickel more, you get 64 ounces."
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128ounce option."
Leslie Knope,"Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the ""regular."""
Leslie Knope,"Then, there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call ""child size."""
Leslie Knope,"""How is this a ""childsize soda""?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, it's roughly the size of a two year old child, if the child were liquefied."
Kathryn Pinewood,It's a real bargain at $1.59.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"It's not my place to speak for the consumer, but everyone should buy it."
Chris Traeger,"Come on, Andy, come on."
Chris Traeger,You can do it.
Chris Traeger,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
Chris Traeger,"Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,It's so hot.
Andy Dwyer,It was horrible.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm going to die."
Andy Dwyer,I'm so tired.
Andy Dwyer,Everything hurts.
Andy Dwyer,Running is impossible.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,"Tom, now is not the time for criticism."
Chris Traeger,How did he do?
Tom Haverford,Andy finished his twomile run in 29 minutes and 43 seconds.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,I'm never gonna be a cop.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna have to be a robber.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Hang in there, pal."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna drive around.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Not because of what you did, which was terrible, but because of what I'm going to be able to get you to do."
Chris Traeger,I guess I'm proud of me.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, man."
Andy Dwyer,Me too.
Chris Traeger,We have so much work to do.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ellis, have you put the campaign pictures up on the website?"
Ellis,Oh.
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,I started doing them.
Ben Wyatt,And are you going to finish doing them?
Ellis,Oh.
Ellis,"Later, man."
April Ludgate,"I actually think you look really good, except for the stick up your butt."
Ben Wyatt,Who do you think drew it?
Ben Wyatt,Was it Nathaniel?
Ben Wyatt,Ellis?
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I feel like these interns do not respect or like me at all."
April Ludgate,"Honestly, you could loosen up a bit on the font stuff. And everything in general."
Ben Wyatt,"God, this is insane."
Ben Wyatt,They're interns.
Ben Wyatt,"They're totally replaceable, and I'm their boss."
Ben Wyatt,Just fire them.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, hey, Jen."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I'm having a problem with some of the interns."
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking of making some changes.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Turns out Ellis is Congressman Murray's nephew.
Ben Wyatt,Nathaniel is related to Donald Rumsfeld.
Ben Wyatt,Brittany's dad is Ben Bernanke's dentist.
Ben Wyatt,Every single one of these little twerps is seriously connected.
Ben Wyatt,"So, new plan."
Ben Wyatt,"Instead of firing them, I am going to kiss their asses like crazy."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Ms. Knope, this is about consumer rights, and if they don't want to drink our delicious sodas, we do provide healthier options, like water zero."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about water zero.
Leslie Knope,"The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that misleading?
Kathryn Pinewood,"The zero on the label refers to the amount of water in it, which is zero."
Kathryn Pinewood,"If you want zero calorie water, try diet water zero lite."
Kathryn Pinewood,It has only 60 calories.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think we're done here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, councilwoman, one more thing."
Kathryn Pinewood,"If your tax bill passes, local restaurants will hurt badly."
Kathryn Pinewood,We'll have to lay off about 100 people.
Leslie Knope,You're bluffing.
Leslie Knope,She's bluffing.
Leslie Knope,Are you bluffing?
Kathryn Pinewood,"The second your tax bill passes, this press release goes wide."
Kathryn Pinewood,See you at the meeting.
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope Soda Tax Forces Massive Layoffs."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need some sugar.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no!"
Ann Perkins,Stop it!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you stop it right now!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,"I proposed this bill, but the issue has become very complicated, so before I decide how I am going to vote, I'd love to hear from both sides."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Extra,"Yeah, I work at Colonel Plump's, and word around the Slop Trough is, they're talking about laying people off."
Extra,"So, maybe you could get off your high horse and help me keep my job."
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Well, sir, I may vote against the tax, because, frankly, I don't take job losses lightly."
Extra,No.
Extra,I want the tax.
Extra,"My husband started drinking those giant sodas, and he's gained 100 pounds in three months."
Extra,"Consequently, we haven't had sex in ten years."
Ann Perkins,II thought you said he gained weight in the last three months.
Extra,"Well, we have lots of other problems."
Leslie Knope,"Well, ma'am, my original stance was that implementing this tax would be good for public health."
Extra,All taxation is theft!
Extra,"If the government can tax me, I can I can do this."
Leslie Knope,"Grover, give that woman her purse back."
Extra,There's a lot of pill bottles in here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Been making some modifications to the pace car.
Tom Haverford,"Speaker system, Mad Men bar, iPad dock, and bam!"
Tom Haverford,Orange racing stripe.
Tom Haverford,It's a perfect recreation of Han Lue's Nissan in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Tom Haverford,"Weirdly, so far, no one has noticed."
Chris Traeger,I want to find something that really motivates you.
Chris Traeger,Why do you want to achieve this goal?
Andy Dwyer,I just want to get a good job for me and April.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,Keep going.
Chris Traeger,Dig.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, I love April."
Andy Dwyer,I think she's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,She's all I care about in the whole world.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Love and family.
Chris Traeger,"What else is there, really?"
Andy Dwyer,Nothing at all.
Chris Traeger,"I exercise because, when I was a baby, I had a rare blood disorder, and I suppose I need to feel like my body's in tiptop shape Ah."
Chris Traeger,"So it doesn't destroy me, leaving me to die alone."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"You got yours, I got mine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go run till I puke.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Guess what's in these boxes, everybody?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Pizza.
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody chill out.
Ben Wyatt,Take a pizza break on me.
Ben Wyatt,"Ellis, what's up, my male?"
Ben Wyatt,"You grab a slice of 'za, brah."
Ellis,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, dude, do you play Ultimate?"
Ellis,"Yeah, I play intramural at Georgetown."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, so did I, in college."
April Ludgate,"Whoa, you guys should get married."
Ben Wyatt,We should play tomorrow morning in the park.
Ellis,What about the website?
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,You can put those pics up anytime.
Ben Wyatt,"We should lock down some tight disc grabs, am I right, ellbones?"
Ellis,"Yeah, it sounds good."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ellis,It's better than working.
Ben Wyatt,"No doubt, no doubt."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, listen up, pizza lovers."
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, prework Ultimate in the park."
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's invited.
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,"Let's do it to it, my dudes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anyone else?"
Extra,"Yeah, if we put a tax on soda, I mean, what's next, income?"
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you don't pay your income tax?"
Extra,Whether or not I pay income tax is none of the government's business.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, no, actually, it is."
Extra,"Well, you don't know my name or what I look like, so good luck finding me."
Extra,"I think we should tax all bad things, like racism and women's vaginas."
Ann Perkins,We're not taxing anyone's genitals.
Extra,Then what the hell are we doing here?
Extra,"Come on, boys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um, let's take a quick straw poll."
Leslie Knope,Hold up green if you agree and red if you disagree.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,"""The soda tax is good and will help people get healthier."""
Leslie Knope,"So, about half?"
Ann Perkins,Half.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, ""the soda tax is bad and unfair to consumers."""
Leslie Knope,Half and half.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,This is very confusing.
Extra,I've got an idea.
Extra,"Maybe instead of me losing my job, you ought to lose your job."
Extra,Let's recall Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this!
Ben Wyatt,Nice catch!
Ben Wyatt,Someone please tell me we kodaked that moment.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, rocked that scoober!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"You got it, Howie!"
Ben Wyatt,"All right, April, what's the score?"
April Ludgate,1000 to 7.
Ben Wyatt,"Good sportsmanship, bro."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, repeat after me."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"""I run for April."""
Andy Dwyer,I run for April.
Tom Haverford,"Run for your wife, son!"
Chris Traeger,"""I run for love."""
Andy Dwyer,I run for love.
Tom Haverford,"Playaz, at your marks."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you run for again, Chris?"
Chris Traeger,Nobody.
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,Does it really even matter?
Tom Haverford,Get set.
Tom Haverford,Get at me!
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, you okay?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,There's something wrong with my body.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Chris Traeger,My legs aren't working.
Chris Traeger,I'm broken.
Chris Traeger,I need to go to the hospital and see a doctor right away.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Ann Perkins,You look weird.
Leslie Knope,So do you.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,You always look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I couldn't sleep a wink last night, so at 5:00 in the morning, I went to Paunch Burger for a pickmeup."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't decide what kind of soda I wanted, so I had them put all six in one cup."
Leslie Knope,You know what it tastes like?
Ann Perkins,Disgusting?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna vote?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"If I vote for the tax, then I might lose my job, and if I vote against it, I might be betraying my own bill."
Leslie Knope,It's like I'm floating in this giant river of ambiguity.
Leslie Knope,I'm under a warm waterfall of uncertainty.
Ann Perkins,Do you just have to pee real bad?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I've lost all of my instincts.
Leslie Knope,I'm lost.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna have to wait, and when they call my name, I'll do what my gut tells me to do."
Ethel Beavers,Councilman Howser?
Councilman Howser,Aye.
Ethel Beavers,Councilman Howser votes aye.
Ethel Beavers,"Councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?"
Extra,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Uhh!
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, it appears that I have fallen ill."
Leslie Knope,"Mayhaps, might I suggest that we have a aah!"
Leslie Knope,Can we take a recess?
Ann Perkins,Well.
Ann Perkins,"your pulse is super fast, but that wouldn't be out of line for someone who drank and then barfed up a gallon of sugar water."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm a mess."
Leslie Knope,"Everything's upside down, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, when I used to just work here, I was always so sure of myself."
Leslie Knope,Now everything is different.
Jerry Gergich,Geez.
Jerry Gergich,Do you guys know how to dissolve super glue?
Ann Perkins,"Well, not everything's different, right?"
Leslie Knope,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ellis."
Ben Wyatt,Ellbow.
Ben Wyatt,Ellchupacabra.
Ben Wyatt,Drinkin' coffee.
Ellis,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's it's a it's from 40 years ago."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, that was really fun this morning, huh?"
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,"Yeah, totally."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,Did you draw that?
Ellis,"Uh, no, I didn't."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's really good.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're a you're a great artist."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I can't do this."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't care who you're related to."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm your boss, and you can't keep disrespecting me like this."
Ellis,"Hey, man, I didn't draw it."
Ellis,Your daughter did.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ellis,Her.
Ben Wyatt,April's not my daughter.
Ben Wyatt,She's my friend.
Ben Wyatt,Does everyone think she's my daughter?
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, she would never do that to me."
April Ludgate,"Sorry, Dad."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, my rock, my steady, guiding light."
Leslie Knope,"O Captain, my Captain."
Ron Swanson,Did you get that soda refill I asked for?
Leslie Knope,"I need you, Ron, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'm in big trouble.
Leslie Knope,"I need to go back to those chambers in 20 minutes, and I have to cast a vote, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the people at the public forum said they might want to fire me."
Ron Swanson,So what? I've tried to fire you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,Be serious.
Ron Swanson,I was not joking.
Ron Swanson,Here is your personnel file.
Ron Swanson,See for yourself.
Leslie Knope,"""Brilliant work."""
Leslie Knope,"""Commendation."""
Leslie Knope,"""Above and beyond."""
Ron Swanson,Keep reading.
Leslie Knope,"""Request for termination""? You tried to fire me once?"
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,I tried to fire you four times.
Leslie Knope,What you me four four fired times?
Ron Swanson,"If you need to boot again, the trash can's on your right."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what'd the doc say? Everything okay?"
Chris Traeger,"The tests and blood work came back, and the news is terrible."
Chris Traeger,They found nothing.
Tom Haverford,Nothing?
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,The silent killer.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"Chris, that means everything's okay."
Tom Haverford,Why weren't you at practice this morning?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you should have been there."
Andy Dwyer,I finally hit my minimum requirement.
Andy Dwyer,Minimum champion!
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to die one day, probably, without ever having left my mark on this silly, little planet."
Chris Traeger,"I'm gonna die an anonymous, meaningless speck of dust."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,It sounds like you're really going through some tough stuff right now.
Andy Dwyer,It's too bad there's not doctors for your mind.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, well, hey, I'm gonna go run some more laps."
Andy Dwyer,Will you time me? Go.
Tom Haverford,"He's kind of right, Chris."
Tom Haverford,You were freaking out because you were thinking about Andy and his family and how you don't have one.
Tom Haverford,"Every time something tiny goes wrong, you spiral like crazy."
Tom Haverford,Maybe you should see a therapist.
Tom Haverford,I hope I'm not out of line.
Chris Traeger,"Au contraire, mon frere."
Chris Traeger,"You are as ""in line"" as a person can be."
Chris Traeger,You are a genius and an amazing motivator.
Andy Dwyer,What was my time?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,43?
Andy Dwyer,Yes! New record.
Chris Traeger,"All my life, I have tried to achieve external goals."
Chris Traeger,"Run a four-minute mile, climb Mount Everest."
Chris Traeger,"But before I can do that, I need to climb the Mount Everest of my mind."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,Why did you try to get me fired?
Ron Swanson,"The first year you worked here, you drove me nuts."
Ron Swanson,"I would say no to something you wanted to do, and you'd ignore me or go over my head and do it anyway."
Ron Swanson,"You were insubordinate, stubborn, a pain in my ass, and, worst of all, bubbly."
Leslie Knope,I was a dedicated public servant.
Ron Swanson,Right.
Ron Swanson,That was the worst thing you were.
Ron Swanson,"The point is, I ended up withdrawing all four requests to have you fired, because, ultimately, I'd rather work with a person of conviction than a wishywashy kissass."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had conviction because I knew what I believed in, but I know with this new job."
Leslie Knope,I just feel like I've lost my bearings.
Ron Swanson,"No, you haven't."
Ron Swanson,"You may have wandered into unknown terrain, but you're still you."
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna pull out some embarrassing photo of me from high school?
Ron Swanson,Take this compass.
Ron Swanson,All great adventurers need one.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"And, listen, as far as this firing stuff goes, I won't forget and I will never forgive you."
Ron Swanson,There she is.
April Ludgate,"Here's that report you wanted, boss."
April Ludgate,It's funny because it has 30 different fonts on it and you only like one.
April Ludgate,Do you like it?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's hilarious."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you."
April Ludgate,I was just messing around.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you may not take this seriously, but this job is important to me."
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, you should take it seriously, because I asked you to come work here because I thought you'd enjoy it and I think you're smart, but you have to have some semblance of professionalism, and I need you to give, like, even a 15% effort."
April Ludgate,12%.
Ben Wyatt,15
Ben Wyatt,"For God's sake, I'm asking for 15% effort."
Ben Wyatt,It's not supposed to be a negotiation.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,15
Ethel Beavers,"City councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?"
Leslie Knope,Aye.
Leslie Knope,Strongly in favor.
Ethel Beavers,"The soda tax measure passes, 3 to 2."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm very pleased with my vote because I voted my conscience."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, she's totally bluffing about laying people off, you watch."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I may have made some enemies today, but that is part of the job."
Leslie Knope,"And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends."
Leslie Knope,Stranger things have happened.
Ron Swanson,Let's keep it down out there.
Ellis,"Yeah, I love cupcakes."
April Ludgate,"Ellis hates you, and he has herpes."
Ellis,"Hey, what's your problem?"
April Ludgate,"My problem is you, Smellis."
April Ludgate,"Ben told you to finish the website, and if you don't do it, I swear to God, I'm gonna murder you in your sleep."
April Ludgate,I know where you live. 14th street right?
April Ludgate,"I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around."
April Ludgate,Do you understand me?
Ellis,Yes.
April Ludgate,Do it.
