Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator. Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem.

I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project. The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam. We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding. To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises. One penis in particular. Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media. Rule number one, stay on message. This is key. All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park. And that's it. Okay? Number two: What? Stay on message again? Yes, it's that important. It's one and two.

And they made his legs into rain sticks. And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer. Today is a great day for the Knope family.

But right now, I'd like to make a toast. When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better. That's what public service is all about. Small, incremental change, every day. Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."" And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love. I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana. I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor. And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me. Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work. Not to say that public service isn't sexy. Because it definitely is. But that's not why we do it. We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love.
